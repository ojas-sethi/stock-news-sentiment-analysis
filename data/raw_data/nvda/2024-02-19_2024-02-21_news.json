[{"date": "2024-02-21T23:55:01+00:00", "title": "Nvidia Surges After AI Boom Shows No Signs of Letting Up", "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp. surged in late trading after delivering another eye-popping sales forecast, adding fresh momentum to a stock rally that already made it the world\u2019s most valuable chipmaker.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nNvidia Surges After AI Boom Shows No Signs of Letting Up Tech Up in Late Hours on Nvidia\u2019s Bullish Outlook: Markets Wrap Your 401(k) Will Be Gone Within a Decade Biden Touts $1.2 Billion in Student Loan Relief With Eye to 2024 China Tightens Grip on Stocks With Net Sale Ban at Open, Close\n\nRevenue in the current period will be about $24 billion, the company said in a statement Wednesday. Analysts had predicted $21.9 billion on average. Results in the fourth quarter also sailed past Wall Street estimates.\n\nThe outlook extends a streak of Nvidia shattering expectations, thanks to insatiable demand for its artificial intelligence accelerators \u2014 highly prized chips that crunch data for AI models. The technology has helped power a proliferation of chatbots and other generative AI services, which can create text and graphics based on simple prompts.\n\n\u201cAccelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said in the statement. \u201cDemand is surging worldwide across companies, industries and nations.\u201d\n\nThe shares jumped as much as 11% in extended trading following the announcement. They earlier closed at $674.72 in New York, leaving them up 36% for the year.\n\nNvidia\u2019s market capitalization increased by more than $400 billion this year \u2014 bringing its valuation to $1.7 trillion \u2014 as investors bet that the company will remain the prime beneficiary of an AI computing boom.\n\nThat turned Wednesday\u2019s report into a highly anticipated event for both Wall Street and the tech world. And the numbers \u2014 along with the upbeat tone from Huang \u2014 renewed confidence that spending will stay strong.\n\nShares of Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Broadcom Inc. and Marvell Technology Inc. \u2014 three other chipmakers expected to benefit from AI growth \u2014 also gained in late trading.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cThe entire market is watching this report and expectations have been elevated,\u201d Wolfe Research analyst Chris Caso said in a note. Guidance was strong enough to \u201cdemonstrate continued momentum, while also leaving room for continued upside through the second half.\u201d\n\nNew Cycle\n\nOn a conference call with analysts, Huang said that demand for Nvidia\u2019s newest products will continue to outstrip supply for the rest of the year. Though supply is growing, demand isn\u2019t showing any signs of slowing, he said.\n\n\u201cGenerative AI has kicked off a whole new investment cycle,\u201d Huang said. That will lead to a doubling of the world\u2019s data center installed base over the next five years and \u201crepresent an annual market opportunity in the hundreds of billions,\u201d he said.\n\nNvidia, co-founded by Huang in 1993, got its start as a provider of graphics cards for computer gamers. Its profile blew up in the last two years, when its technology proved adept at handling heavy AI workloads. The company\u2019s H100 accelerators have become legendary in the tech world, with customers scrambling to get their hands on as many as possible.\n\nCompanies such as Amazon.com Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google are Nvidia\u2019s largest customers, accounting for nearly 40% of its revenue, as they rush to invest in hardware for AI computing.\n\nIn the fiscal fourth quarter, which ended Jan 28, Nvidia\u2019s revenue more than tripled to $22.1 billion. Profit excluding certain items was $5.16 a share. Analysts had predicted sales of about $20.4 billion and earnings of $4.60 a share. Underscoring the magnitude of its recent growth streak: As recently as 2021, Nvidia didn\u2019t generate that much revenue in an entire year.\n\nNvidia\u2019s data center division, now by far its largest source of sales, generated $18.4 billion of revenue, up 409% from the same period a year earlier. Gaming chips provided $2.87 billion of sales.\n\nNvidia is now working to spread its AI technology beyond the big data-center companies. Huang, 61, has traveled the globe arguing that governments and corporations need their own AI systems \u2014 both to protect their data and gain a competitive advantage.\n\nNvidia announced a deal with Cisco Systems Inc. earlier this month that gives it a new distribution channel. As part of that deal, Cisco, the world\u2019s biggest provider of networking gear, will help sell complete AI systems to companies.\n\nRead More: Nvidia, Cisco to Help Companies Build In-House AI Computing\n\nBut Nvidia faces risks, including mounting competition and a push by some customers to develop their own AI chips.\n\nAMD recently began selling a line of accelerators called the MI300. It expects to get revenue of $3.5 billion from that product this year, up from an earlier projection of $2 billion. Nvidia isn\u2019t standing still, though. Analysts expect the company to soon unveil more powerful accelerators.\n\nNvidia also has had to navigate new export rules for chips headed to China, the largest market for semiconductors. The company has scaled down the capabilities of its products in order to continue to sell to that region, which in the past has accounted for a quarter of revenue. Three months ago, Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress told analysts that the company\u2019s projections would have been higher if it weren\u2019t for the China rules.\n\nIn terms of data center revenue, China accounted for a mid-single-digit percentage in the fourth quarter. \u201cWe expect it to stay in a similar range in the first quarter,\u201d Kress said Wednesday.\n\nThe company has begun sending samples of new chips that are compliant with restrictions to Chinese customers, Huang said. That should help business pick up again.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to do our best to compete in that marketplace and succeed in the marketplace,\u201d Huang said.\n\n(Updates with comments from CEO starting in 10th paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Bad Movie Dubbing Led to the Fake Biden Campaign Robocalls Gene Therapy Makers Struggle to Find Patients for Miracle Cures US Citizens Become Collateral Damage in Global Sanctions Fight Pursuing \u2018American Dynamism,\u2019 Andreessen Horowitz Ups Its Game in DC The Dangers of Relying on the US to Power the Global Economy\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-surges-ai-sales-boom-222822819.html", "symbols": ["A1MD34.SA", "AMD.BE", "AMD.DU", "AMD.F", "AMD.HM", "AMD.MU", "AMD.MX", "AMD.NEO", "AMD.STU", "AMD.US", "AMD.XETRA", "AMD0.F", "NVD.BE", "NVD.DU", "NVD.F", "NVD.HA", "NVD.HM", "NVD.MU", "NVD.STU", "NVD.XETRA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.996, "neg": 0.032, "neu": 0.875, "pos": 0.093}}, {"date": "2024-02-21T23:32:00+00:00", "title": "NVIDIA Earnings: Another Beat Delivered", "content": "Investor-favorite NVIDIA NVDA has just unveiled Q4 and fiscal year 2024 results, undoubtedly representing the most highly-awaited release of the current earnings cycle.\n\nThe release has wrapped up the Q4 reporting cycle for the \u2018Mag 7\u2019, whose performance as a group has been remarkable amid the AI frenzy.\n\nLet\u2019s take a quick look at what the titan delivered.\n\nNVIDIA Q4\n\nThe company delivered Q4 revenue of a record $22.1 billion, up 27% sequentially and a sizable 409% on a year-over-year basis.

Needless to say, the company enjoyed a fantastic FY24, and the share performance has reflected that vividly, up 250% over the last year.\n\nFY24 Data Center sales surged 217% to a record $47.5 billion, whereas full-year Gaming revenue climbed 15% to $10.4 billion.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAnother robust quarter from NVIDIA NVDA has hit the tape, with scorching-hot Data Center demand and an improving gaming industry providing meaningful tailwinds. The company provided guidance for its 2025 Q1, expecting revenue of roughly $24.0 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The leader of the A.I.-based tech stocks that became known as the Magnificent 7 roughly a year ago has only gotten stronger in 2024 than last year \u2014 at least until the last couple trading days. A slight level of trepidation began to creep in; would this great graphics chips company be able to continue to bring awe to Wall Street?\r\n\r\nKeep in mind we happen to be at a time in the U.S. economy of continued uncertainty, as fleshed out in the Fed minutes from the latest FOMC meeting on January 30-31 (more on this later). NVIDIA shares had grown nearly +250% over the past year, and only started selling off somewhat as this earnings report grew nearer. To further complicate things, the \u201cwhisper number\u201d on the Street was undoubtedly higher than consensus expectations \u2014 meaning even a solid beat may not be enough to quench stock buyers\u2019 thirst upon the Q4 release.\r\n\r\nTypically, NVIDIA beat estimates on both top and bottom lines, seemingly without breaking a sweat. Earnings of $5.16 per share \u2014 representing an eye-popping +769% year-over-year growth \u2014 on $22.1 billion in quarterly sales easily surpassed the $4.55 per share and $20.31 billion in the Zacks consensus, respectively. Its all-important Data Center segment grew +38% year over year to $18.4 billion, nearly a billion and a half dollars more than analysts were expecting. And this was without full participation of its China business, which continued to be hampered by U.S. licensing restrictions. Its Auto segment also beat estimates to $281 million in the quarter.\r\n\r\nFiscal Q1 revenue guidance was also impressive: $24 billion compared to the $21.5 billion analysts had been looking for. We don\u2019t know exactly what the \u201cwhisper numbers\u201d were for NVIDIA in the quarter, but apparently they had not been met: immediately upon the report\u2019s release, shares fell another -3% on the news, after shedding nearly -8% from all-times highs registered a week ago. Yet in just the past few minutes, NVIDIA\u2019s fortunes have changed \u2014 shares are now +8% in today\u2019s after-market, and are up for related companies like Super Micro Computer SMCI and Advanced Micro Devices AMD, as well.\r\n\r\nElsewhere, upstart EV maker Rivian RIVN posted slight beats on both top and bottom lines compared with Zacks consenses, but forecast a lower total number of vehicles expected to be made in 2024: 57K, roughly the same as the company produced in 2023, below the 66K analysts following the company were expecting. Shares are now down -13.7% in late trading, adding to the already precipitous -27% drop year to date.\r\n\r\nEtsy ETSY shares are also down, nearly -3% at this hour, as the specialty e-commerce platform posted a big miss on Q4 earnings \u2014 62 cents per share versus 78 cents expected \u2014 while outperforming on the top line, with revenues of $842 million from $827.4 million in the Zacks consensus. Etsy also guided to a top-line next quarter anticipated to be the low point of 2024, with a pickup expected later in the year.\r\n\r\nFinally, minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) were released at 2pm ET today, depicting a monetary body ahead of the market when it came to apprehension about the risks of a heating-up economy. The minutes showed the Fed already ruminating upside inflation possibilities at its two-day meeting at the end of last month, and as a group appeared in no hurry to begin cutting interest rates. Certainly not at its March 19-20 meeting; the next FOMC deliberation doesn\u2019t happen until April 30-May 1st. By then we should have a clearer look at how the economy is clicking along, or whether it may then be in need of a rate cut.\r\n\r\nQuestions or comments about this article and/or author?

The company also posted adjusted earnings per share of $5.16 versus an expected $4.64 per share.\n\nAntoine Chkaiban, New Street Research Technology Infrastructure Analyst, and Dan Morgan, Synovus Trust Senior Portfolio Manager, joins Yahoo Finance to discuss the results.\n\nChkaiban elaborates on the possibilities for Nvidia in the future, along with AI chip making as a whole: \"Global spending on data center AI chips tripled in 2023 from $15 billion to $45 billion and is now set to double again to $90 billion in 2024. And if we look out a few years, well late last year, Lisa Su CEO of AMD (AMD) pitched a target addressable market for data center AI chips of $400 billion in 2027. So now we just need to think about the future along two axis. Either it materializes in a healthy and sustainable way or we fall short of this prediction, with disappointments, over investments, and lower returns.\"\n\nSpeaking to Nvidia's dominance in the space, against their competition, Morgan says: \"I think we have to think of Nvidia as first to market in AI. They have been talking on their conference calls and their product calls for over five years about the fact that they are dominant in the space. And then it came to fruition about a year ago, on this quarter, when they had the big blowout quarter.\" He continues by mentioning one the reasons why Nvidia is ahead of competition: \"The average AI chip that Nvidia sells, we don't know the exact price, some of them are like $20,000 or $30,000 apiece. So you kind of wonder if like an AMD who's kind of known as being a lower-priced chipmaker, especially in the CPU area against Intel (INTC), or let's say the data service space, would they come to try to introduce a cheaper chip that maybe people would be willing to go with.\"\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Nicholas Jacobino", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/video/nvidias-q4-earnings-set-stage-224044436.html", "symbols": ["0LCV.LSE", "0QZD.LSE", "0YXG.LSE", "1YD.BE", "1YD.DU", "1YD.F", "1YD.HA", "1YD.HM", "1YD.MU", "1YD.STU", "1YD.XETRA", "2330.TW", "A1MD34.SA", "AMD.BE", "AMD.DU", "AMD.F", "AMD.HM", "AMD.MU", "AMD.MX", "AMD.NEO"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.923, "neg": 0.014, "neu": 0.929, "pos": 0.057}}, {"date": "2024-02-21T22:40:10+00:00", "title": "Nvidia (NVDA) Tops Q4 Earnings and Revenue Estimates", "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) came out with quarterly earnings of $5.16 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.55 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.88 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 13.41%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence would post earnings of $3.36 per share when it actually produced earnings of $4.02, delivering a surprise of 19.64%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nNvidia , which belongs to the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, posted revenues of $22.1 billion for the quarter ended January 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8.82%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $6.05 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nNvidia shares have added about 40.2% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 4.3%.\n\nWhat's Next for Nvidia?\n\nWhile Nvidia has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nStory continues\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Nvidia: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $4.78 on $21.48 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $20.43 on $92.21 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Semiconductor - General is currently in the top 41% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nAnother stock from the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector, ON24 (ONTF), has yet to report results for the quarter ended December 2023. The results are expected to be released on February 22.\n\nThis webcasting and video communications services provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.02 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +150%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nON24's revenues are expected to be $37.29 million, down 19.9% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

We did hear from other companies, too. Here with the latest results, we've got team coverage from Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian, Ines Ferre, and Josh Schafer. Pras, let's start with you.\n\nPRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah. Thanks, Julie. I'm watching shares of Lucid Group here, lower in after-hours trading. The EV maker missed revenue expectations by more than $20 million in the fourth quarter. On the bottom line, the company reported an adjusted loss of $0.29 per share. For the full year 2024, Lucid setting a production target of 9,000 vehicles. That goal is slightly higher than the 8,400 produced last year.\n\nLucid had a tough start to 2024. Shares hit an all time low last month as weakening demand for EVs pushed bigger names like Tesla to slash prices. Now over to Ines Ferre for the latest in the energy space.\n\nStory continues\n\nINES FERRE: Yeah. That's right, Pras. And taking a look at Apache, that stock is down more than 2% after a missed for adjusted earnings for the company's fourth quarter, with adjusted earnings coming in at $1.15 per share. The Street was looking for $1.33. The company highlighting increased total company oil production by 8% year-over-year. Also, highlighting strong Permian Basin execution and well performance for its 2024 outlook. It's looking at oil growth of approximately 8% year-over-year.\n\nMoving on to Marathon Oil. Its fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share beat estimates with those coming in at $0.69 per share. The Street was looking for $0.65 a share. Revenue came in line with what Wall Street was expecting with a $1.69 billion. Net sales volume up 20% for the quarter year-over-year, and oil production up 14% year-over-year. We've seen a lot of that with oil companies last year.\n\nAnd now turning it over to Josh Schafer with a look at the after-hours reaction to Nvidia's latest quarterly results. Josh.\n\nJOSH SCHAFER: Yeah, Ines. I've been looking at how the markets are reacting to Nvidia's earnings, given the company's meteoric rise and its role in the AI-infused stock rally. Many were sort of nervous coming to this report and wondering how the broader markets would react. We're probably going to have to wait until tomorrow to get a full sense of that.\n\nBut I do have some of the after-hours action with us right now. And we're looking at semiconductors chip stocks here. You can see Nvidia's up about 7% right now, been rising a little bit through the afternoon here. But interesting to see some of the other companies that have sort of traded with Nvidia on this AI rally. Taking AMD up about 4%. And then when you take a look at some of the other stocks here, Arm, we know recently caught a bid, including an investment from Nvidia that caught investor attention. That stock is up about 5% after hours right now.\n\nAnd this is, again, our semiconductor board. And I want to just take a look at the AI board. That board is a little bit different. It includes some stocks that don't necessarily make chips but are sort of included in that AI trade. And you can see within that, when you take a look at the AI trade overall, you're seeing some pretty significant moves right now.\n\nSupermicro Computers, which has been on a pretty crazy rally, if I reach over here and take a look at that, you can see that stock had been rallying significantly over the last month, kind of came down as people got worried about Nvidia's earnings, what were people going to say about AI, what was Nvidia going to tell us. We'll take a look at that, it's rallying 8% after hours.\n\nA company like C3 AI has been a popular play, just look at its ticker. That stock up 3% after hours. Also looking at SoundHound. This company also recently was announced that Nvidia had been investing in it. The stock popped on that news then had traded back down, up about 5% after hours right now. So guys, we're seeing some movement across the market in the green off these Nvidia earnings.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Exciting stuff. Thanks so much, Josh.

Fourth-quarter revenue beat forecasts and the first-quarter outlook also exceeded analysts' expectations. Its shares rose 7% after the bell on Wednesday, but trading was extremely volatile.\n\nThe recovery in Chinese stocks from recent five-year lows, meanwhile, continues. The Shanghai Composite and CSI 300 index of blue chip shares both gained around 1% and chalked up their longest winning streaks in over a year.\n\nAnother up day on Thursday will seal their best runs since July 2020. The CSI 300 is now in the green for the year and the Shanghai Composite is creeping into positive territory.\n\nWhile investors have responded favorably to Beijing's efforts to prop up the market, inject liquidity into the banking system and boost economic activity, how long that positivity lasts is an open question.\n\nThe latest market measure, reported by Bloomberg on Wednesday, is a ban on major institutional investors reducing equity holdings at the open and close of each trading day.\n\nJapan's Nikkei, meanwhile, continues to pause for breath at its recent lofty 34-year heights just below 39,000 points, as dollar/yen consolidates around the 150.00 level.\n\nStory continues\n\nJapan's purchasing managers index reports on Thursday could reveal whether the economy is any closer to exiting recession.

This is amid the broader indices such as the Nasdaq making a brief pullback. Some analysts expect that the rally for tech stocks in general will continue, as the decline was primarily chalked up to a decline in the stock prices of companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and some otters in the Majestic Seven.\n\nThe robotics stocks in this article are powerful names, and I believe that they will continue to deliver strong gains to investors. Those who buy in early will reap the rewards. Investing a substantial amount in these companies could lead to seven-figure returns later on, and the growth potential of these companies is enormous.\n\nSo, here are some of the best companies for investors to scoop up this month.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIntuitive Surgical (ISRG) A sign with the Intuitive Surgical logo standing outside of a company office. ISRG stock.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nIntuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) is one of my favorite robotics stocks for investors wanting to dip their toes into the robotics healthcare market.\n\nISRG stock posted some strong results last quarter, and I believe that the best is yet to come for the company. For the fourth quarter of 2023, ISRG reported a 6% increase in systems revenue to approximately $480 million compared to the same quarter in 2022. Full-year 2023 systems revenue was approximately $1.68 billion, consistent with 2022. The company also increased the number of da Vinci surgical systems placed in 2023 to 1,370, up from 1,264 in 2022.\n\nLooking ahead to 2024, ISRG anticipates a 13% to 16% increase in worldwide da Vinci procedures. The consensus among analysts is a \u201cmoderate buy,\u201d with 16 buy ratings and 4 hold ratings.\n\nISRG looks set to continue it dominance in the robotic surgery industry, and this year and the next may continue that strength moving forward.\n\nSarcos Technology and Robotics (STRC) Man holding stacks of money. Unknown Millionaire-Maker cryptos. Strong Buy Stocks. Millionaire-maker quantum computing stocks\n\nSource: Epic Cure / Shutterstock\n\nSarcos Technology and Robotics (NASDAQ:STRC) is a company focused on the development of robotics and microelectromechanical systems.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor 2024, the company anticipates ending the year with around $39 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. STRC also expects net cash usage to average about $1.6 million per month in 2024, potentially decreasing further with additional revenue from customer purchases.\n\nThis comes after securing a notable $13.8 million, four-year development contract with the U.S. Air Force to advance AI and ML software.\n\nAlthough STRC is pre-earnings and only recorded $11.52 million in revenues, Stephen Volkmann, an analyst at Jeffries,updated his price target for the company to $1.15 in August last year, down from $4.25. However, this downgrade still implies a 109.85% upside for the company, which is expected to be reached within twelve months.\n\nThese early-stage companies like STRC may offer the biggest upsides for investors as they are the most risky, all else being equal. But sometimes, owning a few or even fractional shares in these moonshoots can potentially lead to seven-figure returns.\n\nSmith & Nephew (SNN) A concept image of robot hands with stock information in between them. Robotics stocks to buy\n\nSource: Blue Planet Studio / Shutterstock\n\nAlthough better known for its contributions to orthopedic reconstruction and advanced wound management, Smith & Nephew (NYSE:SNN) also ventures into robotics with its Navio surgical system. The Navio system is designed for both partial and total knee replacement procedures.\n\nIn the first half of 2023, the company saw revenue rise to $2,734 million, marking a 7.3% increase on an underlying basis. The increase was supported by strong performance in Sports Medicine & ENT and Advanced Wound Management.\n\nLooking ahead, the company expects to generate more than $200 million in annual savings by 2025 as part of its broader strategy to enhance productivity and drive growth across its segments\u200b.\n\nThe robotic surgery market is still in its infancy and is decentralized, with different robots specializing and being authorized for use in different surgeries. The growth potential of robotics can then be expected to be unlocked incrementally, and SNN is positioned well for its niche use case. This then makes it one of those robotics stocks to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

A live webcast (listen-only mode) of the conference call will be accessible at NVIDIA\u2019s investor relations website, https://investor.nvidia.com. The webcast will be recorded and available for replay until NVIDIA\u2019s conference call to discuss its financial results for its first quarter of fiscal 2025.\n\nNon-GAAP Measures\r\nTo supplement NVIDIA\u2019s condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP other income (expense), net, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, and free cash flow. For NVIDIA\u2019s investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude acquisition termination costs, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, IP-related costs, other, gains and losses from non-affiliated investments, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, and the associated tax impact of these items where applicable. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less both purchases related to property and equipment and intangible assets and principal payments on property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user\u2019s overall understanding of the company\u2019s historical financial performance. The presentation of the company\u2019s non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company\u2019s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the company\u2019s non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.\n\nAbout NVIDIA\r\nSince its founding in 1993, NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a pioneer in accelerated computing.

The chip designer's shares fell, adding to the previous day's decline of more than 4%.\n\nThe company's fourth-quarter revenue is expected to more than triple from the previous quarter's level on robust demand for its chips that dominate the market for artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nNvidia shares have soared nearly 40% this year, making it the biggest gainer on the S&P 500 after a leap of almost 240% in 2023. Analysts have cautioned that its lofty valuation could make the stock vulnerable to a sharp pullback if the company delivers anything short of a blowout report. This in turn could dampen enthusiasm over other AI-related stocks that have helped power the market rally off its October 2022 low.\n\n\"It's been driven by excitement and enthusiasm around AI and of course the AI darling in the room is Nvidia,\" said Jason Ware, chief investment officer at Albion Financial Group in Salt Lake City, Utah.\n\n\"Markets are looking at Nvidia with a little bit of anxiety, maybe, given that we have a market that's done so well and maybe in order to keep it going short term we need to see a good report from the leader in the space and that leader is Nvidia.\"\n\nUnofficially, the S&P 500 climbed 0.13% to end the session at 4,981.82 points.

If you would like to skip our discussion on the US economy, you can go to the 5 States With the Best Unemployment Benefits in 2024.\n\nThe economic outlook for the United States remains uncertain, with the producer price index rising by 0.3% in January. This marked the most significant increase since August and was higher than the 0.1% forecast. Furthermore, the core producer price index, excluding food and energy, also experienced a higher-than-expected rise of 0.5%. While manufacturing activity, particularly in the production of high-tech goods like semiconductors, has seen a 23% YoY increase, economists at Morgan Stanley project a first-quarter GDP growth rate of 2%. However, they expect a decline in fourth-quarter GDP growth from 3.3% to 2.1%.\n\nConsumer sentiments, reflected in the University of Michigan consumer survey, indicate a slight rise above January levels, suggesting confidence in the economy. This sentiment persists despite the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for all items showing an increase for the 12 months ending January. The core CPI, excluding the food and energy components, experienced a 0.4% rise in January, keeping its year-over-year increase at 3.9%, consistent with the figures from December.\n\nThe forecast had predicted a 0.3% and a 3.7% rise, respectively. Shelter costs, representing roughly one-third of the CPI calculation, were a significant driver of the overall increase. The index for the shelter category increased by 0.6% for the month. On an annual basis, shelter costs saw a 6% increase. Similarly, the food index observed a 2.6% YoY increase in January, with month-on-month values rising by 0.4%. While the annual inflation rate is above the 2% benchmark set by the Federal Reserve, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) showed a 2.9% YoY growth in December.\n\nThere is an expectation that a potential recession might be deeper and stronger than initially forecasted, particularly with slowing wage growth rates. Keeping these circumstances in mind, there is increased focus on unemployment statistics, as individuals may suffer if employment lags. There are varying levels of concern amongst the states depending on the unemployment rates in different regions. In January, the unemployment rate in the US remained steady at 3.7% for the third consecutive month, with little change in the number of unemployed people, standing at 6.1 million. States with the lowest unemployment rates, such as Maryland and North Dakota, may be less worried, while states with the highest unemployment rates, like Nevada and the District of Columbia, are likely to experience a more significant impact. Major corporations such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and \u00a0Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) have a key role to play in providing employment to a considerable number of people in the US. Interestingly, the technology sector made up 40% of the companies on the list of the best employers in 2023; in fact, six of the top ten employers were IT companies, highlighting the sector's leadership in offering attractive work environments.\n\nStory continues\n\nHere's what Madison Investments said about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q4 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) was positive during the quarter but had a more modest gain in the fourth quarter following a strong third quarter and as a result, lagged the Technology sector more broadly. Alphabet\u2019s third quarter included solid Search and You Tube results while Cloud growth was a bit softer, growing at 22% year-over-year. Google continues to incorporate AI in its core search businesses. It has been rolled out to a wide number of users across multiple geographies. We will continue to watch how Google adapts AI in its businesses and monitor cloud growth.\u201d 15 States With the Best Unemployment Benefits in 2024\n\nImage by Steve Buissinne from Pixabay\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo shortlist the 15 states with the best unemployment benefits in 2024, we made use of three weighted metrics, namely the cost of living index (weight of 0.3), the average weekly benefit weight of 0.4), and the number of weeks these benefits extend (weight of 0.3). We then ranked the best states for unemployment benefits on all three of these metrics. We then calculated a weighted average of states' rankings on these three metrics and adjusted the final rankings based on the weighted-average rankings. The states with the best unemployment benefits in 2024 have been ranked in descending order of rankings.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

The chipmaker's results and outlook could hinder or further fuel this year's rally in AI-related stocks.\n\nThe bulk of Fed policymakers were concerned about the risks of cutting rates too soon, with broad uncertainty about how long borrowing costs should remain at their current level, minutes of the Jan. 30-31 session showed.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which reflects interest rate expectations, rose 4.3 basis points to 4.655%, while MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.47%.\n\n\"I don't think the minutes really told us anything new. The markets have basically already done the Fed's work for them in terms of pricing out chances of a March rate cut and for a bunch of cuts down the road,\" said Kim Rupert, managing director of global fixed income at Action Economics in San Francisco.\n\nPolicymakers are concerned that the economy is going to limit further disinflationary trends, or at least has the potential to see progress on inflation stall out, she said.\n\n\"There's some very small risk of a hike that's been priced in just because of the hotter-than-expected inflation numbers\" last week, Rupert said.\n\nA slim majority of economists polled by Reuters now expects the Fed to start cutting rates in June, farther out than market expectations last month of a first cut in March.\n\nMarkets now expect 91.5 basis points (bps) of cuts from the Fed this year, closer to the U.S. central bank's own projection of 75 bps of easing - or half the 150 bps of cuts priced in by traders at the start of the year.\n\nStory continues\n\nStocks fell in Europe as shares in HSBC tumbled 8.4% in its biggest single-day decline since April 2020, after a shock $3 billion charge on its stake in a Chinese bank took the shine off record annual profit at the region's largest bank.\n\nThe pan-European STOXX 600 index closed down 0.17%.\n\nBut the day's focus is on Nvidia, whose shares have jumped 40% so far this year as of Tuesday's close.\n\nIf Nvidia only marginally meets or beats expectations the company will suffer dramatically as investors seek an excuse to pull back, at least in Big Tech, said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial in Troy, Michigan. \"Nvidia is going to have to absolutely crush earnings and crush earnings expectations and probably deliver an above-expectations outlook for that stock to continue to move higher,\" he said.\n\n\"If Nvidia's report is lackluster and kicks off a decline in big tech or the overall S&P 500 by 5%-10%, I wouldn't change my outlook.

Some investors may be contemplating on taking profits while others may be eying their entry point and wondering if the fall to under $700 a share is just a brief pause before Nvidia\u2019s stock rips higher. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nPrice Target & Broker Recommendations\n\nAwaiting the analysis of Nvidia\u2019s Q4 results this evening investors may be scouring through analyst price targets. Based on the short-term price targets offered by 38 analysts, the Average Zacks Price Target of $724.19 a share currently implies 7% upside with NVDA shares down roughly -3% to around $674 a share in this morning's trading session.\n\nNotably, 35 out of 40 brokerage firms covering Nvidia\u2019s stock and offering data to Zacks have a strong buy rating at the moment with 2 at a buy and 3 at a hold. This gives Nvidia a very favorable ABR (average broker recommendation) of 1.20 on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell). Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nQ4 Expectations & Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nTaking a last look at Nvidia\u2019s Q4 projections before results this evening the Zacks Consensus for earnings is at $4.55 per share which would represent 417% growth from $0.88 per share in the comparative quarter. Fourth quarter sales are projected to increase 235% to $20.31 billion.\n\nOverall, Nvidia is expected to round out its fiscal 2024 with annual earnings climbing 270% to $12.36 per share and total sales increasing 119% to $59.13 billion. More importantly, the trend of earnings estimate revisions has been positive with FY24 EPS estimates slightly up over the last 60 days while FY25 EPS estimates have risen 3%.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nWhile investors may be on edge for Nvidia\u2019s Q4 results the number of brokers recommending its stock is very reassuring. To that point, Nvidia\u2019s stock currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) attributed to rising earnings estimate revisions and a post-earnings rally wouldn\u2019t be surprising if the chip giant can reach or exceed its lofty Q4 expectations.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Still, government officials and scientists are concerned that the advent of quantum computers, advanced machines that tap in to the properties of subatomic particles, could suddenly and dramatically weaken those protections.\n\nLate last year, a Reuters investigation explored how the United States and China are racing to prepare for that moment, dubbed \u201cQ-Day,\u201d both by pouring money into quantum research and by investing in new encryption standards known as post-quantum cryptography.\n\nWashington and Beijing have traded allegations of intercepting massive amounts of encrypted data in preparation for Q-Day, an approach sometimes dubbed \u201ccatch now, crack later.\u201d\n\nIBM executive Ana Paula Assis has warned that quantum computing could cause a \u201ccybersecurity armageddon.\u201d\n\n04:30 PM GMT\n\nPrivate spacecraft reaches moon\n\nA moon lander built by Houston-based company Intuitive Machines reached lunar orbit today, headed for an attempt at the first US touchdown on Earth\u2019s nearest celestial neighbor in more than 50 years, and the first ever by a private spacecraft.\n\nThe six-legged Nova-C lander, dubbed Odysseus, entered a circular orbit 57 miles above the lunar surface after firing its main rocket thruster for nearly seven minutes in an orbital insertion maneuver, the company said in an online statement.\n\nAssuming all goes according to plan, the robot spacecraft is expected to gradually lower its orbit over the next 24 hours and land at crater Malapert A near the moon\u2019s south pole 10:49pm (UK time) on Thursday, carrying a suite of NASA science instruments and technology demonstrations.\n\nOdysseus was launched six days ago, on February 15, atop a Falcon 9 rocket built and flown by Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX from NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida.\n\nIt would mark the first \u201csoft landing\u201d on the moon ever by a commercially manufactured and operated vehicle.

Will it see more competition, and could this eat away at revenues in the future? If yes, then we could see a lot of volatility for markets in the coming days.\n\nBut, if Nvidia signals that the future is rosy, then we could expect another leg higher in the recent rally.

Hannah Boland reports:\n\nAn interim review of the Cabenuva treatment revealed the jab is better at suppressing HIV for patients who struggle to take a pill every day.\n\nThis could include patients who do not have stable insurance policies or those who worry that taking pills could disclose the existence of their condition.\n\nThe NHS says people diagnosed with HIV typically take between one and four pills a day.\n\nHowever, the Cabenuva treatment works through two-monthly injections and helps make the level of HIV in the blood undetectable, which significantly reduces the risk of transmitting the infection through sex. It is available in the UK on the NHS.\n\nDr Kimberly Smith,\u00a0the head of research and development at GSK-controlled ViiV Healthcare, said: \u201cThe interim data indicating the superiority of long-acting therapy compared to daily oral therapy in individuals who have difficulty taking pills for HIV every day is a remarkable outcome.\n\n\u201cOptimising therapy for all people living with HIV, including those with adherence challenges, is critical to the effort to end the HIV epidemic.\u201d\n\nIt comes as GSK pushes ahead with plans to bolster its long-acting HIV drug portfolio.\n\nIt expects around 40pc of its HIV business to come from long-acting therapies within the next four or five years.\n\nViiv Healthcare, which Pfizer also has a minority stake in, is currently working on making it possible for people to inject their treatments at home so that they do not have to visit clinics every month.\n\nIt said last year it was planning to start clinic trials for a self-administered injection in 2026.\n\nIt is also working on a potential cure for HIV that will essentially wake up the virus within people\u2019s immune cells and then allow them to be targeted.

The shares fell as much as much as 6.4pc in morning trading but are now down by just 0.93pc. Matt Oliver has more on the news that caused City jitters:\n\nThe FTSE 100 company on Wednesday said core earnings tumbled from 2022\u2019s record $34bn (\u00a327bn) to $17bn last year, as the thermal coal boom that followed Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine petered out.\n\nAt the same time, Glencore\u2019s net debts have ballooned from $75m to nearly $5bn following its takeover of the coal division of Teck Resources last year.\n\nGary Nagle, the miner\u2019s chief executive, said the company was now \u201cmanaging the balance sheet\u201d and would scale back returns to shareholders, cutting the full-year dividend from $6.5bn to $1.6bn.\n\nFor the first time in years, the company is also not launching any share buybacks. It follows the bumper returns of $7.1bn pledged to investors in 2023, however.\n\nThe slowdown comes after energy and commodity prices became less volatile than in the immediate aftermath of the Ukraine war\u2019s outbreak, while Glencore\u2019s deal to buy Teck\u2019s steelmaking coal business is placing extra pressure on the company\u2019s finances.\n\nBut Mr Nagle insisted that current market prices meant the business was expected to be \u00a0\u201chighly cash generative\u201d in 2024, which \u201caugurs well\u201d for future dividend payouts and buybacks\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cAs the world moves towards a low-carbon economy, we remain focused on supporting the energy needs of today whilst investing in our transition commodities portfolio.\u201d\n\nIt comes as Glencore is preparing to offer shareholders a choice on whether to demerge its consolidated coal assets into a separate business, following the Teck deal.\n\nThe company and Nagle have also been criticised by the activist investor Bluebell Capital, which claimed that the thermal coal and steelmaking coal businesses would only have limited compatibility.

She said:\n\nEconomic growth is still likely to remain sluggish, so today\u2019s data is unlikely to factor into the Bank of England\u2019s decision on when to cut rates.\n\nHowever, the question about tax cuts is now getting interesting.\n\nThe surplus meant that the Government has borrowed \u00a39.2bn less than the OBR had forecast it would by this point in the financial year, handing Chancellor Jeremy Hunt potential room for giveaways in his Budget.\n\nThe pound was flat against the dollar at $1.26 and was also little changed against the euro at 85p.\n\n02:35 PM GMT\n\nUS markets slump amid worries for AI rally\n\nWall Street\u2019s main indexes opened lower \u00a0ahead of chip designer Nvidia\u2019s crucial earnings report that could potentially hinder or further fuel this year\u2019s AI-led rally.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 80.14 points, or 0.2pc, at the open to 38,483.66.\n\nThe S&P 500 opened lower by 12.48 points, or 0.3pc, at 4,963.03, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 98.66 points, or 0.6pc, to 15,532.12 at the opening bell.\n\n02:19 PM GMT\n\nSweden hits out at Greta Thunberg\u2019s \u2018flight shaming\u2019 movement\n\nSweden\u2019s government has hit out at the country\u2019s net zero \u201cflight shaming\u201d movement as it announced a \u00a376m cash injection for the airline industry.\n\nOur economics reporter Melissa Lawford has the details:\n\nInfrastructure minister Andreas Carlson said the government would invest more than one billion kronor to support carriers as they struggle to recover from the pandemic, high energy prices and the economic toll from Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine.\n\nMr Carlson told reporters: \u201cThere are few reasons to feel flight shame and as the [green] transition increases there will be even fewer.\u201d\n\nHis words refuted the Swedish concept of \u201cflygskam\u201d.

It was last trading just below $82.\n\nRAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said:\n\nNews that fuel prices have bottomed out and are now on the rise again is bad news for drivers, and possibly the economy and future inflation rates, too.\n\nWhile we\u2019re not expecting prices to shoot up dramatically, it appears that oil is trading up, which in the absence of a stronger pound, means wholesale fuel costs more for retailers to buy in. The result is higher prices at the pump and more expense for the every-day driver.\n\nThe Red Sea attacks by Houthi rebels, which are forcing tankers to avoid the Suez Canal and instead go round South Africa\u2019s Cape of Good Hope, are clearly playing their part, but so have global refinery maintenance closures, the start of America\u2019s driving season and UK retailers buying more fuel stocks ahead of the Budget to protect against a possible fuel duty hike by the Chancellor.\n\n11:49 AM GMT\n\nGermany 'in difficult waters' as government slashes growth predictions\n\nThe German government has drastically cut back its growth forecast for Europe\u2019s largest economy as it battles the impact of high inflation and a likely recession.\n\nThe cabinet of chancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019s administration today approved its annual economic report, which expects the economy to grow by just 0.2pc this year, according to Reuters.\n\nIt is far less than previous predictions of 1.3pc and comes after Germany\u2019s economy shrank by 0.3pc last year.\n\nCentral bank the Bundesbank said it is \u201clikely\u201d that the country has fallen into a recession in the first three months of this year.\n\n\u201cThe German economy continues to find itself in difficult waters at the beginning of the year,\u201d said a draft of the report seen by Reuters.\n\nIt listed high inflation and a resulting loss of purchasing power among the challenges, as well as geopolitical crises and interest rate hikes.

The write-down of BoCom follows a similar pattern to what Standard Chartered did last quarter and while loan loss charges were better than expected, the Chinese commercial real estate sector continues to be weak.\n\n08:06 AM GMT\n\nUK markets open lower amid fading rate cut hopes\n\nThe FTSE 100 has begun the day lower following declines on Wall Street and on Asian markets.\n\nThe UK\u2019s blue chip index was down 0.4pc after the open to 7,686.83 while the midcap FTSE 250 was little changed at 19,110.67.\n\n07:56 AM GMT\n\nBorrowing boost won't give Hunt cash to splash, warn economists\n\nA record surplus in January and lower than expected borrowing do not mean Jeremy Hunt will be able to spend big in his Budget next month, economists have warned.\n\nRuth Gregory, deputy chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said:\n\nJanuary\u2019s public finances figures delivered some much-needed good news for the Chancellor in the lead-up to the Budget on March 6.\n\nBut we doubt this will pave the way for a big pre-election splash.\n\nWe think the Chancellor will be handed \u201cheadroom\u201d of just \u00a315bn (0.5pc of GDP), limiting his ability to unveil big unfunded tax cuts if he wishes to adhere to the fiscal rules.\n\nGora Suri, economist at PwC UK, added: \u201cWith the OBR\u2019s final forecast assumptions now locked in, Hunt is likely to have limited scope for tax cuts or additional spending compared to his predecessors.\n\n\u201cThe Chancellor may have more headroom than the OBR expected in November, due to falls in market expectations for interest rates and gilt yields, but lower tax revenues from a smaller cash economy may push headroom down.\u201d\n\n07:53 AM GMT\n\nHSBC suffers \u00a32.4bn hit from China property crisis\n\nHSBC reported a sharp slide in final quarter profits after a $3bn (\u00a32.4bn) writedown on its stake in a major Chinese bank.\n\nOur reporter Michael Bow has the details:\n\nThe bank\u2019s pre-tax profits for the three month period ending December 2023 fell 80pc from $5bn to $1bn after it took the $3bn charge on its stake in Bank of Communication (BoCom).\n\nThe UK-based lender has held a 19pc stake in the Shanghai-based lender since 2004. The stake is seen as strategically important for HSBC but has raised questions from analysts about its value.\n\nHSBC cited \u201crecent macroeconomic, policy and industry factors\u201d for the impairment but said it had no plans to sell the BoCom stake.\n\n\u201cBoCom remains a strong partner in China, and we remain focused on maximising the mutual value of our partnership. Our positive views on the medium and long-term structural growth opportunities in mainland China are unchanged,\u201d it said.\n\nThe devaluation of the Argentine peso also hit profits by $500m. Argentina is suffering\u00a0from hyperinflation due to the devaluation of the peso in December.\n\nThe $3bn writedown marred record annual profits for HSBC. HSBC revealed its China division suffered a $3bn blow at the end of last year - Lam Yik/Bloomberg\n\n07:51 AM GMT\n\nHunt could have \u00a321bn of extra headroom on Treasury books, say economists\n\nMichal Stelmach, senior economist at KPMG UK, said the public finances were \u201cflattered\u201d by the drop in grants and subsidies but said that the OBR would likely upgrade its outlook for the Treasury. He said:\n\nThe latest set of data suggests that borrowing could end 2023-24 at \u00a3114 billion.\n\nWe expect the OBR to upgrade its fiscal outlook on the back of a weaker expected path for interest rates, lower spending on inflation-linked debt, as well as a possible upward revision to their net migration assumptions, which are net positive for the public finances.\n\nThis could increase the headroom to meet the fiscal mandate to \u00a321bn, up from \u00a313bn at the Autumn Statement.\n\nThe policy choice lies between fiscal pragmatism and a stated desire to cut taxes.\n\nAccounting for the customary fuel duty freeze could leave the Chancellor with around \u00a314bn to play with.\n\nThis would be enough to afford a 2p cut to the basic rate of Income Tax, also benefitting the pensioners who could not take advantage of the recent reduction in the National Insurance contributions.\n\nHowever, it would inevitably come at a cost of a greater constrain on future policy options. Navigating this delicate balance will be a tricky task in an election year.\n\n07:48 AM GMT\n\nDebt interest bill falls by \u00a328.9bn\n\nGovernment spending rose by \u00a367.5bn in the first ten months of the financial year, hitting \u00a3944bn, but the picture could have been much worse.\n\nThe Treasury saved \u00a328.9bn over the period on debt interest payments as inflation fell back from 41-year highs experienced in October 2022.\n\nMeanwhile, the Government spent \u00a312.9bn less on subsidies, mainly because of the reduction in energy support costs.\n\n07:32 AM GMT\n\nEconomy is beginning to turn a corner, says minister\n\nAs the latest Government borrowing figures were published, Chief Secretary to the Treasury Laura Trott said:\n\nWe provided hundreds of billions to pay wages, support business and protect lives during Covid, and to pay half of people\u2019s energy bills after Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nBut we can\u2019t leave future generations to pick up the tab, which is why we have taken tough decisions to help reduce borrowing versus what the OBR expected in March.\n\nWhile we will not speculate over whether further reductions in tax will be affordable in the Budget, the\u00a0economy is beginning to turn a corner, with inflation down from over 11pc to 4pc.\n\n07:31 AM GMT\n\nGovernment debt hits 96.5pc of GDP\n\nWhile Government borrowing is much lower than expected so far this financial year, the Treasury\u2019s overall debt remains at its highest levels in six decades, when compared to the size of Britain\u2019s economy.\n\nPublic sector net debt excluding public sector banks was \u00a32.64 trillion at the end of January, which is equivalent to about 96.5pc of UK GDP.\n\nThat is 1.8 percentage points higher than in January last year and remains at levels last seen in the early 1960s.\n\nPublic sector net debt was \u00a32,646.5 billion at the end of January 2024 and was provisionally estimated at around 96.5% of the UK\u2019s annual gross domestic product. pic.twitter.com/TuZCHofmO8\n\n\u2014 Office for National Statistics (ONS) (@ONS) February 21, 2024\n\n07:27 AM GMT\n\nGovernment reduced spending amid falling interest payments, says ONS\n\nONS deputy director for public sector Jessica Barnaby said:\n\nJanuary\u2019s surplus is the largest in nominal terms since monthly records began in 1993, although borrowing in the year to January is only slightly lower than the same period last year.\n\nTax receipts are always higher in January than other months owing to self-assessed taxes, which often leads to a surplus.\n\nAlso, with recent reductions in the RPI rate, interest payable on government gilts and without last year\u2019s government support schemes, overall expenditure was down on this time last year, despite increased spending on public services and benefits.\n\nAs a proportion of gross domestic product, public sector debt is up on the year, and remains at levels last seen in the 1960s.\n\n07:17 AM GMT\n\nHunt handed \u00a39.2bn borrowing boost for Budget tax cuts\n\nJeremy Hunt has been handed a \u00a39.2bn borrowing boost as he seeks potential pre-election giveaways for his Budget next month.\n\nGovernment borrowing came in at \u00a396.6bn in the first ten months of the financial year, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).\n\nThis was lower than the official forecasts of spending by the OBR, which thought the Treasury would have borrowed \u00a3105.8bn by this point.\n\nThe extra headroom for the Chancellor comes as the public purse was boosted by a record surplus in January, which is traditionally a strong month as Britons file their tax returns.\n\nThe ONS recorded a \u00a316.7bn surplus last month in the public finances, which was more than double the surplus last year and the largest surplus since monthly records began in 1993 in nominal terms.\n\nHowever, it was still below economists\u2019 estimates of a surplus of \u00a318.4bn.\n\nPublic sector net borrowing excluding public sector banks was \u00a316.7 billion in surplus in January 2024.\r\n\r\nThis was more than double the surplus of January 2023 and the largest since monthly records began in 1993.\r\n\r\n\u27a1\ufe0f https://t.co/Hz0LLO7Kbipic.twitter.com/iHQOT14JoY\n\n\u2014 Office for National Statistics (ONS) (@ONS) February 21, 2024\n\n07:09 AM GMT\n\nGood morning\n\nThanks for joining me.

Shares of Intel were also down as much as 2.5% in intraday trading Wednesday.\n\nEven with this week\u2019s declines, Nvidia boasts a market capitalization of about $1.7 trillion. It has the third-highest weighting in the S&P 500, behind only Microsoft Corp. and Apple Inc., so a swing either way will add or erase billions of dollars in value for investors.\n\nThe stock is up about 35% in 2024, even with this week\u2019s slip. That\u2019s the biggest gain on the S&P 500 Index to start the year, and it builds on last year\u2019s 239% surge, also topping the benchmark gauge. Nvidia has added more than $400 billion in market value just this year.\n\nWall Street expects another banner quarter, with more than $20 billion in revenue, a jump of nearly 240% from a year earlier and the third straight period of triple-digit-percent gains, data compiled by Bloomberg show.

But in both cases, the shares eventually powered higher.\n\n\u201cThe stock always looks the most expensive right before they open their mouths,\u201d said Michael Sansoterra, chief investment officer at Silvant Capital Management, who sees further upward momentum given Nvidia\u2019s leadership in AI. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say if you\u2019re going to get paid on earnings day, but I don\u2019t think that drastically matters.\u201d\n\nWall Street is overwhelmingly bullish on the shares.

The change is set to go into effect before the market opens on Monday, Feb. 26.\n\n\"The index needs to stay relevant and reflect the higher end of US markets, and Amazon was a natural selection,\" Howard Silverblatt, S&P Dow Jones Indices senior index analyst, told Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nHe added: \"For the average investor it will mean that the index is more reflective of consumer selections at this point in time.\"\n\nThe swap of tech giant Amazon for Walgreens adds exposure to a variety of areas for the index. Amazon's wide range of industries including cloud computing, artificial intelligence, healthcare and e-commerce far exceeds the reach of the traditional pharmacy brand in Walgreens. This, Silverblatt, was crucial in influencing the switch.\n\n\"[Amazon is] developing and giving you exposure to a few other fields,\" Silverblatt said. \"But mostly you\u2019re dealing with the consumer, the retail sector, where the bulk of [Amazon] is right now. And that\u2019s a positive because the consumer is the biggest part of the economy.\"\n\nSilverblatt highlighted that unlike the S&P 500 which rebalances every quarter, the Dow Jones doesn't reshuffle the 30 companies within its index frequently. In the 120 year history of the Dow, there have only been 60 changes, per Silverblatt.\n\nOne reason a company can be swapped out of the index is if its share price deteriorates and becomes less relevant to the overall index. Walgreens has seen that over the last several years with shares down nearly 70% over the last five years, while Amazon is up more than 100% in that same time frame.\n\nWalgreen shares have notably slumped as more shoppers move to online options like Amazon. The struggles of pharmacies were most recently highlighted by Rite Aid's recent bankruptcy filing in October.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"We don\u2019t not like to change the members in there because of consistency, but at times it has to be done because as the economy changes, the index has to change,\" Silverblatt said.

Results and its outlook could determine equity sentiment for weeks to come as AI-related stocks have driven much of this year's rally.\n\n\"Nvidia is going to have to absolutely crush earnings and crush earnings expectations and probably deliver an above expectations outlook for that stock to continue to move higher,\" said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial in Troy, Michigan.\n\nIf Nvidia, up 40% so far this year as of Tuesday's close, only marginally meets or beats expectations, it will suffer dramatically as investors are looking for an excuse to pull back, at least in Big Tech, he said.\n\n\"If Nvidia's report is lackluster and kicks off a decline in big tech or the overall S&P 500 by 5%-10%, I wouldn't change my outlook. That would be healthy for the market,\" Saglimbene said.\n\nNvidia, the third-largest company by market cap in the S&P 500, was down about 2.1%. The company is expected to post more than a three-fold surge in fourth-quarter revenue on robust demand for its AI chips, which dominate the market.\n\nMSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe fell 0.30% to 745.92, while in Europe, the pan-regional STOXX 600 index slid 0.29%, pulled lower by HSBC.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.24%, the S&P 500 lost 0.28% and the Nasdaq Composite slid 0.66%.\n\nMinutes from the Federal Open Market Committee's policy meeting in January will not capture last week's data on inflation, which revealed enough of an uptick to prompt investors to rethink when the Fed might cut interest rates.\n\nA slim majority of economists polled by Reuters now expects the Fed to start cutting rates in June, farther out than market expectations last month of a first cut in March.\n\nMarkets now expect 91.5 basis points of cuts from the Fed this year, closer to the U.S. central bank's own projection of 75 bps of easing - or half the 150 bps of cuts priced in by traders at the start of the year.\n\nThe yield on benchmark U.S. 10-year notes fell 0.2 basis points to 4.273%. The two-year's yield, which typically moves in step with interest rate expectations, fell 0.6 basis points to 4.6061%.\n\nThe changing rates outlook has boosted the dollar and kept the yen, which is extremely sensitive to U.S. rates, near three-month lows.\n\nThe dollar index was down 0.01% at 104.03, with the euro up 0.0% at 1.0811. The dollar strengthened 0.09% at 150.12 against the Japanese yen.\n\nSterling shrugged off Britain's highest ever monthly budget surplus in January and traded flat on the day.\n\nMeanwhile, Chinese blue-chip stocks posted a 1.4% gain on the day, a day after the biggest reduction yet in the nation's benchmark mortgage rate as authorities stepped up efforts to support the property market.\n\n\"Regulators are cautious and taking a gradual approach, with the possibility of introducing further measures if needed,\" said Jian Shi Cortesi, investment director of Asia/China Growth Equities of GAM Investments.\n\n\"The market sentiment has improved slightly, but the sustainability relies more on improvements in economic activities and corporate earnings.\"\n\nIn commodities, U.S. crude gained 0.16% to $77.16 a barrel and Brent rose to $82.43 per barrel on the day.\n\nIron ore futures declined for a third consecutive session on Wednesday to their lowest in nearly four months.\n\nThe most-traded May iron ore on China's Dalian Commodity Exchange ended daytime trade 3.98% lower at 893 yuan ($124.29) per metric ton, the lowest close since Oct. 31, after a more than 5% drop the day before.\n\n(Reporting by Herbert Lash, additional reporting by Amanda Cooper in London, Ankur Banerjee in Singapore and Anisha Sircar in Bangalore; Editing by Shri Navaratnam, Ros Russell, Barbara Lewis, William Maclean)", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-markets-dollar-steady-stocks-160750134.html", "symbols": ["NVD.BE", "NVD.DU", "NVD.F", "NVD.HA", "NVD.HM", "NVD.MU", "NVD.STU", "NVD.XETRA", "NVDA.MX", "NVDA.NEO", "NVDA.US", "NVDC34.SA", "NVDG.F"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": -0.758, "neg": 0.061, "neu": 0.89, "pos": 0.05}}, {"date": "2024-02-21T15:57:54+00:00", "title": "Stock Market Today: Dow Jones, S&amp;P 500 Retreat; All Eyes On Nvidia As Palo Alto Plummets", "content": "The stock market today started the day negative with the Dow Jones posting a modest loss Wednesday.

One of the most conspicuous companies on Wall Street \u2014 NVIDIA NVDA, the leader of the so-called \u201cMagnificent 7\u201d stocks, +230% over the past year \u2014 reports Q4 earnings after today\u2019s closing bell. While this company had been priced for perfection, running up to fresh all-time highs one week ago, we\u2019ve seen traders pull back in the past couple days, including a -2% drop in today\u2019s pre-market.\n\nExpectations are still high for the graphics processing innovator, which has built itself up to the third-largest publicly traded corporation by market cap, behind just Apple AAPL and Microsoft MSFT. NVIDIA\u2019s ubiquity is by now well known: we wouldn\u2019t have video games, cryptocurrency, generative AI, etc. to the extent we currently understand them without NVIDIA supplying GPUs to these sub-industries. Earnings estimates are currently projected to have risen over +400% year over year.\n\nYesterday\u2019s -4.5% selloff was the biggest single-day drop for NVIDIA thus far in 2024. This serves a dual purpose for market participants ahead of this afternoon\u2019s report: a.) either NVIDIA posts a surprise that is less than the +22.4% trailing three-quarter average earnings beat, thereby disappointing investors and sending the stock into a bigger selloff, or b.) it provides a springboard higher in the case of better-than-expected earnings results later today.\n\nAlso later today, but before the closing bell rings, minutes for the latest Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting will be made public, allowing analysts to parse the language and opinion of members on how hot or cold the Fed was as of January 31st. These news events have in the past been useful tools in predicting further Fed action, but key jobs and inflation reports (Employment Situation, CPI, PPI, etc.) have been more decidedly in one direction \u2014 hotter \u2014 than speculation had been as of late last month. In short, no Fed minutes are likely to increase the odds of a rate cut at the next FOMC meeting, which ends March 20th.\n\nStory continues\n\nNot exactly a direct competitor to NVIDIA, but a major semiconductor producer nevertheless, Analog Devices ADI reported fiscal Q1 results ahead of today\u2019s open. The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell)-rated company beat expectations slightly on both top and bottom lines \u2014 +2 cents to $1.73 per share on $2.51 billion in sales, better than the $2.50 billion in the Zacks consensus \u2014 but guidance for the coming quarter were lower than previous estimates on both top and bottom lines.

While many of the top retail names will provide a glimpse on the health of the U.S. consumer and overall spending, we have one final tech giant from the Magnificent 7 that has yet to deliver its Q4 marks. The long-awaited results out of Nvidia NVDA are scheduled for today after the close, and investors are eager to see how the chip giant performed in the latest quarter.\n\nSemiconductor stocks have led the way over the past year. Robust demand for products that run cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) has boosted investor appetite for companies that produce the chips.\n\nNvidia has been at the forefront of the generative AI conversation, as the company headlines the graphics chips that are designed for complex computing applications. Several of Nvidia\u2019s customers include fellow members of the Magnificent 7, including Facebook-parent Meta Platforms and Microsoft, as they require thousands of AI chips to run their own advanced offerings.\n\nNvidia offers solutions for gaming platforms, enterprise workstations, software for cloud-based virtual computing and 3-D design, and automotive platforms for infotainment systems. A top dog in the AI space, Nvidia also provides data center platforms and systems for use in autonomous driving, accelerated computing, cryptocurrency mining, and robotics.\n\nNvidia Surpasses Amazon and Alphabet\n\nConsidered most preferred by datacenter operators, Nvidia\u2019s GPUs are likely to help the company grab a larger market space. Companies like Amazon and Alphabet are expanding their global operations, driving demand for NVDA chips. By applying its GPUs in AI models, Nvidia is expanding its base in untapped markets like automotive, healthcare, and manufacturing.\n\nJust this past week, Nvidia passed by both Alphabet and Amazon in market capitalization. The chip giant became the 3rd most valuable company in the United States:\n\nStory continues YCharts\n\nImage Source: YCharts\n\nNvidia\u2019s revenues (on a trailing twelve-month basis) of $45 billion pale in comparison to Alphabet ($307 billion) and Amazon ($575 billion), so we can see the astronomically high expectations that investors have for Nvidia moving forward. YCharts\n\nImage Source: YCharts\n\nNvidia also recently disclosed investments in its first-ever 13F filing with the SEC, providing investors with a glimpse of its long-term growth plan. Perhaps the most notable investment that Nvidia disclosed was a nearly $150 million stake in British chip designer Arm Holdings ARM. The company also disclosed stakes in SoundHound AI SOUN, a developer of AI software that is tailored to vocal recognition, and Nano-X Imaging NNOX, which develops artificial intelligence applications used in medical imaging.\n\nNVDA Stock Performance\n\nNVDA stock is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Shares exploded nearly 240% last year and have already added another 38% this year. The stock continues to trade above the widely-followed 50-day and 200-day moving averages, but has pulled back a bit heading into the earnings announcement. StockCharts\n\nImage Source: StockCharts\n\nAs earnings and revenues have soared over the past few quarters, the stock has become overvalued based on traditional metrics. With this latest rally, Nvidia now trades at more than 40 times current sales, which is the highest ever for a company of its size. We can see that this figure far exceeds the current price to sales ratio of both Alphabet (6x) and Amazon (3x). YCharts\n\nImage Source: YCharts\n\nIt goes to show that investors are willing to pay a premium price for Nvidia shares, as the growth trend is expected to remain in place for the foreseeable future.\n\nFourth-Quarter Earnings Estimates\n\nNvidia is looking to resume what has been a long history of earnings beats. Analysts covering NVDA have revised their estimates for Q4 upward by 1.34% over the past 60 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate now stands at $4.54/share, reflecting an astonishing potential growth rate of 416% relative to the year-ago period. Revenues are anticipated to grow 234% to $20.2 billion. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThese are phenomenal growth rates for a company of this size, and it\u2019s no wonder that Nvidia\u2019s stock continues to reward investors with massive outperformance. The stock was the leading performer last year out of all S&P 500 constituents.\n\nNvidia torched earnings estimates in 2023, surpassing even the most optimistic projections. The semiconductor leader has delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 18.99%. After the company reported its latest (Q3) results, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated, \u201cThe computer industry is going through two simultaneous transitions \u2013 accelerated computing and generative AI.\u201d\n\nBottom Line\n\nTechnology tends to underperform in bear markets and outperform in bull markets. That\u2019s undoubtedly been the case between the 2022 bear market and the current bull market. Strong earnings projections, technological outperformance, and a bullish AI theme all point to continued strength in semiconductors.\n\nStill, stocks in this group appear extended in the short-term, so investors will be watching closely to see how they react to the upcoming announcement from Nvidia.\n\nDisclosure: NVDA is a current holding in the Zacks Headline Trader portfolio.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article 5 Best NYSE Penny Stocks To Buy.\n\nMarkets wavered as latest data showed inflation in January 2024 was hotter-than-expected. But many analysts believe the markets overreacted as a single month's data can only delay the Fed's planned rate cuts for 2024. UBS Global Wealth Management on February 20 said it expects the Federal Reserve to begin cutting rates in June instead of May. UBS expects the first rate cut to be of 25 basis points.\n\n\"Given the upside surprises to both payrolls and inflation, we now expect the Fed to wait a bit longer before cutting rates,\" UBS economists said in a note.\n\nUBS is expecting 75 bps of cuts in 2024, lower than its previous estimate of 100 bps cuts.\n\nThe era of elevated interest rates might be prolonged amid a resilient labor market and stubborn inflation but sooner or later the Fed will begin to cut rates. That means good times might be coming for small-cap stocks or risky equities, including penny stocks, which have hitherto suffered as investors' shunned smaller companies to find refuge in high quality stocks like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA). Historical data showed small-cap stocks perform exceptionally well in the first 12 months of the Fed's first rate cut.\n\nLord Abbett in its December 2023 report took a detailed look at what the private investment management company called a dovish \"pivot\" of the Federal Reserve where it hinted that its interest rate cycle might have peaked. The Lord Abbett report also said small-cap companies perform well during rate cuts.\n\n\"Currently, in fixed income, we find the short duration space to be attractive and underallocated. A \u201cbull-steepening\u201d environment, like what we\u2019ve seen when the Fed turns dovish on policy, favors short duration. At the same time, the normalized rate environment can make active, opportunistic credit an attractive diversifier with expected returns at current yields rivaling equities. Equities, particularly small caps, historically have done very well when inflation falls and in Fed rate-cut cycles while growth equities have done well when growth slows. Finally, a more normalized rate environment means less of the \u201cfinancing for everyone\u201d that was prevalent in the zero-interest-rate era. Going forward, quality companies with greater financial strength should be able to differentiate in terms of financial performance and demand a premium. All in all, the Fed\u2019s dovish December pivot shocked the markets and set the table for better performance by risk assets in 2024. What a difference a week can make,\" the report added.\n\nStory continues 12 Best NYSE Penny Stocks To Buy\n\nImage: Depositphotos\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we first used a stock screener to identify NYSE stocks trading under $5.

In these cities, traffic congestion contributes to 20% to 25% of the outdoor pollution, and I hope that Archer can be a part of reducing that over the next decade. I founded Archer to help give back time to millions of people and to make cities smarter, better, cleaner, more efficient places to live. Now that Midnight is flying and we are well along the pathway to commercialization, it\u2019s clear that major cities around the world have the same goals as Archer does.\"\n\nRead the entire earnings call transcript here.\n\n6.

The chip giant's earnings could be a make or break moment for markets, which pulled back after hotter than expected inflation data. That's only furthering hopes that NVIDIA could turn things around. So can they?\n\nWell, the bar is really high. The stock is up about 47% this year, which made Nvidia surpass both Amazon and Alphabet in market cap. And this comes after Nvidia rallied by over 200% in 2023. All that rallying means Nvidia has gotten pricey. If forward guidance doesn't justify the company's valuation, the AI- powered Nvidia balloon could pop.\n\nOne Bank of America analyst said while any post-earnings moves from Nvidia would be notable, they'd also be brief. Now that could be due to the company's revenue, which is expected to triple this quarter to over $20 billion. Now for context, the company's full year revenue in 2023 was $27 billion, the increase primarily due to data center revenue, which accounts for about 80% of Nvidia's sales. Wedbush analysts are zeroing in on those data center sales, which they expect to deliver good news this week.

At around $152 per share, Qualcomm is still down just over 19% from its 2022 all-time high. Given the ongoing AI boom, it\u2019s hard to envision a semiconductor stock with AI exposure that\u2019s not melting up to new highs.\n\nThough, there are some question marks clouding Qualcomm\u2019s future. Most notably, what happens when Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) successfully creates its own modem, a move that would essentially give Qualcomm\u2019s modem the boot from a future iPhone model?\n\nAs it turns out, making cellular modems is no easy feat. And with Apple extending its modem deal with Qualcomm through 2026, it seems like Apple\u2019s foray into modems has been a tad rockier than anticipated. Only time will tell if Apple is able to replace Qualcomm in a few years. Regardless, expect Qualcomm to be less reliant on Apple over time as it looks to make a deeper dive into the world of AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt 21.8 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E), QCOM stock certainly looks cheaper than most other semiconductor stocks hogging the headlines of late.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (TSM) TSM stock: the Taiwan Semiconductor logo on the side of its facility in Taiwan\n\nSource: ToyW / Shutterstock\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) found itself flirting with all-time highs before slipping by around 5% over the past week and change. As critical as the firm is to the future of the AI chip market, you wouldn\u2019t expect the firm to be overlooked. Undoubtedly, it\u2019s the uncertain geopolitical risks making shares of TSM a tough hold, even as the firm itself continues firing on all cylinders in a market that couldn\u2019t be hotter.\n\nIt\u2019s the same deal with owning Chinese stocks; there are a lot of geopolitical risks with these investments. And though TSM stock\u2019s valuation may be depressed, it\u2019s tough to tell just how much of a discount warrants a potential bear-case scenario that sees China invade Taiwan.\n\nOn the plus side, Taiwan Semiconductor is doing a great job of expanding beyond Taiwan. The world\u2019s largest foundry is set to build a second factory in Japan, a move that could take a little bit of the China-Taiwan risk off the table.\n\nArguably, it\u2019ll take much more than just another factory opening to ease this risk. In any case, I view any potential escalation in China-Taiwan tensions as a risk, not just for Taiwan Semiconductor but the entire tech sector. With that in mind, I view TSM stock as incredibly cheap at just 24.5 times trailing P/E.\n\nAMD (AMD) In this photo illustration, the AMD logo is shown on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Pamela Marciano / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe secret is out: AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) is the AI chip bet for investors who want a suitable alternative to the great Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Though AMD isn\u2019t overlooked anymore, after recently surging to new all-time highs, I think a strong case could be made for why the stock deserves more attention than top rival Nvidia as they look to battle it out at the front lines in the so-called AI war.\n\nOver the past year, AMD stock has been white-hot, up more than 121%. As jaw-dropping as the gain is, the performance still comes up short of Nvidia, which has more than tripled over the same time span. With the better chips, the better past year of performance, and the better valuation (96.2 times trailing P/E for NVDA stock vs. 334.4 times trailing P/E for AMD stock), why bother going with player number two (AMD) over the top dog (Nvidia)?\n\nAMD seems to be giving its all to challenge its AI chip rivals with an arsenal of new chip releases (like the Strix Point APUs for 2024).\n\nFurther, the company\u2019s sheer hunger for Nvidia\u2019s massive slice of the pie ought to be enough to justify diversifying into if you\u2019re overweight in any single AI stock. Whether AMD can grab a big slice of Nvidia\u2019s lunch remains to be seen. In any case, fellow InvestorPlace contributor Chris MacDonald has high hopes for AMD as it looks to continue its \u201caggressive\u201d move into AI chips.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette owns shares of Apple.

Yet, skeptics are concerned about the growth of AI in 2024 as it\u2019s an expensive undertaking and requires chips that are presently in short supply.\n\nHowever, market experts believe that the AI market will grow this year and beyond as it will successfully bridge the gap between humans and machines. AI is likely to lead to technological breakthroughs in handling various data, texts, videos and images.\n\nAI is expected to increase cerebral aptitudes with tools including virtual aids, personalized references and language understanding. Many prominent financial firms also expect AI integration to boost labor productivity and economic growth in the coming years.\n\nWith AI poised to modernize business processes, and create a congenial business environment, its market is projected to reach $305.9 billion by the end of this year, and the United States will have the largest market size, per Statista.\n\nIn reality, the AI market is estimated to witness a compound annual growth rate of 15.83% from 2024 to 2030, and eventually touch a market volume of $730.8 by 2030, added Statista.\n\nThanks to the AI boom, not only the tech bigwigs but also a slew of tech companies gained traction in recent times. Bespoke Investment Group added that all 67 stocks related to AI listed on the S&P 500 Index have soared 45.3% on average since November 2022, whereas the remaining 433 non-AI stocks advanced only 9.2% in the same period.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the AI-related group of stocks on the S&P 500 has gained an average of 3.7% year to date, more than non-AI stocks\u2019 average gain of 1.1%.\n\nThus, banking on solid growth prospects in the field of AI, astute investors should keep an eye on AI-related industry-leading companies to reap handsome returns. Such players are Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, Nvidia Corporation NVDA and International Business Machines Corporation IBM.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet has transformed from only a search engine player to a cloud-computing provider. But it\u2019s the Google search engine that has utilized AI to guide users to improve spelling while making search-related queries. At the same time, Alphabet\u2019s products, including Gmail and Google Cloud, incorporate AI functionalities to offer various services to clients.\n\nAnyhow, Alphabet\u2019s cloud division is playing a pivotal role in improving the company\u2019s top line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up 1.7% over the past 60 days. GOOGL\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current and next year is 16.6% and 14.9%, respectively.\n\nIts estimated revenue growth rate for the current and next year is 11.7% and 11.1%, respectively. GOOGL currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nNvidia was involved in providing graphic processors to PC manufacturers, a less lucrative market, for quite some time. However, the graphics processing unit market boomed on increased demand for AI services. Notably, the curiosity in AI came in after the launch of Open AI\u2019s ChatGPT.\n\nNvidia does have competition from Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD, but its commitment to achieve cutting-edge technology, is keeping it way ahead of its competitors. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up 0.4% over the past 60 days. NVDA\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current and next year is 269.5% and 64.5%, respectively.\n\nIts estimated revenue growth rate for the current and next year is 118.8% and 55.1%, respectively. NVDA currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nInternational Business Machines is known for having created one of the most powerful AI systems, such as Watson, which is used for data analysis and various kinds of decision-making. IBM did confirm that the demand for their software and services improved recently as more customers are using AI systems.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up nearly 3% over the past 60 days. IBM\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current and next year is 4.6% and 5.2%, respectively. Its estimated revenue growth rate for the current and next year is 3.1% and 4.4%, respectively.

Shares of the AI chip darling have skyrocketed over 200% over the last 12 months, easily outpacing rivals AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC).\n\nNvidia\u2019s incredible run briefly pushed its market capitalization past Amazon (AMZN) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) last week, making it the third-most-valuable publicly traded company in the world behind only Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL). But as of Tuesday, Amazon and Alphabet reclaimed their leads.\n\nFor the fourth quarter, analysts expect Nvidia to report adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $4.60 on revenue of $20.4 billion, up from adjused EPS of $0.88 on $6.1 billion a year ago. That\u2019s a year-over-year increase of 234%. To put Nvidia\u2019s performance into perspective, the company reported $27 billion in revenue for all of 2022.\n\nAnalysts expect Nvidia\u2019s Data Center revenue of $17.2 billion in the quarter, up from $3.62 billion in the same quarter last year. Nvidia\u2019s Data Center segment has quickly become its most important revenue stream thanks to the rapid increase in interest in artificial intelligence driven by the explosion in generative AI apps.\n\nIn January, Meta (META) said it is building out its AI data centers to include 350,000 of Nvidia\u2019s flagship H100 chips by the end of 2024. While Nvidia doesn\u2019t disclose the price of its chips, the H100 is estimated to cost tens of thousands of dollars. That means Meta alone will pay billions for Nvidia\u2019s chips.\n\nGaming, which used to be Nvidia\u2019s largest business segment, is expected to generate revenue of $2.7 billion, up from $1.8 billion last year.\n\nAnalysts will also be keeping an eye on Nvidia\u2019s forward guidance. The company has easily surpassed revenue guidance in the last few quarters, and another beat would signal continued strength in the AI trade.\n\nTo say that expectations for Nvidia are high would be a wild understatement. A number of Wall Street analysts have changed their price targets on the company\u2019s shares, with UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri increasing the bank\u2019s price target from $580 to $850, and Stifel\u2019s Ruben Roy setting a new target of $865 from $665. Wedbush\u2019s Matt Bryson also increased the firm\u2019s price target on Nvidia to $800 from $600.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia\u2019s growth, however, is facing challenges from all sides. The company\u2019s chief rival, AMD, is investing heavily in its own AI chips, including its new MI300X. According to AMD, the chip surpasses Nvidia\u2019s H100 in certain workloads, but Nvidia has refuted those claims, saying AMD\u2019s testing was incomplete. Intel also has its own server chips and continues to build on their capabilities. Nvidia president and CEO Jensen Huang speaks at a keynote presentation while holding the Grace Hopper superchip at COMPUTEX 2023 (Walid Berrazeg/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) (SOPA Images via Getty Images)\n\nNvidia\u2019s customers are also increasingly looking to develop their own specialized AI chips to ease their reliance on Nvidia\u2019s offerings. Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Tesla (TSLA) are just a few of the big-name firms that either currently offer or are actively developing their own in-house AI chips.\n\nThose chips are designed specifically for each company\u2019s needs, improving efficiency and power consumption, versus Nvidia\u2019s more generalized chips. But Nvidia isn\u2019t taking this threat lying down. According to Reuters, the company has met with Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI to discuss building custom chips for them.\n\nIn addition to rivals, Nvidia continues to contend with US export restrictions on its most powerful chips to China. While the company has said that the ban won\u2019t impact its financial situation at the moment, it has expressed concern that the measure could cause it to miss out on potential sales in the future.

lifted its stock to record highs, aligning with trends seen in Microsoft, Nvidia, and Arm, but despite concerns of a bubble, current indications suggest otherwise.\n\nMorgan Stanley research positions ASML as the second most \"overowned\" European equity, following Novo Nordisk in the pharmaceutical sector.\n\nShares in the Dutch group have soared more than 20% since the start of the year, propelled by increased demand for chip technology on the back of fast-moving progress in AI and making it Europe\u2019s most valuable European tech firm.\n\nASML manufactures hardware that manufacturers buy to produce their chips, giving the company a rising tide effect as orders pile up for other semiconductor producers.\n\nMorgan Stanley research, which tracks 277 investment funds worth a combined $1.2 trillion, would suggest that demand has pushed the semiconductor giant into overvalued territory, reaching near the top of the list for stocks among global fund managers.\n\nOverowned stocks are usually regarded as a negative signal, indicating their share price is higher than their underlying market value, and would assume a market correction is likely.\n\nAn AI bubble?\n\nAnalysts have been warning of a bubble for some time as markets defy months of high inflation and rising interest rates, as the S&P 500 rose more than 24% last year.\n\nThe AI sector has become an increasingly important microcosm of this trend.\n\nNvidia\u2019s stock more than tripled in value last year, while a 40% bump this year helped propel the AI chip pioneer above Amazon to become the fourth most valuable company in the U.S.\n\nShares in Softbank-owned U.K. AI darling Arm jumped nearly 50% on the day it released third-quarter earnings that showed surprising levels of demand for its royalty-generating AI technologies.\n\nInvestors have piled their money into the most obvious benefactors of demand for AI, like tech companies and chip producers.\n\nOther sectors may reap the benefits too, with Goldman Sachs\u2019 head of macro research in Europe, Peter Oppenheimer, comparing the buzz to the canal boom of the 18th century.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe hype divided analysts last year, though fears appear to have died down since.\n\nIn August, DeVere Group CEO Nigel Green warned buzz around AI was reaching \"fever pitch\" as Nvidia galloped away.\n\n\u201cThis level of hype is dangerous as it could lead investors to assume that these stocks are a silver bullet to build long-term wealth,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they are not, at least not on their own.\u201d\n\nThe other trend that has pushed ASML into \u201coverowned\u201d territory, however, is likely a result of a growing herd mentality among investors in recent years, who have been keen to pile into a stock market that keeps returning huge gains.\n\nFund managers tend to select a collection of high-value stocks in an indexed form, with the stake in each company declining as it falls in value.\n\nThat helped the U.S.\u2019s \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d stock group, including Microsoft, Apple, and Tesla, which carried several S&P 500-tracking funds to positive returns last year.\n\nFor ASML, past trends suggest it could continue to ride this bullish wave for some time.\n\nMarina Zavolock, Morgan Stanley\u2019s chief European equity strategist, said: \u201cOverowned stocks are outperforming both the index and underowned stocks since the market lows of October, a typical occurrence in rising markets.\n\n\u201cInterestingly, European funds' largest overweights have seen the best performance among the three fund groups from October lows and this has broadly been a trend since 2017.\u201d\n\nASML loses Samsung\n\nNot everyone is joining the herd and piling into ASML stock, and the company is more likely to be concerned about its business fundamentals than fund managers\u2019 behaviors as a chip war ensues across the globe.\n\nThe group was delivered a blow this week as Samsung announced it was withdrawing its entire 0.4% stake in ASML, Bloomberg first reported citing financial disclosures from the South Korean tech giant.\n\nThe group is also facing a challenge from camera and printer producer Canon, which is hoping to undercut ASML with $150 million chipmaking machines.\n\nShares in the Dutch semiconductor giant have dipped in value by more than 3% in the last week.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/semiconductor-giant-asml-one-europe-124853840.html", "symbols": ["ASME.F",

That trajectory would see the market hit close to $2 trillion before the end of the decade.\n\nAI can potentially boost countless industries, from healthcare to consumer tech, education, e-commerce, cloud computing, autonomous vehicles, and much more. With growth catalysts across multiple sectors, it could be one of the smartest moves to dedicate a portion of your portfolio to AI and profit from its long-term development.\n\nAs the world's first- and fourth-most valuable companies, Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) and Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) are two attractive options. These companies are heavily investing in AI and have secured powerful roles in the market, with one leading the software side of AI and the other dominating hardware. MSFT Chart\n\nMicrosoft and Nvidia stocks have already made more than a few millionaires, with their shares skyrocketing over the last decade (as seen in the chart above). While past growth doesn't always indicate what's to come, I wouldn't bet against these tech firms delivering significant gains thanks to AI long into the future.\n\nSo, here are two AI stocks that could set you up for life.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia has become a Wall Street darling since the start of last year after snapping up an estimated 80% to 95% market share in AI graphics processing units (GPUs), the chips necessary for training and running AI models.\n\nIncreased interest in AI has led to a spike in demand for GPUs. Meanwhile, Nvidia's years of dominance in the GPU market allowed it to get a head start in the segment while rivals like Advaned Micro Devices and Intel scrambled to catch up. These chipmakers have since unveiled competing AI GPUs, but will likely have difficulties overcoming Nvidia's lead. NVDA Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nOver the last year, Nvidia's quarterly revenue, operating income, and free cash flow have hit new heights as each has delivered triple-digit growth thanks to soaring chip sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn fact, Nvidia's free cash flow hit more than $17 billion in 2023, significantly higher than AMD's just over $1 billion and Intel's negative $14 billion. Nvidia's running start in AI has given it the financial resources to continue investing in its business and retain its lead in AI.\n\nThe uses for artificial intelligence are rapidly expanding, suggesting GPU demand will continue rising for the foreseeable future.\n\nNvidia has an exciting long-term outlook as it continues developing in AI and supplies its chips to other areas of tech, such as video game consoles, PCs, and cloud platforms. Its price/earnings-to-growth ratio has dropped 85% in the last six months to an attractive 0.4, indicating it could be trading at a bargain compared to its growth potential.\n\nNvidia is a screaming buy for anyone looking to invest in AI and could deliver major gains for years.\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nIn January, Microsoft surpassed Apple as the world's most valuable company, with its market cap currently at just over $3 trillion. The company is a tech behemoth with positions in multiple areas of the industry, leading in productivity software, game consoles, cloud computing, and operating systems.\n\nMeanwhile, heavy investment in ChatGPT developer OpenAI has led to a lucrative partnership and access to some of the most advanced AI models in the industry. The Windows company has used OpenAI's technology to introduce AI features across its product lineup.\n\nIn 2023, Microsoft added new AI tools to its Azure cloud platform, integrated aspects of ChatGPT into its Bing search engine, and boosted productivity in its Office software suite with the help of AI.\n\nMoreover, the company is taking early steps to monetize its new offerings, launching an AI assistant called Copilot through its Microsoft 365 subscription service. The company describes the assistant as \"your everyday AI companion.\" Some of its generative capabilities include creating a first draft in Word, generating a full PowerPoint presentation based on a simple prompt, and producing data visualizations in seconds in Excel.\n\nCopilot has debuted as a $30 monthly add-on to a 365 membership, which could lead to significant earnings boosts for Microsoft.\n\nThe tech giant achieved more than $67 billion in free cash flow last year, highlighting the reliability of its business and its value as a long-term investment. The company's stock is slightly overvalued, with its forward price-to-earnings ratio at about 35. However, its long history of growth, dominant role in tech, and expanding venture into AI means it is likely worth its high valuation.\n\nThe company is profiting from tailwinds across tech and has excellent prospects in AI, suggesting a long-term investment in Microsoft's stock could set you up for life.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

(Sipa US, Sipa US)\n\nNvidia (NVDA)\n\nNvidia is set to release its latest financial results after Wall Street closes today, and stakes are high thanks to its share price more than tripling last year amid AI enthusiasm.\n\nThe chip maker, which dominates the market for data center AI chips, is expected to announce sales revenues of around $20bn (\u00a315.86bn) in the fourth quarter and earnings per share of $4.60. This compares to just around $6bn in sales a year ago, and EPS of just 88 cents.\n\nA miss in earnings or lower forward guidance is likely to cause a wave of profit taking in the technology sector and also drag the broader market. But a stronger than expected report could add to the upward momentum and draw in more investors who are already experiencing some degree of FOMO.\n\nNeil Wilson, chief market analyst for Finalto, said: \"Signs of tension were evident yesterday as NVDA dropped more than 4% and dragged the rest of the market south.\n\n\"At 30x earnings there is little room above and the market is a tad worried about a 50% YTD gain unravelling on earnings \u2013 profit taking I guess you would call it. I still think there is a material chance that 2025 estimates are revised higher though.\"\n\nHSBC (HSBA.L)\n\nHSBC fell out of favour with investors on Wednesday despite it revealing a near 80% jump in pre-tax profits which rose to $30.35bn (\u00a324bn) in 2023, driven by high interest rates.\n\nShares slumped more than 7% as Europe's largest bank missed forecasts due to a $3bn (\u00a32.3bn) impairment from its stake in a Chinese bank, the Bank of Communications.\n\nThe bank\u2019s 2023 pre-tax profit jumped 78% to $30.35bn, while net profit rose 56% to $22.43bn. The steep rise in full-year earnings prompted the bank to announce fresh share buybacks of up to $2bn.\n\nThe London-headquartered bank also announced a fourth interim dividend of $0.31 per share, resulting in a total for 2023 of $0.61 per share.\n\n\u201cOur record profit performance in 2023 enabled us to reward our shareholders with our highest full-year dividend since 2008, three share buy-backs last year totalling $7bn, and a further share buy-back of up to\u201d $2bn, group chief executive Noel Quinn said.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn addition to three share buybacks totalling $7bn, Quinn said the bank returned $19bn to shareholders last year.\n\nRead more: HSBC full-year profits surge fuelled by high interest rates\n\nGlencore (GLEN.L)\n\nGlencore slipped into the red in London as the miner revealed that lower commodity prices halved its earnings last year.\n\nShares dropped to their lowest level in a year after underlying profits fell 50% to $17.1bn (\u00a313.5bn), although it was still one of the company\u2019s best ever performances.\n\nIt saw profits surge in the wake of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 as an energy crisis hit Europe.\n\nGlencore lowered its dividend to $1.6bn and for the first time in several years did not announced a new share buyback program.\n\nIt also slashed its dividend to investors, as it aims to fund the acquisition of a 77% stake in Teck Resources\u2019 metallurgical coal business.\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: European stocks head lower as UK posts largest January budget surplus\n\n\u201cAlthough the current macroeconomic environment remains challenging, global economic growth is forecast to bottom out in 2024,\u201d chief executive officer Gary Nagle said.\n\n\u201cExpected interest rate cuts and corresponding restocking along the supply chain are likely to bring an improvement in demand conditions in western markets later in the year.\u201d\n\nThe company also recorded $2.5bn of writedowns at year-end, including $762m on its Mutanda copper and cobalt mine in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nBAE Systems (BA.L)\n\nBAE Systems has predicted slower earnings growth in 2024 after a 14% jump last year, when the defence company's order backlog swelled to a record level. This was driven by new submarine contracts and demand amid the Ukraine war.\n\nUnderlying earnings per share for the current year are expected to rise 6% to 8% compared to the better-than-expected 14% increase to 63.2 pence it reported for 2023.\n\nThe British weapons maker added that it won contracts worth \u00a338bn last year, including deals related to the next generation of the UK\u2019s nuclear deterrent submarines, the Aukus defence pact and combat vehicles being bought by central and eastern European countries.\n\nCharles Woodburn, chief executive, said: \"While most of our order volume was driven by existing programme positions that pre-date the Ukraine conflict, orders to restock and upgrade heavy armour and munitions are starting to come through,\"\n\nBAE is forecasting sales growth of 10-12% this year, above the 9% recorded last year, and increased its annual dividend by 11%.\n\nHowever, shares tumbled as much as 3% on the day.\n\nWatch: What are SPACs?\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.", "link": "https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-hsbc-glencore-bae-systems-trending-tickers-112011311.html", "symbols": ["0005.HK", "8GC.F", "8GC.MU", "8GCA.F", "8GCA.STU", "BA.LSE", "BAESF.US", "BAESY.US", "BSP.BE", "BSP.DU", "BSP.F", "BSP.STU", "BSP.XETRA", "BSPA.F", "GLCNF.US", "GLEN.LSE", "GLENN.MX", "GLN.JSE", "GLNCY.US", "H1SB34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.997, "neg": 0.052, "neu": 0.815, "pos": 0.133}}, {"date": "2024-02-21T11:06:52+00:00", "title": "Marketmind: Nvidia chipped while Fed minutes pass", "content": "A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan\n\nIt's a measure of sheer scale of tech-sector dominance that Wednesday's results from the most valuable chipmaker probably overshadows a readout on the Federal Reserve's most recent deliberations.\n\nEither way, the keenly awaited quarterly update from artificial intelligence darling Nvidia and the minutes of the Fed's Jan 30-31 meeting will vie for most market attention later.\n\nAs the AI-infused trebling of Nvidia's stock price over the past year now makes it a top five market cap, jitters about whether its latest results can continued to meet a sky-high bar of expectations were largely responsible for the sharp retreat of Wall St benchmarks this week.\n\nThe S&P500 dropped 0.6% and the Nasdaq lost almost 1% on Tuesday and futures on both remain in the red premarket today.\n\nNvidia tumbled 4.35%, its biggest percentage fall since October, while the broader Philadelphia semiconductor index declined 1.56% as other chip stocks followed.

It charges customers for access to the platform and shares revenue with the photo companies.\n\nStory continues\n\nEach time BRIA generates an image, it displays the original licensed images that contributed data toward that output and accounts for how much came from each.\n\nAdato likens the approach to a Spotify model for the AI era, which compensates content owners for their role in enabling the technology.\n\nControlled training also guards against the technology being used to create misleading visuals that could tarnish brands or influence elections, he said.\n\nBRIA's model, for instance, is not capable of generating an image of U.S. President Joe Biden because it has never been taught what he looks like, said Adato.

Here's the Best of the Bunch.", "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) announces its fourth-quarter and full-year 2023 results this week. It's likely to report full-year revenue in the ballpark of $60 billion. Roughly 45% of whatever revenue the chipmaker generates will roll to the bottom line.\n\nWe now know more details about how Nvidia is putting some of its huge profits to work. The company revealed last week that it has invested in five artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. Here they are -- and I'll highlight which is the best of the bunch.\n\n1. Arm Holdings\n\nBack in 2020, Nvidia announced plans to acquire what is now Arm Holdings(NASDAQ: ARM) for $40 billion. That deal ultimately fell apart because of regulatory challenges. However, Nvidia now owns a small stake in Arm following a purchase of around 1.96 million shares that are currently worth over $250 million.\n\nArm's CPUs are used in over 99% of the world's smartphones. CEO Rene Haas said in Arm's fiscal 2024 third-quarter conference call earlier this month that the company is \"seeing strong momentum and tailwinds from all things AI.\" He specifically mentioned that Arm's technology is being used in Nvidia's Grace Hopper 200 AI superchip and Alphabet's\u00a0Google Gemini Nano Pixel 6.\n\n2. Nano-X Imaging\n\nNvidia merely nibbled with its new position in Nano-X Imaging(NASDAQ: NNOX). The huge chipmaker purchased 59,632 shares that are currently valued at more than $770,000. That amounts to pocket change for Nvidia.\n\nWhat does Nvidia like about Nano-X? The company developed a digital X-ray machine that can dramatically cut the costs of medical imaging. It's also using AI to help diagnose patients, receiving U.S. Food and Drug Administration clearance for technology that identifies patients at risk of coronary artery disease.\n\n3. Recursion Pharmaceuticals\n\nRecursion Pharmaceuticals(NASDAQ: RXRX) ranks as Nvidia's second-biggest recent AI investment, trailing behind only Arm Holdings. Nvidia bought over 7.7 million shares of Recursion worth close to $230 million today.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere's been a lot of buzz in recent years about the use of AI in speeding up drug development. Recursion's technology has also demonstrated how much AI can help. The biotechnology company's pipeline features five programs in clinical testing. Its big pharma partners include Bayer and Roche.\n\n4. Soundhound AI\n\nFor a company with AI in its name, Soundhound AI(NASDAQ: SOUN) has performed dismally over the past 12 months. However, Nvidia's small investment in the company (roughly 1.73 million shares now worth around $6.6 million) provided a big boost.\n\nSoundhound AI is a leader in voice AI. Its technology powers AI systems used in vehicles made by major carmakers including Honda, Kia, and Stellantis (which markets Alfa Romeo, Chrysler, Dodge, Fiat, Jeep, Maserati, and more). Soundhound is also a major player in the restaurant technology market, with customers including Krispy Kreme and White Castle.\n\n5. TuSimple Holdings\n\nNvidia also recently bought nearly 3.47 million shares of TuSimple Holdings,\u00a0a stake now valued at over $13 million. TuSimple is the smallest company in which Nvidia has invested, with a market cap of a little over $130 million. It's also the only Chinese company in the group.\n\nTuSimple develops autonomous semi trucks. Its self-driving trucks have logged around 10 million miles to date. The company is especially targeting China and Japan, both of which have encouraging regulatory environments for autonomous trucks.\n\nBest of the bunch\n\nWe can use a process of logical elimination to pick the best of these Nvidia investments. TuSimple can be quickly removed from contention. Last month, the company announced its plans to delist its stock from the Nasdaq stock exchange and become privately held, a move it completed in mid-February.\n\nNano-X, Recursion Pharmaceuticals, and Soundhound AI remain unprofitable. All three companies could have great potential over the long run, but I think their financial positions are problematic.\n\nThat leaves Arm Holdings as the best of the bunch. The company's business continues to deliver solid growth. AI will almost certainly provide a major tailwind for Arm for years to come. While Arm beats out the other four recent Nvidia investments, though, its valuation is concerning. Shares now trade at a forward earnings multiple of over 81.\n\nMy view is that investors looking for a great AI stock to buy will be better off going with Nvidia itself rather than Arm, Nano-X, Recursion Pharmaceuticals, or Soundhound. It has strong growth prospects. It's highly profitable. And while its valuation could seem pricey, Nvidia stock is still much cheaper than Arm.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

Wednesday, Feb. 14, was the last day for institutional investors with at least $100 million in assets under management to file Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nA 13F provides investors with a detailed snapshot of what Wall Street's top money managers bought and sold in the most recent quarter (in this case, the December-ended quarter). Despite being up to 45 days old when filed, 13Fs can still offer clear clues as to what stocks, industries, and trends are garnering the attention of asset managers. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nFor more than a year, no trend has been captivating the attention of investors and professional money managers quite like artificial intelligence (AI). Broadly speaking, AI involves the use of software and systems to oversee tasks typically given to humans. With the incorporation of machine learning, these software and systems are able to learn and evolve over time, thereby becoming more effective at their tasks.\n\nWhat's made AI such a thrilling investment thesis is that virtually all sectors and industries can benefit from the technology. Based on a May 2023 report from PwC, AI could add $15.7 trillion to worldwide gross domestic product by 2030.\n\nAlthough many of Wall Street's smartest, most successful money managers thrived by holding stakes in AI stocks throughout most of 2023, the latest round of 13Fs shows that a number of billionaires sold their stakes in a few high-flying AI stocks way too soon.\n\nNvidia\n\nThe first artificial intelligence stock that's made billionaire money managers regret their decision to sell is none other than the infrastructure backbone of the AI movement, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). During the fourth quarter, eight prominent billionaires lightened their fund's stakes, including (total shares sold in parentheses):\n\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management (1,689,322 shares) Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International (1,170,611 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (1,088,821 shares) David Tepper of Appaloosa Management (235,000 shares) Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (218,839 shares) Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management (142,900 shares) David Siegel and John Overdeck of Two Sigma Investments (30,663 shares)\n\nStory continues\n\nThrough the closing bell on Feb. 16, Nvidia has gained nearly 47%, or almost $231 per share, on a year-to-date basis. This means Englander's fund has left at least $390 million on the table this year, if not more, depending on when Millennium Management exited its close to 1.69 million shares.\n\nThe two factors that have powered Nvidia higher are its innovation and pricing power. With regard to the former, the company's A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) have demonstrated incredible speed and efficiency in AI-accelerated data centers. Many of the largest AI players, which include Microsoft and Meta Platforms, have placed big orders for Nvidia's GPUs.\n\nThe second factor -- Nvidia's exceptional pricing power -- is the result of its GPUs being in high demand. When the demand for a product is high but supply is constrained, the price of said product will increase until demand levels out. The fact that Nvidia's cost of revenue moved only modestly higher through the first nine months of fiscal 2024 (ended in January 2024) while companywide sales jumped by 86% demonstrates that Nvidia's pricing power is doing the heavy lifting.\n\nWhat'll be interesting in 2024 is whether Nvidia can sustain its stellar results. An increase in GPU production threatens to cannibalize its own pricing power. Meanwhile, external and internal competitors are gathering at the proverbial gate to challenge Nvidia.\n\nSuper Micro Computer\n\nA second AI stock that likely has billionaires kicking themselves because they sold way too soon is server and storage company Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI). During the December-ended quarter, four prominent billionaires sold shares, including (total shares sold in parentheses):\n\nSteven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (255,383 shares) Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (144,833 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (93,827 shares) Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International (72,237 shares)\n\nIn less than seven weeks since the year began, Super Micro's shares have catapulted higher by 183%, or about $519 per share. They're also up by a jaw-dropping 878% since the start of 2023. For Steven Cohen's Point72, it means leaving more than $132 million on the table in under two months.\n\nWhat's made Super Micro such a hot commodity for AI investors is the customizable rack-scale servers it's supplying to businesses operating AI-accelerated data centers. Since Super Micro's rack-scale servers use Nvidia's top-notch GPUs, it's somewhat linked Super Micro's success to that of Nvidia. When one moves higher, so has the other.\n\nAlthough Cohen, Griffin, Englander, and Yass may be sore that they missed out on some historic gains to begin 2024, their exit may ultimately prove prudent. Historically speaking, every next-big-thing trend for the past three decades has endured an early-stage bubble. In fact, Super Micro fizzled out years earlier when growth expectations for the company during the cloud boom failed to materialize. If history is right, AI demand won't come anywhere close to matching investors' otherworldly expectations for the technology -- at least in the early going.\n\nThe other problem for Super Micro Computer is that it's entirely dependent on its suppliers, which includes Nvidia. As long as the supply of Nvidia's high-powered GPUs remains constrained, it'll be difficult for Super Micro to max out its own demand. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nArm Holdings\n\nThe third AI stock billionaires sold way too early, based on the latest round of 13F filings, is semiconductor microprocessor intellectual property giant Arm Holdings(NASDAQ: ARM), which went public in mid-September. During the fourth quarter, six billionaire money managers parted ways with their respective fund's shares, including (total shares sold in parentheses):\n\nKen Griffin of Citadel Advisors (2,086,848 shares) Paul Singer of Elliott Investment Management (980,392 shares) Ole Andreas Halvorsen of Viking Global Investors (600,000 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (318,189 shares) Israel Englander of Millennial Management (51,007 shares) Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International (14,843 shares)\n\nOn a year-to-date basis, shares of ARM have galloped higher by roughly 71%, or a little more than $53 per share, as of the closing bell on Feb. 16. This means Ken Griffin and his team have missed out on $111 million in respective gains since the year began.\n\nArm Holdings generates all of its revenue from royalties and licensing. It designs central processing units (CPUs), and major chip companies pay Arm for the right to use its designs. It's a fantastic gig that generates incredibly high margins. A number of major AI players, including Nvidia (which has invested directly in Arm) and Microsoft, are utilizing Arm designs in their processing chips designed for AI servers.\n\nWhile Arm's blowout fiscal third-quarter operating results (ended Dec. 31) dazzled Wall Street, these six billionaires may not be hurting for long. That's because Arm's valuation could be a tough pill to swallow for investors.\n\nAlthough the company's profit forecast received a nice boost and its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) blew past consensus expectations, Arm's generally accepted accounted principles (GAAP) profit, which gives you the numbers that really matter, showed a 52% drop in net income to $87 million. Even on an adjusted basis, Arm is trading at 105 times the midpoint of its EPS forecast for fiscal 2024 and more than 41 times the midpoint of its sales forecast.\n\nDespite its juiced-up margins, Arm stock has all the hallmarks of being in an unsustainable bubble.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

The good news is that while the space has run up quite a bit, the entire industry has plenty of runway for growth ahead. Analysts from McKinsey believe the market could grow by 80% over the course of this decade and reach $1 trillion by 2030.\n\nWhile the growth of generative AI is arguably the most exciting field driving this growth, it\u2019s important to remember that other promising areas like self-driving cars, high-performance computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT) will drive further demand for semiconductors as well.\n\nSOXX\u2019s Holdings\n\nAs a directional bet on U.S. semiconductor stocks, SOXX isn\u2019t particularly diversified, and that\u2019s alright. It holds 30 stocks, and its top 10 holdings account for 60.1% of its portfolio.\u00a0Below is an overview of SOXX\u2019s top 10 holdings using TipRanks\u2019 holdings tool.\n\nSOXX has large positions in its top holdings like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO). This isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing, as these stocks are up 239.7%, 121.5%, and 113.9%, respectively, over the past year, helping drive SOXX\u2019s red-hot performance.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt\u2019s interesting to note that while these are large positions, SOXX\u2019s exposure to Nvidia is actually quite a bit lower than that of its largest competitor in the semiconductor ETF space, the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH), which features a massive 24.7% position in the AI chip leader. This isn\u2019t necessarily a good thing or a bad thing, but it does take some risk off the table for SOXX compared to SMH in the event that Nvidia\u2019s stock pulls back.\n\nBeyond these leaders in generative AI chips, I like the fact that SOXX includes stocks from all facets of the semiconductor value chain, including semiconductor fabricators and the companies that make the complex equipment and machinery used in the semiconductor manufacturing process, such as Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT), Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX), ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML), and Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM).\n\nI like this for a few reasons. First, it adds to SOXX\u2019s diversification by bringing in different parts of the semiconductor supply chain to its portfolio.\n\nSecond, these are great stocks that have generated outstanding returns for shareholders over the past year. Applied Materials is up 74.5% over the past year, Lam Research is up 89.1%, ASML is up 43.6%, and Taiwan Semiconductor is up 42.8%.\n\nFurthermore, while these stocks have surged, they aren\u2019t egregiously priced and offer better value than one might expect at first glance. For example, Taiwan Semiconductor trades at 20.2 times consensus 2024 earnings estimates, while Applied Materials trades at 24.5 2024 earnings estimates. While these numbers aren\u2019t cheap, they are roughly in line with the broader market, which is pretty attractive for stocks performing this well.\n\nLam Research and ASML are a bit more expensive, with Lam Research trading at 31.2 times 2024 earnings estimates and ASML trading at 45.6 times estimates.\n\nLastly, these stocks are collectively viewed very favorably by TipRanks\u2019 Smart Score system. The Smart Score is a proprietary quantitative stock scoring system created by TipRanks. It gives stocks a score from 1 to 10 based on eight market key factors. A score of 8 or above is equivalent to an Outperform rating. ASML and Taiwan Semiconductor feature \u2018Perfect 10\u2019 Smart Scores, Applied Materials features an Outperform-equivalent Smart Score of 9, and Lam Research has a Neutral-equivalent Smart Score of 7.\n\nLooking at the rest of SOXX\u2019s portfolio, an impressive nine of its top 10 holdings feature Outperform-equivalent Smart Scores of 8 or higher. Advanced Micro Devices, Broadcom, Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL), and the aforementioned ASML all feature 10 out of 10 Smart Scores.\n\nThe Smart Score system also takes a favorable view of SOXX itself, giving it an outperform-equivalent ETF Smart Score of 8 out of 10.\n\nScintillating Long-Term Performance\n\nTo put it simply, SOXX\u2019s long-term performance has blown the doors off of the broader market, and it\u2019s not even particularly close.\u00a0As of January 31, SOXX posted outstanding annualized returns of 16.0% over the past three years, 31.1% over the past five, and 24.5% over the past 10.\n\nFor comparison, as of January 31, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:VOO) returned 11.0% over the past three years, 14.2% over the past five years, and 12.6% over the past decade.\n\nMeanwhile, the tech-centric Nasdaq (NDX), as represented by the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ), has returned 20.7% over the past five years and 18.1% over the past 10.\n\nTo be clear, it hasn\u2019t always been a smooth ride, as SOXX has experienced plenty of volatility along the way, but the long-term trend is clearly \u201cup and to the right.\u201d For example, SOXX lost 35.1% of its value in 2022 but followed this up by bouncing back with a 67.1% return in 2023.\n\nWhat Is SOXX\u2019s Expense Ratio?\n\nSOXX\u2019s expense ratio of 0.35% means that an investor in the fund will pay $35 in fees on a $10,000 investment annually. This is the same expense ratio that other popular ETFs like the aforementioned SMH and the SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF (NYSEARCA:XSD) charge, which is probably not coincidental as these funds are all competitors.\n\nIs SOXX Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, SOXX earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on\u00a024 Buys, seven Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average SOXX stock price target of $666.76 implies 8.5% upside potential.\n\nInvestor Takeaway\n\nIn conclusion, I\u2019m bullish on SOXX based on its market-beating performance over the past decade, its portfolio of highly-rated stocks from across the semiconductor value chain, and the long-term growth prospects of the semiconductor industry. While the ETF has been on a tear, it\u2019s not too late to consider investing in SOXX, and there is room for more upside ahead, as its holdings have strong growth prospects, and many are less expensive than one would expect.\n\nDisclosure", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/soxx-powerhouse-semiconductor-etf-more-051323922.html", "symbols": ["0JT5.LSE", "AMAT.MX", "AMAT.US", "AMD.US", "AP2.BE", "AP2.DU", "AP2.F", "AP2.HM", "AP2.MU", "AP2.STU", "AP2.XETRA", "ASME.F", "ASME.XETRA", "ASMF.F", "ASML.AS", "ASML.US", "ASML34.SA", "ASMLF.US"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 1, "neg": 0.026, "neu": 0.801, "pos": 0.174}}, {"date": "2024-02-21T04:57:09+00:00", "title": "Hedge Funds Cut Magnificent Seven in Last Quarter, Goldman Says", "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Hedge funds pared exposure to the Magnificent Seven megacap tech stocks in the fourth quarter amid signs of extremes in the market, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nYour 401(k) Will Be Gone Within a Decade Capital One to Buy Discover for $35 Billion in Year's Biggest Deal  Largest Covid Vaccine Study Yet Finds Links to Health Conditions Stocks Fall Before Nvidia\u2019s Must-Watch Earnings: Markets Wrap US Tells Allies Russia May Launch Anti-Satellite Nuclear Weapon Into Space This Year\n\n\u201cFunds were net sellers of most of the Magnificent Seven stocks,\u201d as their weights rose to records, strategists including Ben Snider and Jenny Ma wrote in a note dated Tuesday that analyzed 722 hedge funds with $2.6 trillion of gross equity positions.

Some strategists have started noting a wide dispersion of consensus growth estimates across the group.\n\nThe group\u2019s earnings-reporting season has been mixed. While Meta and Amazon beat expectations, Apple and Tesla saw some weakness.

On Friday, the benchmark index pushed as high as 38,865.06 before pulling back into the close.\n\nThe broader Topix was down 0.45% at 2620.45.\n\nTraders moved cautiously ahead of the financial results, which are due later on Wednesday and could test the AI frenzy that's gripped both U.S. and Japanese markets.\n\nThe Nikkei's momentum towards the 35-year record has been stalled by Wall Street, which closed lower overnight after returning from a holiday on Monday, as investors worried whether Nvidia's quarterly results will justify its expensive valuation. The broader Philadelphia semiconductor index declined over 1% as Nvidia and other chip stocks stumbled.\n\nNikkei's tech-related shares sagged, with chip-testing equipment maker Advantest, which counts Nvidia among its customers, down 3.17%. Chip-making equipment giant Tokyo Electron fell 1.3%.\n\nSoftBank Group, which invests in an AI-focused startup, was down about 2% by the midday break.\n\nJapan's chip giants, which share ties with high tech companies in the U.S., have had a \"significant impact\" on the Nikkei, said Sumitomo Mitsui DS Asset Management's Chief Market Strategist Masahiro Ichikawa, putting plenty of weight on Nvidia's revenue report.\n\nIf the tech company's results disappoint, Ichikawa sees potential for the Nikkei to fall below 38,000 points, while a surprise to the upside could be enough to push the index to all-time highs.

The region\u2019s weak tone came after the Nasdaq 100 fell almost 1% and the S&P 500 slid below 5,000. Nvidia sank more than 4% in the run-up to its results later Wednesday, where traders will be looking for confirmation the chipmaker can meet the lofty expectations set by the artificial-intelligence boom.\n\nThe focus is also on Chinese stocks after the country\u2019s two main bourses froze the accounts of a major quantitative hedge fund for three days after the money manager dumped a large amount of shares within a minute Monday. Meantime, banks also ramped up funding help for the troubled property sector.\n\n\u201cThe company\u2019s results have become the biggest of the reporting period, acting as both a macroeconomic barometer and the proverbial canary in the coal mine for the artificial intelligence boom,\u201d said Kyle Rodda, senior market analyst at Capital.Com Inc., referring to Nvidia. \u201cThe bar for an upside surprise is set high,\u201d with its valuation at eye-watering levels, he said.\n\nThe dollar steadied and Treasury 10-year yields were little changed in Asian trading, while persistent bearishness around the outlook for China\u2019s steel demand pushed iron ore to a three-month low.\n\nIn Japan, recent loss of momentum has pulled the Nikkei 225 further away from reaching its highest-ever close of 38,915.87 in 1989. Still, macro and stock hedge funds are betting on Japan this year, predicting the central bank will shift its policy after eight years of negative interest rates. The yen steadied slightly below 150 per dollar as the nation\u2019s exports rose more than expected in January.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia Nerves\n\nThe ongoing earnings season has so far reaffirmed the view that Corporate America is holding up well, although the reporting period has been mixed for the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d megacaps. Among other highlights from the US session, Walmart Inc. climbed after reporting strong earnings while Palo Alto Networks Inc. tumbled in late trading after cutting its revenue forecast for the year.\n\nAhead of Nvidia\u2019s numbers, some traders decided to lock in profits \u2014 with the market also weighing a report that Microsoft Corp. is developing a networking card as an alternative to the one supplied by the chipmaker.\n\nThe artificial-intelligence frenzy has boosted stocks that have been linked to the technology, and Nvidia is one of the few firms to have demonstrated significant revenue growth from AI.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s January meeting minutes are also due on Wednesday, offering traders more clues about where policymakers stand on a rate-cut timeline. Faster-than-expected inflation last week fueled concerns the Fed may not begin cutting interest rates as soon \u2014 or by as much \u2014 as market participants previously expected this year.\n\nIn commodities, oil steadied as investors juggled signs of tighter supplies with elevated tensions in the Middle East and a still-shaky demand outlook.

Not only is AI-leader NVIDIA Corp. reporting, but many other companies, whose stock charts are also breaking out, are going to be reporting as well. These red-hot companies are a more extensive list than you might expect, including companies in home building, finance, travel and even the old economy.\n\nIt\u2019s not all about NVIDIA although it\u2019s chart is amazing. Tracey takes a look at 4 other companies that have also seen big gains over the last year, with several breaking out to new all-time highs. And none of these companies are even in AI. This 2024 rally has been broader than most have believed.\n\nIt\u2019s not easy to beat every quarter, or nearly every quarter, over the course of multiple years. Yet several of these companies have done that. They are earnings all-stars.\n\nWill these companies beat again and will the stocks surge to new highs?\n\n5 Phenomenal Earnings Charts\n\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA)\n\nNVIDIA has beat 4 quarters in a row. Shares are up 239% over the last year. But earnings are expected to rise 269.5% in fiscal 2024 and 64% in fiscal 2025.\n\nNVIDIA trades with a forward P/E of just 36.\n\nIs NVIDIA a bellwether stock now?\n\n2. Builders FirstSource, Inc. (BLDR)\n\nBuilders FirstSource has not missed on earnings in 5 years. That\u2019s impressive given the COVID pandemic which hit 4 years ago. Earnings are expected to fall 26% in 2023 as building and home remodeling slowed. And analysts expect earnings to decline another 6% in 2024.\n\nShares of Builders FirstSource have surged 125% to new all-time highs over the last year. It\u2019s still cheap. Builders FirstSource trades with a forward P/E of just 14.\n\nShould Builders FirstSource be on your short list?\n\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Intuit Inc. (INTU)\n\nIntuit has only missed one time in the last 5 years and it was in 2022. That\u2019s an impressive track record. Shares of Intuit are up 62% over the last year.\n\nIntuit isn\u2019t a cheap stock. It trades with a forward P/E of 40.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs Intuit priced for perfection?\n\n4. Booking Holdings Inc. (BKNG)\n\nBooking has beat 12 quarters in a row with its last miss in 2020, when the COVID pandemic began. Booking\u2019s earnings are expected to rise 49% in 2023 and another 19.6% in 2024.\n\nShares of Booking are up 51% in the last year and have broken out to new all-time highs. Booking Holdings trades with a forward P/E of just 21.\n\nWill Booking Holdings beat again this quarter?\n\n5. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B)\n\nBerkshire Hathaway usually doesn\u2019t make the earnings all-stars videos. It is lightly covered by analysts on Zacks.com. Zacks has just 2 estimates for the full year. But Berkshire Hathaway has beat 2 out of the last 4 quarters.\n\nShares are red-hot, up 32% in the last year. Berkshire Hathaway has been hitting new all-time highs in 2024.\n\nIs Berkshire Hathway too hot to handle?\n\n[In full disclosure, Tracey owns shares of BKNG in her personal portfolio, and BLDR and BRK.B in the Insider Trader and Value Investor portfolios.]\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

For example, over the past year, the Nasdaq 100 ETF (QQQ) is up a robust 45% while the S&P 500 Index ETF (SPY) is only up 24%. Drill down further into the performance metrics, and you\u2019ll find that two main areas are driving market gains \u2013 mega-cap tech stocks such as the \u201cMagnificent 7\u201d and AI/semiconductor stocks. Currently, Nvidia (NVDA) is the undisputed market leader in both areas.\n\nNvidia is a leading technology company renowned for its graphics processing units (GPUs) and parallel computing solutions. Initially recognized for its contributions to the gaming industry, the company has become indispensable to the AI revolution due to the exceptional parallel processing capabilities of its GPUs. These GPUs excel at handling complex mathematical computations essential for machine learning and artificial intelligence tasks. Nvidia\u2019s CUDA architecture and specialized hardware have become integral components in accelerating deep learning algorithms, enabling faster and more efficient training of AI models. Their GPUs are widely adopted in data centers and research institutions, playing a pivotal role in powering the computational demands of modern AI applications, from natural language processing to computer vision and autonomous systems.\n\nEPS Due Date\n\nThe world\u2019s third-largest company will report fourth-quarter earnings after the market closes on Wednesday, February 21st.\n\nEstimates\n\nZacks Consensus Estimates suggest that NVDA will deliver a scorching triple-digit earnings growth rate over the next three quarters. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nESP Score & Revisions\n\nZacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock Nvidia currently sports the coveted Zacks positive Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Score. The ESP score looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that the more recent information is, the more accurate and better predictor it is of the future. When a company has a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive ESP (like NVDA does), stocks produce a positive surprise 70% of the time while enjoying annual returns of 28.3% on average (according to our 10-year back test).\n\nStory continues\n\nImplied Move\n\nThe implied options move for a stock refers to the market\u2019s expectation of the potential price fluctuation of that stock based on the pricing of its options contracts. Specifically, it is derived from the implied volatility, a key component in option pricing models. If the implied options move is high, it suggests that market participants anticipate significant price swings in the underlying stock. Traders often look at implied volatility to gauge potential risk and adjust their strategies accordingly. The options market implies a move of + or \u2013 11% for this quarter.\n\nEarnings Surprise History\n\nNvidia has beaten Wall Street expectations for four straight quarters and has a positive average surprise of 18.99%. The company has surpassed EPS estimates, revenue estimates, and has upped guidance for four straight Q4 reports and seven of the past eight. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nKey Levels\n\nThe two primary levels for intermediate investors to watch are the rising 10-week moving average (~$600) and the all-time high of ~$750. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nSeasonality & Historical Trends\n\nFebruary is the second-best month for Nvidia. 72% of the time the stock is higher in February, with an average return of 8.5% over the past 10 years. Over the last decade, its 2017 return of -7.1% was its lowest.\n\nBottom Line\n\nNvidia is the true market leader in the AI space. Whether you own the stock or not, investors should pay close attention to its Q4 EPS report.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

These three regions accounted for 46% of Nvidia's revenue in the third quarter.\n\nInvestors will be keen to see whether Nvidia warns again that U.S. curbs on selling its chips to China are hurting its business and longer-term prospects. Nvidia has come up with new products for the Chinese market, but there is a risk that they will also be banned like its first round of China market chips.\n\nNvidia is also grappling with supply shortages at its Taiwan-based chip contractor TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker.\n\nHong Kong's Hang Seng has underperformed this year, and is currently down 4.7% year to date. The performance of its tech sector has been even more dismal - it is down 13%.\n\nBut the tentative recovery in Chinese stocks from recent five-year lows - the CSI 300 index of leading blue chips is now basically flat year-to-date - should lend support.\n\nThe Shanghai Composite and CSI300 are gunning for a sixth and seventh straight day of gains, respectively, which would be their longest winning streaks since January last year. China's interest rate cut on Tuesday could keep that run going.\n\nElsewhere on the policy front, Indonesia's central bank will keep its key seven-day repo rate unchanged at 6.00% on Wednesday, according to all 30 economists in a Reuters poll.\n\nStory continues\n\nOpinion over the rest of the year is more mixed, but the median forecast is for Bank Indonesia to start cutting rates by 25 basis points in the second quarter, and by the same amount every quarter this year, down to 5.25% by the end of December.\n\nIndonesia's inflation rate has stayed within BI's 1.5% to 3.5% target range since July, suggesting cumulative rate hikes of 250 basis points are working.

These three regions accounted for 46% of Nvidia's revenue in the third quarter.\n\nInvestors will be keen to see whether Nvidia warns again that U.S. curbs on selling its chips to China are hurting its business and longer-term prospects. Nvidia has come up with new products for the Chinese market, but there is a risk that they will also be banned like its first round of China market chips.\n\nNvidia is also grappling with supply shortages at its Taiwan-based chip contractor TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker.\n\nHong Kong's Hang Seng has underperformed this year, and is currently down 4.7% year to date. The performance of its tech sector has been even more dismal - it is down 13%.\n\nBut the tentative recovery in Chinese stocks from recent five-year lows - the CSI 300 index of leading blue chips is now basically flat year-to-date - should lend support. The Shanghai Composite and CSI300 are gunning for a sixth and seventh straight day of gains, respectively, which would be their longest winning streaks since January last year. China's interest rate cut on Tuesday could keep that run going.\n\nElsewhere on the policy front, Indonesia's central bank will keep its key seven-day repo rate unchanged at 6.00% on Wednesday, according to all 30 economists in a Reuters poll.\n\nStory continues\n\nOpinion over the rest of the year is more mixed, but the median forecast is for Bank Indonesia to start cutting rates by 25 basis points in the second quarter, and by the same amount every quarter this year, down to 5.25% by the end of December.\n\nIndonesia's inflation rate has stayed within BI's 1.5% to 3.5% target range since July, suggesting cumulative rate hikes of 250 basis points are working. The rupiah is down 1.7% against the dollar this year, but has performed better than many of its peers.\n\nElsewhere in Asia on Wednesday Japan releases its latest trade data and tankan surveys of manufacturing and non-manufacturing activity, South Korea publishes producer price inflation figures, and Australia releases hourly wage growth data for Q4 last year.\n\nHere are key developments that could provide more direction to markets on Wednesday:\n\n- Indonesia interest rate decision\n\n- Japan trade (January)\n\n- South Korea produce price inflation (January)\n\n(By Jamie McGeever; Editing by Josie Kao)", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/morning-bid-asia-chips-off-214500129.html", "symbols": ["NVD.BE", "NVD.DU", "NVD.F", "NVD.HA", "NVD.HM", "NVD.MU", "NVD.STU", "NVD.XETRA", "NVDA.MX", "NVDA.NEO", "NVDA.US", "NVDC34.SA", "NVDG.F"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.95, "neg": 0.059, "neu": 0.857, "pos": 0.084}}, {"date": "2024-02-20T21:40:35+00:00", "title": "US STOCKS-Stocks close lower as Nvidia weighs ahead of earnings", "content": "*\n\nWalmart hits all-time high on strong FY sales view\n\n*\n\nDiscover Financial jumps on Capital One's $35.3 bln buyout deal\n\n*\n\nFocus on Nvidia results due Wednesday\n\n*\n\nIndexes down: S&P 0.6%, Dow 0.17%, Nasdaq 0.92%\n\n(Updated at 4:26 p.m. ET/ 2126 GMT)\n\nBy Chuck Mikolajczak\n\nNEW YORK, Feb 20 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended lower on Tuesday, with the Nasdaq showing the largest declines as chipmaker Nvidia stumbled ahead of its highly awaited earnings report, while gains in Walmart kept losses on the Dow Industrials in check.\n\nShares of the chip designer Nvidia tumbled 4.35%, it's biggest daily percentage fall since Oct. 17, while the broader Philadelphia semiconductor index declined 1.56% as other chip stocks followed.\n\nInvestors are concerned whether Nvidia's quarterly results, expected after markets close on Wednesday, will justify its expensive valuation, currently at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of just over 32, and continue to fuel the buying frenzy around artificial intelligence (AI) related stocks.\n\nAI-fueled bets have helped Nvidia become the third-most valuable U.S. company and recently supplant Tesla as Wall Street's most traded stock.\n\n\"It is priced to perfection, no matter what they say they are probably going to take money out of it,\" said Ken Polcari, managing partner at Kace Capital Advisors in Boca Raton, Florida.\n\n\"No matter what they say, the traders are going to lock in profits, the asset managers are going to peel off a piece of their core position and lock in some profits and some of that is even happening today ahead of the number tomorrow.\"\n\nShares in Super Micro Computer, which has surged in recent weeks as the latest stock seen to benefit from AI, fell 1.96%, its second straight decline, after closing down nearly 20% on Friday to snap a nine-session streak of gains.\n\nThe S&P 500 lost 30.06 points, or 0.60%, to end at 4,975.51 points, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 144.87 points, or 0.92%, to 15,630.78. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 64.19 points, or 0.17%, to 38,56.80.\n\nStory continues\n\nWalmart closed at a record high and was the best performer on the Dow Industrials after the U.S. retail giant forecast fiscal 2025 sales largely above Wall Street expectations and raised its annual dividend by 9%.\n\nThe S&P 500 consumer staples index, which includes Walmart, rose 1.13% as sole advancer of the 11 major S&P sectors, while information technology, down 1.27% was the weakest.\n\nShares of fellow Dow component Home Depot alternated between modest gains and losses and before closing up 0.06% after the home improvement retailer forecast full-year results below analysts' estimates.\n\nA weeks-long rally on Wall Street stalled last week, as hotter-than-expected U.S. inflation data pushed back market expectations for the timing of a rate cut from the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe rate cut is expected in June, according to a slim majority of economists polled by Reuters, who also flagged risk of a further delay in the first cut.\n\nInvestors are also awaiting the release of minutes from the Fed's latest policy meeting as well as remarks from a slew of central bank officials later this week.\n\nSmart-TV maker Vizio jumped 16.26% after Walmart said it would buy the company for $2.3 billion.\n\nDiscover Financial Services shot 12.61% higher on Warren Buffett-backed consumer bank Capital One's plans to acquire the U.S. credit card issuer in a $35.3 billion deal.

A rate cut is now expected in June, according to a slim majority of economists polled by Reuters, who also flagged risk of a further delay in the first cut.\n\nThe call for further deflation has depended on below-trend economic growth, but the structural foundation for that outlook is wrong as there is little slack in the U.S. economy, said Phillip Colmar, global strategist at MRB Partners in New York.\n\n\"The whole Goldilocks soft-landing scenario was also wrong,\" he said. \"We like Goldilocks. But our experience is she doesn't visit for very long and the risk to the Goldilocks scenario was that we weren't going to have a soft landing with enough slack in the economy building up to bring down inflation.\"\n\nThe dollar index, a measure of the U.S. currency against six others, fell 0.24%, while MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.35%.\n\nThe STOXX 600 index closed down 0.10% as markets ignored European Central Bank data that showed the annual growth in negotiated wages across the euro area slowing to 4.5% in the fourth quarter last year, down from 4.7% in the prior period.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe ECB has pointed to wages as the biggest risk to its 1-1/2 year crusade against inflation. An ECB analysis of salary agreements indicates wage growth will remain high this year, while the number of companies that expect price increases is rising again, Commerzbank's senior economist Marco Wagner said in a note.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq led losses on Wall Street as chipmaker Nvidia, which reports results after markets close on Wednesday, fell 4.4%.\n\nOn Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.17%, the S&P 500 lost 0.60% and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.92%.\n\nThe response to the interest rate outlook from asset classes other than bonds has been muted so far, but U.S. economic growth compared to elsewhere will likely change the lock-step move for central bank expectations, said Marvin Loh, senior global macro strategist at State Street in Boston.\n\nSince mid-January the market has reduced rate cut expectations by 60 basis points for the Fed, the same for the Bank of Canada, 37 basis points for the ECB and 57 basis points for the Bank of England, he said.\n\n\"This change in the U.S. rates market is an economy that is performing in a way that we're not seeing in a lot of the other developed markets. Eventually you're going have to start seeing more separation,\" Loh said.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which reflects interest rate expectations, fell 4.8 basis points to 4.608%, while the yield on the benchmark 10-year note was down 2.4 basis points at 4.271%.\n\nGermany's 10-year Bund yield, which moves inversely to its price, was down 0.7 basis points at 2.378%, while the euro was 0.29% higher at $1.0811.\n\nGermany's rate-sensitive two-year yield has risen about 40 bps year to date.\n\nCHINESE RATE CUT\n\nChina's five-year loan prime rate was lowered by 25 basis points to 3.95%, bigger than the five to 15 bp cuts forecast by economists. The one-year rate was left at 3.45%, helping blue chips to finish the day up 0.2%, after an earlier fall, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index to rise 0.6%.\n\nThe yuan touched its lowest in three months in early trade before steadying at 7.1925.\n\nThe dollar weakened after China cut rates in a bid to prop up its struggling property market, raising hopes of additional stimulus that would boost global growth.\n\nThe yen gained but stayed below the 150.88 per dollar level reached last Monday, its weakest in 11 weeks, as investors focus on whether renewed weakness in the Japanese currency is likely to prompt intervention.\n\nOil prices fell more than 1%, with worries about global demand offsetting price support from the Israel-Hamas conflict.\n\nBrent futures settled down $1.22 to $82.34 a barrel. The six-month spread for Brent on Tuesday was at its highest since October, a sign of a tighter market.\n\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude for March delivery , which expires Tuesday, settled down $1.01 at $78.18 a barrel. The more actively traded April WTI contract settled down $1.30 at $77.04 a barrel.\n\nGold prices climbed to their highest level in more than a week as the dollar retreated.\n\nU.S. gold futures settled 0.8% higher at $2,039.80 an ounce.\n\n(Reporting by Herbert Lash; additional reporting by Alun John in London, Tom Westbrook in Singaoor; editing by Ros Russell, Chizu Nomiyama, Chris Reese and Deepa Babington)", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-markets-dollar-stocks-slip-212605093.html", "symbols": ["91D.F", "COMP.US", "NVD.BE", "NVD.DU", "NVD.F", "NVD.HA", "NVD.HM", "NVD.MU", "NVD.STU", "NVD.XETRA", "NVDA.MX", "NVDA.NEO", "NVDA.US", "NVDC34.SA", "NVDG.F"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": -0.775, "neg": 0.081, "neu": 0.847, "pos": 0.073}}, {"date": "2024-02-20T21:03:53+00:00", "title": "Tech Stocks Pulled Back.

With a trailing-earnings multiple of nearly 96X, it just seems a little rich. Yes, the company represents a juggernaut in the innovation space. As well, the underlying artificial intelligence narrative offers a massive addressable market. However, these catalysts appear priced into the security.\n\nOn the other hand, we have bargain tech stocks. You don\u2019t see too many articles lavishing praise over these enterprises.

However, it\u2019s also not a bad idea to show these bargain tech stocks some love.\n\nSTMicroelectronics (STM) STMicroelectronics building\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nA multinational corporation and technology firm, STMicroelectronics (NYSE:STM) \u2013 also known simply as ST \u2013 is the largest European semiconductor contract manufacturing and design company. Per its website, ST represents a leading supplier of many of the key technologies integrated into next-generation consumer devices, specifically microcontrollers. Microcontrollers are compact integrated circuits (ICs) designed to govern a certain operation in an embedded system.\n\nFundamentally, the beauty of ST lies in the expansive total addressable market. According to Grand View Research, the global microcontroller sector reached a valuation of $32.37 billion last year. Analysts project that by 2030, the segment could reach just under $70 billion in annual revenue. Driving the case for this outsized growth is the wide utility among diverse industries, including telecommunications, healthcare, and automotive.\n\nStory continues\n\nRight now, STM trades for only 15.67X forward earnings, lower than the sector median 26X. Covering analysts see shares reaching $48. However,\u00a0 the high-side target comes out to $55, implying about 22% upside potential. Therefore, it\u2019s a solid idea for bargain tech stocks to consider.\n\nIbex (IBEX) top Tech stocks to watch : Double exposure of man's hands holding and using a phone and financial graph drawing. tech stocks\n\nSource: Peshkova / Shutterstock\n\nBilled as an elite customer experience (CX) outsourcer, Ibex (NASDAQ:IBEX) serves a broad range of enterprise-level clients, from startups to scale-ups, and blue-chip giants. Per its website, the company builds powerful customer engagement and insight solutions to help protect client investments, mitigate financial and operational risk, and accelerate return on investment.\n\nAs with STMicroelectronics, Ibex may not be a household name here. Nevertheless, it enjoys a massive addressable market. Per Fortune Business Insights, the CX market reached a valuation of $14.95 billion in 2022. From 2023 to 2030, analysts anticipate that the space can expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR0 of 16.6%. If so, the industry could be worth $52.54 billion at the forecast period\u2019s culmination.\n\nPresently, IBEX trades at only 7.29X forward earnings. That\u2019s well below the software industry\u2019s median stat of 24.27X. Lastly, it makes a case for bargain tech stocks thanks to analysts pegging shares a moderate buy with a $19.75 target, which implies almost 36% upside potential.\n\nDaktronics (DAKT) Close up of phone with creative forex chart on blue background.

Designing, manufacturing, selling and servicing video displays, scoreboards, digital billboards and dynamic message signs, Daktronics is responsible for getting the word out in the crowded and competitive modern digital ecosystem.\n\nTo be fair, the broader discretionary consumer economy faces significant questions. With many companies issuing layoffs, Daktronics\u2019 ability to sell advertising displays may seem limited. Conspicuously, DAKT stock dipped about 10% since the start of the year. Nevertheless, because consumer dollars are limited, companies must fight for every greenback. That could counterintuitively help Daktronics.\n\nFurther, with the red ink, DAKT now trades at a lowly earnings multiple of 6.67X without non-recurring items (NRI). As well, shares trade at a revenue multiple of only 0.43X. And aside from a hiccup in 2019, the company has been consistently profitable.\n\nCurrently, DAKT features one analyst buy rating with a $12.80 price target, implying 66% growth potential.

Let's start with Super Micro Computer here. They're sliding in today's trade, along with some of the other big chip companies. This coming despite one Wall Street analyst raising the price target on the stock.\n\nRosenblatt's Hans Mosesmann increased his price target on Super Micro Computer to $1,300 from $700 while maintaining his buy rating. So Julie, the biggest bull on the Street right now, it's official. Team at Rosenblatt, they go to $1,300 for the server maker.\n\nThey say it's going to keep benefiting from the AI boom, basically. And the money line here, I think, is key to this story they tell their clients, is for investors to consider that the company is benefiting not only from secular AI growth but material share gains, too. And stocks slipping a bit today, but it's still up about 700% in the past 12 months.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Yeah. I mean, it's interesting if you look at the whole chip space today because being led by Nvidia downward even ahead of its earnings tomorrow. And as we've talked about, I don't think we have talked to a single analyst, even among people who follow the industry very, very closely, who are not bullish on Nvidia. Nearly everyone is. But there was an interesting note that someone shared with me from JPMorgan today that said of Nvidia, clients are either already in the stock or they won't chase the pop and they've resigned themselves to looking elsewhere within the chip industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nCertainly, Super Micro has been one of those companies that has benefited from that. JPMorgan also mentioned stocks like Broadcom and TSMC as potential beneficiaries, or other places that people are looking right now. And we are in this interesting period where Nvidia has been a rocket ship. And for those lucky enough to be riding it, they're quite happy, and others are just sort of trying to figure out where to pick their spots right now.\n\nJOSH LIPTON: Yeah, and it's show time tomorrow for Nvidia, for sure, after the bell.

Had you invested in Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0based on my recommendation in 2021, you would be sitting on huge gains today. However the competition is rising. Not every tech company will be able to be a leader in the AI industry. If you have been investing in AI stocks, it is time to reevaluate your options. After that, sell the stocks that do not show an upside potential. A few stocks simply rally due to the AI hype and do not have the potential to deliver. It is best to get rid of them while you can. Here are the three overhyped AI stocks to sell this month.\n\nC3.ai (AI) C3IoT (AI) website displayed on a modern smartphone\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nAn emerging leader in the Artificial Intelligence space, C3.ai (NYSE:AI)\u00a0 has grown significantly in 2023. It hit a high of $46 in June 2023 but has been on a downward spree since then. The stock was at an all-time high of $161 in Dec 2020. However, it hasn\u2019t been able to see those days again.\n\nWhile I do believe in the company\u2019s ability to build AI applications for businesses, I am worried about the rising competition in the industry. I do not think the company has the scalability to withstand competition and achieve profitability anytime soon. It is reporting double-digit revenue growth, but it isn\u2019t profitable yet.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe stock is down 9% over the past six months. The management has been promising profitability for a while now. Earlier, the company was aiming for a profit in 2024, but it is now expecting to report a profit in the second half of 2025. I will only believe it when I see it. The competition is intense, and the industry is rewarding AI stocks, but not all the stocks are going to win.\n\nOn the other hand, C3.ai has been growing losses. Its guidance for full-year operating loss is expected between $115 million to $135 million. This is more than the loss of the same period prior year. C3.ai may have the right products, but fundamentally, the company doesn\u2019t look in good shape. It is best to sell the stock while you can make some money out of it. While C3.ai does have something to offer, it might not be the best AI stock right now. You can see why it made our list of AI stocks to sell.\n\nStory continues\n\nBaidu (BIDU) An image of a laptop on a table with the screen showing the red and blue logo for Chinese Internet company \"Baidu\", with the background being blurred.\n\nChinese tech giant Baidu (NYSE:BIDU) stock is down 23% in the year and 7% year to date. Trading at $107 today, the stock is down from the highs of $339 it enjoyed in 2021. The company owns the largest online search engine in China and makes most of its revenue from the online marketing business.\n\nWith a cooldown in China\u2019s market, Baidu saw a drop in online marketing revenue and it continued to spend money on AI-related investments. Still, its cloud business hasn\u2019t been able to achieve much over the past few years and has a very small market share.\n\nThe company is unprofitable, and its losses are mounting. For the past six months, the stock has been trading in the range of $100 to $146, and I do not think it will rally anytime soon. The company is growing at a very slow pace, and by the time it achieves the AI goals, it could be too late. Investors shouldn\u2019t bet on this company until they see the numbers improve.\n\nIt hasn\u2019t been able to convince the businesses of its AI power over the past two years, and with the United States ban on exports of chips to China, it could become a tough ride for the company to survive. Without the necessary chips, it might not be possible to run the AI models or applications and this could put a break in Baidu\u2019s growth story. Sell the stock before it dips below $100.\n\nArm Holdings (ARM) ARM company logo or ARM Holding plc logo on smartphone hardware. is a British semiconductor and software design company owned by SoftBank group\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nArm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) has been seeing major ups and downs over the past few weeks. The inflation report took the stock down even though the company reported impressive quarterly results, it later went from $77 to $$113 in just one day. The swings in ARM stock do not sit well with me and it reminds me of the meme stocks which were solely driven by the AI hype.\n\nThe company has recently gone public, and its strong financials with a highly optimistic outlook about the demand for microchips has led to a surge in the stock price. However, I am uncertain of how sustainable the company\u2019s growth is.\n\nAlso, the 180-day post-IPO lockup period will end next month and this is when insiders could sell their shares to take profits. It could lead to a strong dip in the price. Due to the lockup, only 9.5% of the shares are currently traded and the remaining will become eligible for trading in March.\n\nFor a newly listed company, such a rally in stock price could mean a red flag. Selling ARM stock while it is at its peak could be a smart move. The company is genuine, but the stock is selling at a premium, and if you want to invest, wait for a dip before you make the move. If you already own the stock, sell it and make the most of the recent upside. After that, make sure you also dropped the other AI stocks to sell we mentioned.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Revenue expected to jump 234%", "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) will announce its fourth quarter earnings after the bell on Wednesday, one of the most highly anticipated earnings reports in recent memory. Shares of the AI chip darling have skyrocketed 184% over the last 12 months, easily outpacing rivals AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC), which saw their shares rise 91% and 67%, respectively.\n\nNvidia\u2019s incredible run briefly pushed its market capitalization past Amazon (AMZN) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) last week, making it the third most valuable publicly traded company in the world behind only Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL). But as of Tuesday, Amazon and Alphabet reclaimed their leads over Nvidia.\n\nFor the fourth quarter, analysts expect Nvidia to report adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $4.60 on revenue of $20.4 billion, up from adj. EPS of $0.88 on $6.1 billion a year ago. That\u2019s a year-over-year increase of 234%. To put Nvidia\u2019s performance into perspective, the company reported $27 billion in revenue for all of 2022. Nvidia president and CEO Jensen Huang speaks at a keynote presentation while holding the Grace Hopper superchip at COMPUTEX 2023 (Photo by Walid Berrazeg/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) (SOPA Images via Getty Images)\n\nAnalysts expect Nvidia\u2019s Data Center revenue of $17.2 billion in the quarter, up from $3.62 billion in the same quarter last year. Nvidia\u2019s Data Center segment has quickly become its most important revenue stream thanks to the rapid increase in interest in artificial intelligence driven by the explosion in generative AI apps.\n\nIn January, Meta (META) said it is building out its AI data centers to include 350,000 of Nvidia\u2019s flagship H100 chips by the end of 2024. While Nvidia doesn\u2019t disclose the price of its chips, the H100 is estimated to cost tens of thousands of dollars. That means Meta alone will pay billions for Nvidia\u2019s chips.\n\nGaming, which used to be Nvidia\u2019s largest business segment, is expected to generate revenue of $2.7 billion, up from $1.8 billion last year.\n\nAnalysts will also be keeping an eye on Nvidia\u2019s forward guidance. The company has easily surpassed revenue guidance in the last few quarters, and another beat would signal continued strength in the AI trade.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo say that expectations for Nvidia are high would be a wild understatement. A number of Wall Street analysts have changed their price targets on the company\u2019s shares, with UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri increasing the bank\u2019s price target from $580 to $850, and Stifel\u2019s Robin Roy setting a new target of $865 from $665. Wedbush\u2019s Matt Bryson also increased the firm\u2019s price target on Nvidia to $800 from $600.\n\nNvidia\u2019s growth, however, is facing challenges from all sides. The company\u2019s chief rival, AMD, is investing heavily in its own AI chips, including its new MI300X. According to AMD, the chip surpasses Nvidia\u2019s H100 in certain workloads, but Nvidia has refuted those claims, saying AMD\u2019s testing was incomplete. Intel also has its own server chips and continues to build on their capabilities.\n\nNvidia\u2019s customers are also increasingly looking to develop their own specialized AI chips to ease their reliance on Nvidia\u2019s offerings. Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Tesla (TSLA) are just a few of the big-name firms that either currently offer or are actively developing their own in-house AI chips. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nThose chips are designed specifically for each company\u2019s needs, improving efficiency and power consumption, versus Nvidia\u2019s more generalized chips. But Nvidia isn\u2019t taking this threat lying down. According to Reuters, the company has met with Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI to discuss building custom chips for them.\n\nIn addition to rivals, Nvidia continues to contend with US export restrictions on its most powerful chips to China. While the company has said that the ban won\u2019t impact its financial situation at the moment, it has expressed concern that the measure could cause it to miss out on potential sales in the future.\n\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

The artificial intelligence (AI) leader's share price was down 5.9% as of 1 p.m. ET, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nWhile there isn't any business-specific news pushing Nvidia lower today, the stock is losing ground due to macroeconomic concerns and underwhelming business results from some major players in the retail space. In particular, the graphics processing unit (GPU) specialist's share price is being pushed lower due to results and commentary from Walmart and Home Depot.\n\nWhy are retail results impacting the AI leader's stock?\n\nWhile there might not seem to be much immediate overlap between Nvidia and retail, Walmart and Home Depot are often viewed as bellwethers for the broader economy. Their quarterly results can provide a lot of valuable information about consumer sentiment and overall macroeconomic conditions, and Wall Street didn't like what it saw when the two companies reported earnings before market open this morning.\n\nWhile Walmart beat earnings expectations and issued encouraging forward guidance, the company's guidance could be taken as a sign that the economy is still running hot and that inflation isn't tapering enough. Home Depot was more explicit with its comments on inflation, stating that it was seeing unfavorable demand trends due to persistent inflation.\n\nIn addition to raising another red flag that the Federal Reserve's battle with inflation hasn't been won yet, Home Depot's comments could also be interpreted as a negative indicator for the housing market. Stocks don't trade in a vacuum, and Nvidia's valuation is feeling that today.\n\nWhat comes next for Nvidia?\n\nEven with today's pullback, Nvidia stock has risen roughly 218% over the last year. The company's explosive gains have largely been powered by surging AI-driven demand for its high-end GPUs, but expectations that the Fed will begin cutting interest rates in the near future have also played a major part in the rally.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf it looks like the central banking authority will push rate cuts further out, it could dampen bullish momentum for Nvidia. But in the ultra-near term, investors have a crucial event to narrow in on.\n\nNvidia is scheduled to report its fourth-quarter earnings results after the market closes tomorrow, and it's poised to be one of the most important stock market events of 2024. With its last update, the company guided for sales of roughly $20 billion -- suggesting growth of nearly 231%. While recent demand trends suggest there's a good chance the GPU leader will beat that guidance, the explosive run-up for its stock means that performance will be under the microscope -- and investors will be expecting perfection.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

Nvidia company logo on screen of smartphone against blurred background of up trading stock chart\n\nSource: Below the Sky / Shutterstock.com\n\nAI chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) reports its latest earnings on Feb. 21, and expectations could not be higher. Forecasts are calling for earnings per share (EPS) of $4.59, a more than 700% increase from the same quarter of last year. Some analysts are referring to the upcoming print as a make-or-break moment for the stock market. In a note to clients, Deutsche Bank said: \u201cThe most important event of the week may be Nvidia\u2019s earnings\u2026this will be very important for sentiment.\u201d\n\nAs for helping investors get rich, NVDA stock is already up 50% this year, bringing its 12-month gain to 252%. Options trading activity indicates that Nvidia\u2019s shares could rise a further 11% or more after its latest quarterly results, according to data from options analytics service ORATS. Nvidia\u2019s market capitalization now stands at $1.8 trillion, surpassing both Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google-parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL).\n\nStory continues\n\nSymbotic (SYM) Businessperson Shaking Hand With Digital Partner Over Futuristic Background, MnM stocks replacing the Magnificent 7.\n\nSource: Andrey_Popov / Shutterstock.com\n\nNow for a lesser-known name. Symbotic (NASDAQ:SYM) is not a microchip or semiconductor maker but is an AI company all the same. Symbotic is a robotics warehouse automation company based in Massachusetts. It builds and operates robots and automated systems for warehouses using proprietary AI in its software. While SYM stock has pulled back since the start of this year, it comes after a blistering rally in 2023. In the last 12 months, the stock has risen 155% and it is up 312% since going public in 2022.\n\nA few weeks ago, the company reported earnings that topped its own forecasts. Symbotic announced $14 million in adjusted EBITDA on revenue of $368 million. The company\u2019s sales were up 79% from a year earlier. Symbotic had forecast earnings of $11 million on sales of $350 million. It was the company\u2019s second quarter in a row of adjusted profitability, which is a good sign for the future. Should Symbotic continue reporting strong sales and profits, it likely won\u2019t be long until its stock is rallying again.\n\nAI Stocks: Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) A person sits at a open laptop with Google open on the screen, while holding a phone with Google search also open on the screen. GOOG stock, GOOGL stock.\n\nSource: PK Studio / Shutterstock\n\nStill out front in the global AI race is Alphabet. The company remains all-in on AI, recently rebranding its main AI chatbot as \u201cGemini\u201d and replacing the former name \u201cBard.\u201d Google\u2019s parent said it is making the change to be consistent with the name of its large-language learning models that are used to train AI applications. The name Bard was originally unveiled with the beta launch of Alphabet\u2019s first AI chatbot in March 2023.\n\nAlong with the rebrand, Alphabet announced it is launching a new mobile version of its chatbot as well as a premium paid-subscription version called \u201cGemini Advanced.\u201d Alphabet is among the first companies to start monetizing its AI offerings. Alphabet executives said they are working towards building an advanced AI assistant for both consumers and businesses. Gemini Advanced is priced at $19.99 a month, including two terabytes of cloud storage that can be shared among family members.\n\nAlphabet is cascading its AI capabilities across its suite of office products, including Gmail, Docs, Slides, Sheets, and Meet. GOOGL stock has gained 53% in the last 12 months. A $10,000 investment in Alphabet\u2019s stock on the date of its 2004 initial public offering (IPO) would be worth more than $300,000 today.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole\u00a0held long positions in NVDA and GOOGL.

But our experience is she doesn't visit for very long and the risk to the Goldilocks scenario was that we weren't going to have a soft landing with enough slack in the economy building up to bring down inflation.\"\n\nThe dollar index, a measure of the U.S. currency against six others, fell 0.30%, while MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.45%.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe STOXX 600 index lost 0.09% as markets ignored European Central Bank data that showed the annual growth in negotiated wages across the euro area slowing to 4.5% in the fourth quarter last year, down from 4.7% in the prior period.\n\nThe ECB has singled out wages as the single-biggest risk to its 1-1/2 year crusade against inflation.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq led losses on Wall Street as chipmaker Nvidia, which reports results after markets close on Wednesday, fell 6.2%.\n\nOn Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.25%, the S&P 500 lost 0.78% and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.42%.\n\nThe response to the interest rate outlook from asset classes other than bonds has been muted so far, but U.S. economic growth compared to elsewhere will likely change the move in lock-step for central bank expectations, said Marvin Loh, senior global macro strategist at State Street in Boston.\n\nSince mid-January the market has reduced rate cut expectations by 60 basis points for the Fed, the same for the Bank of Canada, 37 basis points for the ECB and 57 basis points for the Bank of England, he said.\n\n\"This change in the U.S. rates market is an economy that is performing in a way that we're not seeing in a lot of the other developed markets. Eventually you're going have to start seeing more separation,\" Loh said.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which reflects interest rate expectations, fell 7.6 basis points to 4.580%, while the yield on the benchmark 10-year note was down 4.1 basis points at 4.254%.\n\nGermany's 10-year Bund yield, which moves inversely to its price, was down 3.8 basis points at 2.373%, while the euro was 0.32% higher at $1.0814.\n\nThe euro zone's benchmark yield has risen around 35 bps so far this year as bumps in the road to lower inflation and better than feared economic data in most of the world, particularly the United States, has caused markets to push back their late-2023 expectations of significant rate cuts early this year.\n\nGermany's rate-sensitive two-year yield has risen 40 bps year to date.\n\nCHINESE RATE CUT\n\nChina's five-year loan prime rate was lowered by 25 basis points to 3.95%, bigger than the five to 15 bp cuts forecast by economists. The one-year rate was left at 3.45%, helping blue chips to finish the day up 0.2%, after an earlier fall, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index to rise 0.6%.\n\nThe yuan touched its lowest in three months in early trade before steadying at 7.1979 in the European morning.\n\nU.S. crude recently fell 0.42% to $78.86 per barrel and Brent was at $82.41, down 1.38% on the day.\n\n(Reporting by Herbert Lash; additional reporting by Alun John in London, Tom Westbrook in Singaoor; editing by Ros Russell, Chizu Nomiyama and Chris Reese)", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-markets-dollar-stocks-slip-172854454.html", "symbols": ["91D.F", "COMP.US", "NVD.BE", "NVD.DU", "NVD.F", "NVD.HA", "NVD.HM", "NVD.MU", "NVD.STU", "NVD.XETRA", "NVDA.MX", "NVDA.NEO", "NVDA.US", "NVDC34.SA", "NVDG.F"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": -0.777, "neg": 0.073, "neu": 0.863, "pos": 0.064}}, {"date": "2024-02-20T17:25:05+00:00", "title": "Goldman Sachs raises S&amp;P 500 target, Nvidia earnings: Top Stories", "content": "On the heels of the S&P 500 (^GSPC) surpassing 5,000 for the first time earlier this month, Goldman Sachs has raised its year-end forecast for the index to 5,200 amid an upbeat earnings outlook.

Goldman Sachs is boosting its year end target for the S&P 500 citing an improved earnings outlook. And we got a good gauge on the consumer from big box retailers Walmart and Home Depot this morning, it is all about Nvidia. Those results out after the closing bell on Wednesday and Rochelle, some interesting moves ahead of those results. Take a look at where Nvidia stock is trading today down about 5% right now.\n\nI mean, you could argue this is a stock that has been really priced for perfection blow blowout earnings over the last several quarters. Maybe a bit of profit taking happening there as well. And maybe investors getting a bit more cautious about whether, in fact NVIDIA can meet expectations. It's worth pointing out this specific number though from Vanda Research.\n\nNVIDIA trading volumes have made up an average of roughly 8% of daily trading volumes. That's more than Tesla at 7%. So that shows you how honed in investors are on this particular stock and we're going to get those results tomorrow, could be a big mover.\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: I mean, you have to figure, given all the hype going into this given its meteoric rise just over the past few years, ever since the generative AI boom continued to launch last year, so much seems to be riding on this earnings data. And if you actually look for the last seven years, NVIDIA has actually beaten on earnings per share estimates, sales estimates and raised guidance every quarter except for a revenue miss in 2019.\n\nAnd that was of course, even before what we've seen with the developments with generative AI. I mean, some of the pullback that we're seeing, as you mentioned perhaps some caution, perhaps some profit taking, perhaps a healthy pullback, considering stocks can't just go up and up and up because then you end up with a bubble.\n\nSo perhaps a bit of a pause here and obviously seeing some of the other chip makers falling in solidarity as well.

Tesla shares fell 3.9%.\n\n\"The sellout that we're seeing today is driven by the reversal in SMCI (Super Micro Computer) because a lot of hot money was chasing these AI names and then we had the vicious selloff on Friday,\" said Dennis Dick, a trader at Triple D Trading.\n\nShares in Super Micro Computer extended losses by 11.3%, after finishing down 20% on Friday as investors took a break from betting on the stock as a big beneficiary of strong AI technology demand.\n\nWalmart hit a record high and was last up 3.4% after the U.S. retail giant forecast fiscal 2025 sales largely above Wall Street expectations and raised its annual dividend by 9%. This helped cushion the impact on Dow Jones.\n\nThe S&P 500 consumer staples sector, which houses Walmart, rose 1.1%, while information technology dropped 1.8%.\n\nA weeks-long rally on Wall Street was stalled by hotter-than-expected U.S. inflation data last week that dampened market expectations for an imminent start to the Federal Reserve's easing cycle.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe rate cut is expected in June, according to a slim majority of economists polled by Reuters, who also flagged risk of a further delay in the first cut.\n\nInvestors are awaiting the release of minutes from the Fed's latest policy meeting as well as remarks from a slew of central bank officials later this week.\n\nAt 11:40 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 49.57 points, or 0.13%, at 38,578.42, the S&P 500 was down 32.50 points, or 0.65%, at 4,973.07, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 195.28 points, or 1.24%, at 15,580.37.\n\nSmart-TV maker Vizio jumped 14.9% after Walmart said it would buy the company for $2.3 billion.\n\nDiscover Financial Services surged 14.4% on Warren Buffett-backed consumer bank Capital One's plans to acquire the U.S. credit card issuer in a $35.3 billion deal.\n\nIntel added 0.6% following a report on Friday that the Biden administration is in talks to award more than $10 billion in subsidies to the semiconductor firm.\n\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.31-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and for a 1.63-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\n\nThe S&P index recorded 27 new 52-week highs and three new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 53 new highs and 65 new lows.\n\n(Reporting by Amruta Khandekar and Bansari Mayur Kamdar; Editing by Shinjini Ganguli)", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-stocks-nasdaq-leads-wall-171659127.html", "symbols": ["91D.F", "COMP.US", "NVD.BE", "NVD.DU", "NVD.F", "NVD.HA", "NVD.HM", "NVD.MU", "NVD.STU", "NVD.XETRA", "NVDA.MX", "NVDA.NEO", "NVDA.US", "NVDC34.SA", "NVDG.F", "SMCI.US", "WALM34.SA", "WMT.BA", "WMT.BE", "WMT.F"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.71, "neg": 0.066, "neu": 0.867, "pos": 0.067}}, {"date": "2024-02-20T17:00:05+00:00", "title": "Nvidia (NVDA) Is Up 0.67% in One Week: What You Should Know", "content": "Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be \"buying high, but hoping to sell even higher.\" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.\n\nEven though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.\n\nBelow, we take a look at Nvidia (NVDA), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of A. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.\n\nIt's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Nvidia currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.\n\nYou can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>\n\nSet to Beat the Market?\n\nLet's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for NVDA that show why this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence shows promise as a solid momentum pick.\n\nLooking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor NVDA, shares are up 0.67% over the past week while the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry is up 0.56% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 21.72% compares favorably with the industry's 3.08% performance as well.\n\nConsidering longer term price metrics, like performance over the last three months or year, can be advantageous as well. Shares of Nvidia have increased 50.52% over the past quarter, and have gained 239.5% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&P 500 has only moved 11.28% and 24.37%, respectively.\n\nInvestors should also take note of NVDA's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, NVDA is averaging 45,667,384 shares for the last 20 days.\n\nEarnings Outlook\n\nThe Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with NVDA.\n\nOver the past two months, 3 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost NVDA's consensus estimate, increasing from $12.29 to $12.34 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 3 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.\n\nBottom Line\n\nTaking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that NVDA is a #2 (Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of A. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep Nvidia on your short list.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Is now the time to buy Nvidia? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\n\nWhat is the market telling us:\n\nNvidia's shares are very volatile and over the last year have had 8 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today's move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 15 days ago, when the company gained 5.1% on the news that Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari raised the price target on the company's stock from $625 to $800, and maintained a Buy rating. The price target represented a potential 16% upside from where shares traded when the update was announced. The analyst added \"We believe Nvidia will remain as the industry gold standard for the foreseeable future, given its robust hardware and software offerings and, importantly, the pace at which it continues to innovate.\"\n\nNvidia is up 42.1% since the beginning of the year, and at $685.87 per share it is trading close to its 52-week high of $739 from February 2024.

In context of that, today's move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 4 days ago, when the stock dropped 22.3% on the news that the company reported fourth-quarter results and provided slightly underwhelming outlook for the coming quarters. The company lacked specificity that the market craves when discussing its full-year 2024 EBITDA forecast (it stated that EBITDA would be \"positive\" rather than sharing a number - Wall Street was expecting $100 million of EBITDA for 2024). Management cited challenging macroeconomic conditions and an uneven ad market recovery, and they anticipate seasonal revenue declines in line with Q1 2023, alongside tough year-over-year growth rate comparisons in streaming services distribution and a challenging media and entertainment landscape. Additionally, the company has averaged 8% upside to Wall Street's revenue estimates since Q3 2022, so Roku's more modest beat this quarter may be causing investors to level set with regards to expectations.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn a more positive note, Roku beat analysts' revenue expectations as it grew its user base and outperformed in its Platform and Devices segments. Its revenue guidance for next quarter also topped analysts' expectations. Overall, this quarter's results seemed mixed, but the market was likely expecting more.\n\nRoku is down 24.2% since the beginning of the year, and at $67.48 per share it is trading 36.9% below its 52-week high of $106.87 from November 2023. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Roku's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $1,258.\n\nToday\u2019s young investors likely haven\u2019t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy.

This further supports the narrative that inflation is cooling, likely giving the Fed more reasons to start cutting rates in 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlso, stocks continued to rally as the Nasdaq rose 1.2% and the S&P 500 gained 0.57% to end another strong week of earnings with positive results from most of the big tech stocks that reported so far this season.

Stifel currently holds the Magnificent Seven tech stock component at a Buy rating with an $865 per share price target.\n\nStifel Applied Technology Analyst Ruben Roy examines several of the top drivers expected to weigh on Nvidia earnings, including AI infrastructure and CPU product pipelines.\n\n\"It's an unlikely situation where we see sort of a miss and guide lower, but anything could happen, and certainly that would be taken as a meaningful negative, I would say, into the ecosystem of AI as we think about the broader companies that are involved here,\" Roy tells Yahoo Finance. \"Throughout earnings season, the news has been rather positive on this broadening of capital spending into a lot of other companies that will benefit from AI infrastructure.\"\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Luke Carberry Mogan.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nBRAD SMITH: If NVIDIA comes out and misses on this, what is potentially, a Goldilocks report, is that the rug pull on the broader markets, especially given how AI has fueled this rally?\n\nRUBEN ROY: That would be tough because, there's, obviously, a lot of expectations here. One of the things that we've been talking about with our tech team here at Stifel has been this concept of broadening of AI infrastructure spend. And we are starting to see that with things like AI networking. Companies that are exposed to interconnecting these GPU clusters, and then out into the rest of the data center and rest of the world.\n\nAnd those numbers have been going up, Brad. So I think it's an unlikely situation where we see a miss and got lower. But anything can happen. Certainly, that would be taken as a pretty meaningful negative, I would say, into the ecosystem of AI, as we think about the broader companies that are involved here.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut like I said, throughout earnings season, the news has been rather positive on this broadening of capital spending into a lot of other companies that will benefit from AI infrastructure\n\nSEANA SMITH: Ruben, you mentioned just a moment ago that GPU tech conference that's coming up next month, any idea-- just give us a sense just about what you think the pipeline updates is going to sound like or is going to look like, and what you think NVIDIA sees in terms of that growth opportunity, the TAM, the total addressable market, here for their chips in the longer term.\n\nRUBEN ROY: Yeah. It's a great question because I think that's really a focus area that we've been looking at, which is that NVIDIA is expanding their technologies that are coming into this area of spend. So not just the GPU hardware, not just the software that goes along with it or the networking products that are very necessary, but they're expanding. They started shipping a CPU for the first time into these types of deployments.\n\nSo they've got an ARM-based CPU. I think that the cadence of their technology coming to market is increasing. So instead of GPUs coming to market every two years, they're trying to increase that to potentially bring out new technologies every year.\n\nThey've got, as you folks might know, H100 and H200 are the leading edge of the GPUs that are going out into these AI infrastructure builds. Today, they've got a new set of technologies coming out that we expect to be launched later on this year, which we'll probably talk about.\n\nAnd so I think it's really that it's a question of expanding their technology that they're bringing to the table across both hardware and software, as well as the networking. And so I think that's going to be an important area for investors to focus on.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/video/nvidia-q4-earnings-results-could-163048016.html", "symbols": ["NVD.BE", "NVD.DU", "NVD.F", "NVD.HA", "NVD.HM", "NVD.MU", "NVD.STU", "NVD.XETRA", "NVDA.MX", "NVDA.NEO", "NVDA.US", "NVDC34.SA", "NVDG.F"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.995, "neg": 0.034, "neu": 0.854, "pos": 0.112}}, {"date": "2024-02-20T15:30:25+00:00", "title": "Cisco's Expanded Partnership With Nvidia Overshadowed By The \"Price\" It Has To Pay For Its AI And Cybersecurity Shift", "content": "Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ: CSCO) joined\u00a0Alphabet\u00a0(NASDAQ: GOOG),\u00a0Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN),Microsoft\u00a0Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) in entering 2024 with job cuts as it announced\u00a0it will be decreasing its workforce by 5% which implies eliminating about 4,250 jobs. Although Cisco reported it expanded its AI deployment and management\u00a0partnership with Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) earlier in February, its good news were dimmed by\u00a0a light forecast, both for the current quarter and the full year. By deepening the partnership with Nvidia, Cisco got to focus on data centers. Cisco and Nvidia will provide easy to deploy and manage\u00a0AI infrastructure solutions to data centers. Through their\u00a0purpose-built Ethernet networking-based solutions, Nvidia and Cisco promise to\u00a0enable\u00a0the massive computing power that companies need to make it in the AI era.\n\nCisco\u2019s Fiscal Second Quarter Highlights\n\nFor the quarter ended on January 27th\u00a0, Cisco reported that revenue\u00a0declined 6%\u00a0YoY.\u00a0Networking products\u00a0brought $7.08 billion, slightly below\u00a0StreetAccount\u2019s\u00a0$7.10 billion\u00a0consensus estimate.\n\nNet income also fell to $2.63 billion, with earnings per share falling 3%. Adjusted earnings amounted to\u00a087 cents, topping LSEG\u2019s estimate of\u00a084\u00a0cents.\n\nA Cautious Outlook Due To Macroeconomic Challenges\n\nCisco expects to\u00a0its\u00a0$28 billion acquisition of machine learning and cyber security software maker Splunk\u00a0during the current, third fiscal, quarter, or early in the second calendar, which is fiscal third, quarter. EU antitrust regulators have set March 13th\u00a0as a deadline to decide whether they\u2019ll clear Cisco\u2019s bid that would help reduce its reliance on its networking equipment business that has faced both a slowdown and supply chain challenges.\n\nFor the current, fiscal third, quarter,\u00a0Cisco guided for 84 to 86 cents in adjusted earnings per share\u00a0and revenue in the range between\u00a0$12.1 billion\u00a0and\u00a0$12.3 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs for the full fiscal year, Cisco guided for adjusted earnings between\u00a0$3.68\u00a0and\u00a0$3.74, and revenue between\u00a0$51.5 billion\u00a0and\u00a0$52.5 billion. However, this guidance does not account for the impact from Splunk.\n\nGetting Into AI Has Its Cost, And It\u2019s A\u00a0Hefty One\n\nConsidering that even Microsoft, Amazon and Google kicked off the new year by slashing staff, these layoffs clearly indicate tighter times for tech companies.\u00a0With tech companies pouring billions into AI development, Cisco merely followed suit and joined Microsoft, Amazon, Google, as well as PayPal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: PYPL) and Duolingo Inc (NASDAQ: DUOL), with Layoffs.fyi. estimating that\u00a034,000 tech employees have been laid off\u00a0year-to-date. In January, Google dismissed hundreds of employees from hardware and internal software divisions to reverse its pandemic hiring spree. Amazon announced targeted job cuts across its film and television studio, with Audible and Buy With Prime divisions also cutting 5% of their workforce. PayPal will be reducing its workforce count by 9% this year, after announcing a 7% cut last year. After its acquisition of Activision Blizzard that will undoubtedly strengthen its position in gaming, Microsoft needed to sacrifice about 8% of its video game staff which represent less than 1% of the tech titan\u2019s total workforce. Therefore, the internet networking pioneer, Cisco, is merely doing what everyone else is. Downsizing and\u00a0layoffs are merely the cost of focusing on key priorities and growth\u00a0areas such as AI.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.\n\nThat is because NVIDIA is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings \u2014 with the most up-to-date information possible \u2014 is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for NVDA in this report.\n\nIn fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $4.71 per share for NVDA, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.54 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for NVDA, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +3.67% heading into earnings season.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation Price and EPS Surprise NVIDIA Corporation Price and EPS Surprise\n\nNVIDIA Corporation price-eps-surprise | NVIDIA Corporation Quote\n\nWhy is this Important?\n\nA positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).\n\nGiven that NVDA has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nClearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for NVIDIA, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

At the time, analysts really liked its stock \u2013 19 out of 20 rated it a Buy, with a target price of $98.50 \u2013 and I like the fact that its price-to-free cash flow was only 6.68.

Khoury, who hails from Lebanon, worked at Cypress for 13 years, becoming its CEO in August 2016.\n\nWhile its corporate name is ON Semiconductor, it operates under the Onsemi brand, which generated $8.3 billion in revenue and $2.26 billion in non-GAAP income in 2023.\n\nBetween 2024 and 2027, it plans to grow its revenue by 11% compounded annually at the midpoint of its guidance, with annual free cash flow of $3.75 billion in 2027 \u2013 it was $402 million in 2023, down from $1.63 billion, due to a 50% increase in capital expenditures toward its future growth \u2013 which should lead to a much higher share price.\n\nOf the 34 analysts covering its stock, 19 rate it a Buy, with a target price of $90.00, 14% higher than where it\u2019s currently trading.\n\nMark Zuckerberg, Meta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt\u2019s hard to believe but Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg will only turn 40 this May.\n\nHe is the fourth wealthiest person on the planet with a net worth of $170 billion. In 2024, alone, his wealth increased by nearly $42 billion, more than double Nvidia\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO and co-founder Jensen Huang. Zuckerberg has been CEO since founding the company in 2004.\n\nThere is no question that Meta\u2019s revival over the past year \u2013 its stock is up 175% over the past 52 weeks \u2013 is one of the most significant turnarounds in recent history.

In 2023, it had an operating profit of $46.75 billion on $134.90 billion in revenue, 500 basis points lower than in 2021.\n\nHowever, when you consider how far it fell in 2022, the rebound is astounding. Further, it\u2019s got plenty of irons in the fire to keep driving revenue and operating profits higher.\n\nNow, if it could only get its Reality Labs business making money, he\u2019d soon become the world\u2019s wealthiest person.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Bitcoin breached the $52,000 mark on Feb 15 and has since then held on to it. The world\u2019s most popular cryptocurrency has gained more than 25% this year after a solid 2023.\n\nBitcoin Poised to Surge\n\nThere are several reasons behind Bitcoin\u2019s recent rally. However, the biggest factor has been the January approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs. In one of the most important events in the history of Bitcoin, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), in a major reform, approved 11 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in early January.\n\nThe crypto rally gained momentum in the final months of 2023 on expectations that the SEC would give a green signal anytime. The cryptocurrency declined sharply in the last weeks of January, falling as much as $39,000. However, the positive sentiment is back.\n\nThe spot Bitcoin ETF approval was given with the aim to push cryptocurrencies into mainstream finance, which would give a long-term boost to the cryptocurrency space.\n\nIn a significant development, data from CryptoQuant indicates that spot Bitcoin ETFs have garnered $10 billion in assets under management (AUM) since their launch on Jan 10, reflecting the growing investor interest.\n\nBesides, Bitcoin\u2019s upcoming halving event is expected in April, which is likely to halve the mining reward for new blocks. Historically, this event has heightened scarcity, creating challenges for miners to acquire net Bitcoins. As a result, there tends to be an increase in Bitcoin's value due to the constrained supply.\n\nStocks to Watch\n\nNVIDIA Corporation NVDA is a major player in the semiconductor industry and has been one of the standout success stories of 2023. As a leading designer of graphic processing units (GPUs), the value of the NVDA stock tends to surge in a thriving crypto market. This is primarily due to the crucial role that GPUs play in data centers, artificial intelligence, and the mining or production of cryptocurrencies.\n\nStory continues\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 269.5%.

In fact, the S&P 500 topped the major milestone of 5,000 for the first time ever earlier this month.\r\n\r\nAs such, we have highlighted five stocks from the S&P 500 that have gained more than 25% halfway through the first quarter and have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy), or #3 (Hold). These are Nvidia NVDA, Eli Lilly and Company LLY, Meta Platforms META, Uber Technologies, Inc UBER and Ralph Lauren Corp. RL.

Of the companies that reported results, 79.1% beat EPS estimates and 65.1% surpassed revenue estimates. The pace of earnings and revenue growth represents an acceleration from the last couple of quarters, with the technology sector being a major contributor to this improving trend. Notably, the earnings growth is the best growth rate for the S&P 500 companies since the 6.5% earnings growth rate in the first quarter of 2022.\r\n\r\nThe resilience of the U.S. economy has played a crucial role in the stock market ascent, although it has reduced the likelihood of a near-term rate cut. Factors like robust retail sales, consumer sentiment and a cooling trend in the producer price index indicate the possibility of the Fed achieving a soft landing, bringing inflation back to target without triggering a recession. This economic resilience, coupled with surging shares of big technology companies and optimism over artificial intelligence, has been a significant driver of the market's upward trajectory.\n\nBest-Performing Stocks\n\nNvidia is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of graphic processing unit or GPU.

Generative AI, powered by large language models, can create diverse content types, including text, imagery, audio and synthetic data. This technology is poised to revolutionize various industries by modernizing workflows.\n\nAccording to Fortune Business Insights, the global generative AI market is projected to reach $667.96 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 47.5% from 2023 to 2030. ChatGPT's adoption by enterprises has demonstrated its utility across sectors such as marketing, customer service, healthcare and more.\n\nHowever, leveraging generative AI requires substantial computational power and expertise, prompting enterprises to upgrade their infrastructure. NVIDIA's next-generation chips, renowned for their high computing capabilities, are well-suited for this task. CEO Jensen Huang highlighted the inadequacy of existing data centers for handling AI workloads during NVIDIA's first-quarter fiscal 2024 earnings call.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs NVIDIA's GPUs find applications in AI models across industries like automotive, healthcare and manufacturing, the demand for its high-powered chips is expected to surge further. NVIDIA anticipates robust revenue growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, reaching $20 billion, driven by increased AI investments in the data center end market.\n\nZacks Rank & Other Stocks to Consider\n\nNVIDIA currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Thus, there\u2019s no shortage of high-priced tech stocks at the moment. While it\u2019s easy to find tech shares that are high priced, finding untapped gems becomes that much harder.\n\nTech stocks have soared over the past year as the artificial intelligence era begins. The Magnificent 7 have been the primary beneficiaries of that boom. Their success has pulled up many other tech stocks. However, there are plenty of hidden gems yet to be discovered along with some better known big name firms.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at seven tech stocks that appear to be oversold values currently.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlibaba (BABA) Alibaba (BABA) logo on the side of a glass-walled building.\n\nSource: testing / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvestors continue to be bearish about Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) stock in early 2024. What was once one of the highest flying Chinese tech stocks is now a little more than a contrarian pick. Well, that\u2019s the prevailing market wisdom regarding the e-commerce giant. It\u2019s also wisdom that investors should ignore.\n\nThe Chinese stock market continues to be historically weak. In fact, ETfs Tracking country performance are at Lowe\u2019s last tested in 2011. Investors aren\u2019t particularly keen on Chinese Equity at the moment overall. That said, certain e-commerce competitors of Alibaba, namely PDD Holdings (NASDAQ:PDD), look strong primarily due to Temu.\n\nThat has made Alibaba and its shares look even weaker as investors wonder whether it\u2019s time as China\u2019s e-commerce Champion is a thing of the past. That has yet to be determined. What is known at the moment is that Alibaba\u2019s revenues grew by 5% in the most recent quarter.\n\nIt remains the leading cloud firm in China. Those factors have started to sway sentiment with several big names establishing positions in Alibaba. The tide is turning in Alibaba\u2019s favor and now is the time to get on board.\n\nTeradyne (TER) Close-up Presentation of a New Generation Microchip. Gloved Hand Holding Piece of Technological Wonder. Semiconductor stocks are in the news.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThe semiconductor sector is heating up, making Teradyne (NASDAQ:TER)\u00a0one of the tech stocks primed for a breakout.\n\nStory continues\n\nBullishness pervades the sector following news from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) that it expects sales to increase by 20% in 2024. Teradyne produces testing equipment vital to the industry and it should be pulled up because of the news.\n\nAt least, that\u2019s what one would expect. However, Teradyne continues to face a downturn. Its most recent earnings showed revenues declined by 8%. The company continues to forecast weak demand. The reason is simple: market uncertainty. Firms simply don\u2019t have the confidence to assume that the economy will continue to improve. Thus, they are holding back on chip testing equipment purchases for the moment.\n\nWhat then should give investors any reason to establish a contrarian position?\u00a0 One of the strongest reasons is that Teradyne may have a big opportunity in the US. The company pulled $1 billion worth of equipment out of China due to export controls in 2023. TSM strongly believes that the US chip sector will grow in 2024. Teradyne can make up those losses by pivoting into US strength.\n\nMicrochip Technology (MCHP) Microchip (MCHP) logo at HQ in Silicon Valley. Microchip Technology Inc. manufactures microcontrollers, mixed-signal, analog and Flash-IP integrated circuits\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrochip Technology (NASDAQ:MCHP) provides integrated circuits, more specifically, microcontrollers and microprocessors.\n\nBoth types of chips contain CPUs with microcontrollers also including memory and power on one integrated chip. That overly technical explanation aside, Microchip Technology is a stock worth considering.\n\nThe company is extremely profitable with Margins and Returns on assets and Equity that outpace roughly 95% of competitors in the semiconductor sector. Despite the company\u2019s strong performance, it continues to trade more cheaply than 65% of its competitors based on its price-to-earnings ratio.\n\nThe company also released a security oriented chip in late 2023 which makes it more relevant overall. firms everywhere are increasingly concerned about security issues in the AI era. Demand for increased security and connected devices is unsurprisingly increasing because of artificial intelligence.\n\nThe company is looking to rebound in 2024 on weaker sales. It is attempting to do so through share buybacks and dividend payouts which is another reason to consider it.\n\nSTMicroelectronics (STM) STMicroelectronics building\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvestors don\u2019t have to dig deep to find a reason STMicroelectronics (NYSE:STM)\u00a0stock remains undervalued.\n\nOne of STMicroelectronics primary revenue generators is the sale of chips to automotive manufacturers and the broader automotive industry. A big reason then for its current troubles is simply that the electric vehicle industry is going through a downturn. EVs require many more chips than do their internal combustion counterparts, thus resulting in trouble for STMicroelectronics.\n\nThere\u2019s a belief that STMicroelectronics is oversold because of skepticism about the EV sector\u2019s recovery. Sales growth is anticipated to continue to slow in 2024 as the sector attempts to move from the early adopter phase into the mass market.\n\nYet, newer chemistries will continue to drive down the costs of battery production. In turn, that could galvanize a resurgence in growth. Whether or not factors become more positive in 2024 remains to be seen.\n\nSTMicroelectronics should keep growing and will break out sooner or later as the tide around electric vehicles shifts again.\n\nSoundHound AI (SOUN) In this photo illustration, the SoundHound logo seen displayed on a smartphone. SOUN stock\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nSoundHound AI (NASDAQ:SOUN) stock increased in price dramatically following news that Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has invested in the firm.\n\nNvidia disclosed that it has invested $3.7 million in the company which engages in conversational AI development. It was among the smaller investments Nvidia made with a $76 million investment in a biotech firm and a $147.3 million investment in Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM).\n\nDespite its relatively small size, the disclosure of the investment served to raise SoundHound AI\u2019s share price by more than 60%.\n\nThe best time to have been invested in SoundHound AI was clearly prior to the disclosure of the news. Yet, it continues to be a sound investment and is among the leading names in conversational AI. Nvidia\u2019s investment in SoundHound AI strongly suggests that it believes the firm is the leading company in the emergent space.\n\nCisco Systems (CSCO) A Cisco (CSCO) sign outside of a building.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nCisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO)Is another very well known Tech stock to investors. Thus, it\u2019s hard to characterize it as being untapped. further, the company is going through a restructuring that will result in headcount declining by 5%.\n\nThe company is dealing with a glut of inventory at the companies it serves. It will take time for those buyers to work through inventory, which will slow down sales at the company. That news sets the stage for a few positive things to happen.\n\nMany companies have moved higher because of restructuring over the past year. It is entirely possible that the markets receive the news positively. Labor costs are the highest expense for firms and in that regard, Cisco Systems just improved.\n\nAnother reason to buy Cisco Systems now is the potential for higher dividend yields if shares keep falling. With a dividend yield of over 3%, it\u2019s a strong income choice among tech stocks. The bargain is improving, another reason to consider Cisco Systems now.\n\nGlobal Payments (GPN) Global Payments office building in Brantford, Ontario, Canada. GPN stock.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock\n\nGlobal Payments (NYSE:GPN) Is a fintech stock with momentum on its side. The Atlanta-based company just released earnings which were overall quite positive.\n\nRevenues increased by 8%, reaching $2.43 billion in the fourth quarter. Diluted earnings increased by 50% during the same period and the company\u2019s operating margin increased by 2.4%. Clearly there\u2019s a lot to like. The strong results are one of the primary reasons that share prices have increased from $127 to $137 year to date.\n\nCFO Josh Whipple noted that the company\u2019s outlook for 2024 continues to foresee strong momentum though it has been tempered by recent economic uncertainty. That was a nod to headline inflation numbers which continue to confound economists.\n\nRegardless, the fintech opportunity continues to be strong as the traditional finance and banking sector further digitizes in 2024 and beyond. Income investors will also appreciate the fact that Global Payments includes a dividend. That dividend yields a modest 0.75% that will add up over time.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The chipmaker's stock has already surged nearly 50% so far this year.\n\nThat rally could ease if Nvidia warns again that U.S. curbs on selling its chips to China are hurting its business and visibility into long-term prospects, and if it is unable to sort out supply shortages at its chip contractor TSMC.\n\nIn response to the newest round of U.S. export rules, Nvidia has come up with new products for the Chinese market, but there is a risk that those chips will also be banned like its first round of China market chips.\n\n\"There's an understanding that China is going to go its own way,\" said Angus Shillington, a portfolio manager at wealth manager VanEck, referring to the country's efforts to make its own chips. VanEck's Semiconductor ETF held more than $151 million worth of Nvidia stock as of Jan. 31.\n\nChina accounted for more than a fifth of Nvidia's revenue in the third quarter.\n\nUltimately though, red-hot demand for Nvidia's graphic processing units - which are powering an AI upgrade at massive datacenters around the world - could trump all concerns.\n\n\"Given the hot demand situation, Nvidia should comfortably be able to replace China demand with other governments as well as large enterprises,\" Tejas Dessai, an analyst at exchange traded fund (ETF) provider Global X told Reuters. Global X's Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF held roughly $500 million worth of Nvidia stock as of Feb. 13.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Santa Clara, California-based company is also likely to forecast on Wednesday another 200% year-over-year increase in revenue for its first quarter ending April, according to LSEG data.\n\nMorgan Stanley analysts said in a note they expect Nvidia to top that expectation by 25%, thanks to aggressive orders, and Goldman Sachs said it expects major supplier TSMC to increase chip packaging capacity through the first half of the year.\n\nDemand for advanced packaging was very strong and TSMC couldn't offer enough capacity to support customers, a bottleneck that would continue into next year, the Taiwanese company said in January. It is planning to invest nearly $2.87 billion in a plant, as it looks to double its packaging capacity.\n\n\"The reason why (Nvidia) can't beat (estimates) by more is the capacity needs. That is what's holding them back. Otherwise there could have been a larger beat,\" said Inge Heydorn, a partner at investment firm G.P. Bullhound, which holds Nvidia shares.\n\nLast May, Nvidia stunned investors by forecasting revenue for the May-July period nearly 54% above analysts' expectations, igniting a rally in AI-facing stocks. Since then, the company's forecasts have surprised analysts, but to a smaller degree.\n\nVanEck's Shillington said he does not expect that magnitude of a surprise, and that Nvidia would be foolish to rely on China demand.\n\nFor the first three quarters of 2023, Nvidia had reported quarterly revenue that beat analysts' estimates by between 10% and 20%.\n\n(Reporting by Arsheeya Bajwa in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by Sayantani Ghosh)", "link": "https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidias-surging-growth-may-still-112033069.html", "symbols": ["NVD.BE", "NVD.DU", "NVD.F", "NVD.HA", "NVD.HM", "NVD.MU", "NVD.STU", "NVD.XETRA", "NVDA.MX", "NVDA.NEO", "NVDA.US", "NVDC34.SA", "NVDG.F"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.99, "neg": 0.05, "neu": 0.847, "pos": 0.102}}, {"date": "2024-02-20T11:15:00+00:00", "title": "Should You Buy Nvidia Stock Before Thursday?", "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) boom will get another big test this week.\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), the chipmaker that has become the flag-bearer for the generative AI revolution, will report fourth-quarter earnings after hours on Wednesday, and you can bet Wall Street will be standing by with rapt attention.\n\nAfter all, Nvidia is now up nearly 400% since the start of 2023 and has gained 46% this year alone as its hardware has helped lead the artificial intelligence charge after ChatGPT was launched. Nvidia recently passed Amazon and Alphabet to become the third-most valuable U.S. company with a market cap of $1.8 trillion, behind only Microsoft and Apple.\n\nNvidia has become the bellwether for the AI boom, so it's only natural to speculate about its upcoming earnings report. Is it the right move to buy the AI stock before its fourth-quarter numbers come out? Let's take a look at the available evidence to see the best decision. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhat to expect from Nvidia on Wednesday\n\nNvidia has seen extraordinary demand for its GPUs, accelerators, and other chips that are well suited to run the kind of AI models that make programs like ChatGPT work, and Wall Street has had trouble keeping up with the surge in demand for Nvidia's products.\n\nThe chip titan has breezed past Wall Street estimates and typically gives guidance well ahead of the consensus. Wall Street estimates have steadily floated higher for Nvidia in recent months.\n\nFor the fourth quarter, analysts expect revenue to skyrocket 237% to $20.4 billion, and see earnings per share jumping from $0.88 to $4.56.\n\nThose are lofty expectations, but they aren't unwarranted. In its third quarter, Nvidia's revenue soared by 206% to $18.1 billion, and it forecast revenue of around $20 billion in the fourth quarter.\n\nNvidia's partners have smashed estimates\n\nThere's also evidence that the AI boom is still picking up speed based on reports from some of Nvidia's partners.\n\nArm (NASDAQ: ARM) shares soared after it showed off accelerating revenue growth in its recent earnings report and touted a surge in AI-related demand. Arm licenses its CPU technology to Nvidia, and Arm designs are featured in Nvidia products like the Grace Hopper H200 Superchip, which is a more advanced version of the hugely popular H100 GPU that's been at the center of the AI boom.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdditionally, Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) shares have gone parabolic since the company reported preliminary results in January that were well ahead of expectations as its revenue doubled in the quarter. The company makes high-density servers and storage solutions that have been in high demand for their AI capabilities, and they run on Nvidia GPUs. Supermicro stock has surged 182% year to date and is up nearly 900% since the start of 2023.\n\nBoth of those earnings reports would bode well for Nvidia's update because Arm, Supermicro, and Nvidia are all benefiting from the same trends.\n\nShould you buy Nvidia now or wait until after earnings?\n\nIf you're buying a stock, it's best to plan to hold it for at least a year, which offers tax benefits and the advantage of smoothing out the volatility inherent in the stock market.\n\nAs Benjamin Graham said, \"In the short run, the market is a voting machine, but in the long run, it's a weighing machine.\" It's easier to be right on a stock's \"weight\" than its popularity, which helps give an advantage to long-term investors.\n\nIt's impossible to know for certain whether Nvidia will go up or down on its earnings report. But if you're buying the stock, you should be buying it because you believe it has sustainable competitive advantages that will enable it to continue to dominate the market for GPUs and AI chips, and use that as leverage to enter new markets such as PCs, which it recently announced plans to do.\n\nThere's no shortage of euphoria for Nvidia or other stocks with AI exposure, and several small-cap stocks recently skyrocketed when Nvidia revealed that it had taken small stakes in those companies.\n\nHowever, the recent surges from Arm and Supermicro indicate the market still seems to be underestimating the potential for AI hardware stocks like Nvidia. If I had to venture a guess, I'd say the stock is more likely to go up than down on the earnings report, and the options market is betting on that as well.\n\nBeyond earnings, Nvidia's competitive advantages seem to be strengthening, and demand for AI applications is likely to expand for the next several years, which will drive demand for its chips.\n\nEven after its monster rally, the stock looks like a smart long-term buy heading into earnings.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

One of them, British-registered and Lebanese-managed Rubymar cargo vessel in the Gulf of Aden, was in danger of sinking, according to Houthis -- raising stakes in their campaign to hit shipping in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.\n\nCanada releases its January inflation numbers into that scenario later too.\n\nThe cloudier inflation picture also comes alongside poor U.S. retail and industrial soundings for last month. WalMart and Home Depot results later on Tuesday may give a reality check on the former and to what extent freezing January weather distorted sales data.\n\nBut bracing for two and 20-year debt auctions on Wednesday, Treasury yields slipped back a touch from the year's highs ahead of Tuesday's open - with China's latest monetary easing greeting the new week.\n\nStory continues\n\nChina's central bank surprised many with the size of the 25bp cut to mortgage references rates earlier, even though fragile markets remained slightly underwhelmed by the authorities' efforts to stimulate credit and revive the ailing property market.\n\nThe blue-chip CSI300 index notched a sixth straight daily gain - broken by the lunar new year holiday - but its advance on Tuesday was a paltry 0.2%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng benchmark did a little better and rose 0.6%.\n\nDespite the rate cut, the offshore yuan appreciated slightly - though it was laced once again with suspicion of state-back buying. The dollar was more mixed elsewhere - a touch higher on the yen but lower on the euro.\n\nOn the other hand, China optimists cling to more upbeat lending and tourism data that show signs of domestic demand re-emerging.\n\nBut a potential crackdown in the financial sector will keep markets on edge.

One of them, British-registered and Lebanese-managed Rubymar cargo vessel in the Gulf of Aden, was in danger of sinking, according to Houthis -- raising stakes in their campaign to hit shipping in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.\n\nCanada releases its January inflation numbers into that scenario later too.\n\nThe cloudier inflation picture also comes alongside poor U.S. retail and industrial soundings for last month. WalMart and Home Depot results later on Tuesday may give a reality check on the former and to what extent freezing January weather distorted sales data.\n\nBut bracing for two and 20-year debt auctions on Wednesday, Treasury yields slipped back a touch from the year's highs ahead of Tuesday's open - with China's latest monetary easing greeting the new week.\n\nStory continues\n\nChina's central bank surprised many with the size of the 25bp cut to mortgage references rates earlier, even though fragile markets remained slightly underwhelmed by the authorities' efforts to stimulate credit and revive the ailing property market.\n\nThe blue-chip CSI300 index notched a sixth straight daily gain - broken by the lunar new year holiday - but its advance on Tuesday was a paltry 0.2%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng benchmark did a little better and rose 0.6%.\n\nDespite the rate cut, the offshore yuan appreciated slightly - though it was laced once again with suspicion of state-back buying. The dollar was more mixed elsewhere - a touch higher on the yen but lower on the euro.\n\nOn the other hand, China optimists cling to more upbeat lending and tourism data that show signs of domestic demand re-emerging.\n\nBut a potential crackdown in the financial sector will keep markets on edge.

Some strategists believe anything short of a blowout report could reverse a rally that has sent Nvidia's stock soaring 47% in 2024.\n\nAbout $30 billion worth of Nvidia shares changed hands daily on average over the past 30 sessions, pulling ahead of Elon Musk's electric car maker, which averaged $22 billion per day over the same period.\n\nTesla since 2020 had dominated daily U.S. stock trading, according to LSEG data, with turnover -- a stock's share price multiplied by the number of shares exchanged -- peaking above $35 billion several times in recent years.\n\nOn Friday, combined trading in Nvidia and Super Micro Computer, another company benefiting from the boom in AI, accounted for over 40% of all turnover of the 10 most traded U.S. stocks, including Tesla, Meta Platforms, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft.\n\n\"There's an argument here that this is the dawn of a new era of trading, like the dawn of the internet, with Nvidia in the pole position,\" said Dennis Dick, a trader at Triple D Trading in Ontario, Canada.\n\nBut Dick also warned that sky-high turnover in AI-related stocks suggests retail investors and algorithmic traders are driving share prices higher based on momentum rather than fundamentals, such as expectations of future revenue growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nSuper Micro, which sells AI-related server components to Nvidia, has seen its value more than triple to $45 billion so far in 2024. It tumbled 20% from record highs on Friday after Wells Fargo started covering the stock with an equal weight rating, saying its valuation already discounts \"solid upside\".\n\nNvidia controls about 80% of the high-end AI chip market, and last week its market capitalization eclipsed, separately, Amazon's and Alphabet's to make it Wall Street's third-most valuable company, behind Microsoft and Apple.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: CleanSpark CLSK, Nvidia NVDA, Advanced Micro Devices AMD, Marathon Digital Holdings MARA and Iris Energy IREN.\n\nHere are highlights from Friday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\n5 Crypto Stocks Riding the Hot Bitcoin Rally This Year\n\nBitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, has reclaimed its market cap to more than $1 trillion for the first time in two years. The crypto has surged past $52,000, gaining nearly 25% so far this year on the back of a fresh wave of investors\u2019 interest in tokens.\n\nWith the digital asset rally, cryptocurrency stocks also surged. We have presented five top-performing stocks that have been leading the rally in the cryptocurrency space this year. These are CleanSpark, Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, Marathon Digital Holdings and Iris Energy.\n\nInside the Surge in Bitcoin\n\nThe launch of Spot Bitcoin ETFs in January has been acting as the major catalyst for the bitcoin surge as it has made it easier for investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly owning the asset, thereby underscoring growth of cryptocurrency in mainstream investment platforms.\n\nIn a milestone, data from CryptoQuant revealed that spot Bitcoin ETFs have accumulated $10 billion in assets under management (AUM) since their inception on Jan 10 this year, reflecting a strong investor interest. Outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which previously dampened market sentiment, have significantly reduced, further fueling the upward trajectory. Notably, spot Bitcoin ETFs are a game changer for cryptocurrency investors.\n\nARK Invest, renowned for its optimistic outlook, envisions Bitcoin as a successor to gold as a secure asset, forecasting continued value growth, driven by its increasing integration into the financial ecosystem. It argues that Bitcoin's resilience to economic uncertainties like inflation and interest rate hikes positions it favorably in the current economic environment.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe anticipation of bitcoin's upcoming halving event in April is also influencing the cryptocurrency market. Halving, which reduces the reward for mining new blocks, has historically been seen as a catalyst for bitcoin's price. Moreover, the Lunar New Year holidays are contributing to a generally positive sentiment toward bitcoin, according to Fundstrat Global Advisors.\n\nStocks to Consider\n\nCleanSpark is engaged in the mining of cryptocurrencies. It owns and operates data centers that primarily run on low-carbon power. The stock has gained about 56% this year and has an estimated earnings growth rate of 81.4% for the fiscal year ending September 2024.\n\nCLSK currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a Momentum Score of B.

The stock has jumped about 47% this year. It has an estimated growth of 64.4% for the fiscal year ending January 2025.\n\nNvidia has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Growth Score of A at present.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices offers the industry\u2019s broadest portfolio of leadership high-performance and adaptive processor technologies. Its products are used for Bitcoin mining and other cryptocurrencies. AMD has also participated in cryptocurrency development. The stock has risen 20% so far this year.\n\nAMD currently has an estimated earnings growth rate of 30.9% for this year and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nMarathon Digital is a digital asset technology company, which mines cryptocurrencies, with a focus on the blockchain ecosystem and the generation of digital assets.

It builds, owns and operates data center infrastructure with a focus on entry into regions, wherein it can access abundant and/or under-utilized renewable energy to power its operations. The stock has gained 8% so far this year.\n\nIris Energy has an estimated earnings growth rate of 100.3% for the fiscal year ending June 2024.

At the moment, nothing is garnering the attention of professional and everyday investors quite like artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nAI, which involves the use of software and systems to oversee tasks normally overseen by humans, has application across almost every sector and industry. This is likely why the analysts at PwC believe AI has the potential to add $15.7 trillion to global gross domestic product by 2030. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia has become the infrastructure backbone of the AI revolution\n\nOver the past year, megacap Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has led the charge among artificial intelligence stocks. It's become the infrastructure backbone of the AI movement. The company's A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) are the brains of high-compute data centers that allow for split-second decision-making by AI software and systems.\n\nSince 2023 began, shares of Nvidia have nearly quintupled in value, with the company closing in on $1.5 trillion in added market cap, all thanks to AI. With enterprise demand particularly high for the company's AI-accelerated chips and supply still short, Nvidia has enjoyed exceptionally strong pricing power, which has driven most of its sales increase.\n\nBut with Nvidia shares closing at $726 last week, the prospect of a stock split may begin to look all the more enticing.\n\nA \"stock split\" is an event that allows a publicly traded company to alter both its share price and outstanding share count without having any impact on its market cap or operating performance. Think of it as a purely cosmetic change that can either make a company's shares more nominally affordable for everyday investors, as with a forward-stock split, or can increase a company's share price to ensure continued listing on a major exchange, as with a reverse-stock split. Nvidia would be looking at its second forward split in the past three years.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, Nvidia isn't the only high-flying AI or AI-related stock that appears primed for a potential stock split. What follows are three AI companies that could beat this GPU juggernaut to the punch and become Wall Street's next stock-split stocks. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nThe first artificial intelligence stock that could beat Nvidia to the punch and become Wall Street's next stock-split stock is none other than social media juggernaut Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META). Meta has never conducted a stock split, but its share price climbed to near $490 this past week.\n\nMeta is using AI in a variety of ways across its various products. In addition to helping with search and weeding out noncompliant posts made on its social media platforms, it's leaning heavily on generative AI to help businesses tailor their ads to users.\n\nMany of the investments Meta is making in AI and virtual/augmented reality probably won't result in a sizable increase in sales for years. In the meantime, it continues to generate almost 98% of its revenue from advertising. The company's social media real estate, which includes Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and Threads, is tops in the world, with nearly 4 billion collective monthly active users in the December-ended quarter. Meta should have no trouble commanding exceptional ad-pricing power more often than not.\n\nSomething else to note about Meta Platforms is that it's a cash-flow machine. It generated more than $71 billion in net cash from operations last year, and it closed out 2023 with over $61 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. This treasure chest is what allows CEO Mark Zuckerberg the luxury of taking risks, which includes the development of Meta's own AI chips.\n\nSuper Micro Computer\n\nA second AI-fueled company that can become Wall Street's next stock-split stock well ahead of Nvidia is server and storage-solutions specialist Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI). Like Meta Platforms, Super Micro has never conducted a stock split. However, with its stock briefly surpassing $1,000 per share last week, a forward split is probably in consideration.\n\nSuper Micro Computer's more-than-doubling in sales this year is a function of its highly customizable and energy-efficient rack-scale servers being in high demand. It's also a reflection of the company relying on Nvidia's AI-powered GPUs in its products. Businesses wanting to harness AI to expand their long-term growth potential and reach are increasingly turning to Super Micro.\n\nWhat remains to be seen is if Super Micro Computer can hold onto its nearly exponential returns over the past couple of weeks. Shares ended the previous week up 183% on a year-to-date basis, and are up 878% since the start of 2023. Historically, every next-big-thing investment over the past 30 years has endured an initial bubble. This is to say that investors have a terrible habit of overestimating the uptake of new technologies or innovations. AI will likely share this fate.\n\nThe other challenge for Super Micro is going to be whether or not it can maximize demand for its rack-scale solutions in AI-accelerated data centers. Since Super Micro relies on Nvidia's GPUs, it's at the mercy of its suppliers. But if Super Micro can somehow meet or surpass Wall Street's already lofty growth expectations, a stock split could well be in the cards.\n\nBroadcom\n\nThe third artificial intelligence stock that could leapfrog Nvidia and become one of Wall Street's next stock-split stocks is semiconductor giant Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO). Before Avago acquired Broadcom in 2016 and kept its name, Broadcom had completed three splits. But Avago had never split its stock. As of Feb. 16, a single share of Broadcom was setting shareholders back a whopping $1,245.\n\nBroadcom is approaching AI inclusion a couple of ways. It's added AI features to its Trident networking processors, and in April 2023 introduced its Jericho3-AI chip for AI networks. Jericho3 is integral for high-performance data centers in that it's designed to connect up to 32,000 GPUs. In short, it's designed to handle increasingly faster workloads in enterprise data centers.\n\nOne factor that's definitely worked in Broadcom's favor is its juicy backlog. Although CEO Hock Tan failed to provide an update on Broadcom's backlog in fiscal 2023 (the company's fiscal year ends in late September), the company totaled a record backlog of $31 billion in mid-2022. Wall Street and investors love large backlogs, because it typically leads to highly predictable operating cash flow.\n\nBut something investors should keep in mind is that Broadcom is generating a significant percentage of its revenue from wireless chips and accessories used in smartphones. While this segment should continue to deliver modest growth and plenty of cash flow for Broadcom, it could, ultimately, hold back the company's overall growth rate given how large of a role it plays in net sales.\n\nWith one of the highest nominal-dollar share prices on Wall Street, Broadcom is a logical candidate to split its stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.

Since the beginning of last year, shares of the advanced semiconductor company are up nearly 400%.\n\nOne Wall Street analyst thinks there's still plenty of upside for Nvidia, too. Ananda Baruah from Loop Capital has initiated coverage with a buy rating and $1,200 price target. That's the highest of all analysts covering the stock, and it represents a 65% gain from where shares trade as of this writing.\n\nAnd remember Nvidia was trading below $120 per share as recently as Oct. 2022.\n\nWhat makes a stock jump fivefold in just over a year?\n\nThe explosion in spending on high-end AI chips that boost computing power hasn't just been a surprise to analysts and investors but to the company itself.\n\nIn May 2023, Nvidia beat its fiscal Q1 revenue guidance by about $700 million. But that was just the beginning: Over the next two quarters, actual revenue exceeded management's guidance by at least $2 billion each time.\n\nDemand for AI chips has Nvidia's data center business growing faster than the company itself can keep up with. All eyes will be on the fiscal 2024 year-end report due Feb. 21 to see if the company once again beats what's already a record $20 billion quarterly revenue outlook.\n\nThe highest price target on Wall Street\n\nLoop Capital thinks the company will continue to surprise investors as Nvidia sells all of the advanced chips it can make for several more years. The firm's $1,200 price target implies a trailing-12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 158.\n\nBut align Loop's forward-looking price target and Nvidia's earnings estimates, and that valuation drops quickly. Analysts expect the company to report $20.41 in earnings per share in fiscal 2025, giving the company a forward P/E ratio of 59. That's still a premium to the market, but it's a much more reasonable price tag for long-term investors who want a piece of this AI leader.\n\nStory continues\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

There's a very good chance that AI will have as large an impact on our future as the industrial revolution or widespread adoption of the internet did.\n\nAs machines get smarter and we are better able to automate tasks that either used to be impossible or required major human intervention, there's no telling what new capabilities will arise. Even with that reality, there's one artificial intelligence stock I wouldn't touch with a 10-foot pole right now. That stock is actually one that has been among the biggest winners of the AI revolution so far, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). Image source: Getty Images\n\nHave I lost my mind?\n\nTo be clear -- it is obvious that NVIDIA has an incredible early mover advantage when it comes to AI hardware today. It's also clear that Nvidia is not resting on its laurels when it comes to designing and delivering next-generation AI-related hardware .\n\nThe challenge that's keeping me away from Nvidia's shares today has nothing to do with its business or its prospects, it's the company's valuation. Nvidia's shares are trading at a level that requires it to deliver spectacular growth for years to come, just to justify the price it already commands in the market.\n\nIn my mind, the best time to have bought Nvidia would have been that brief window between the cryptocurrency bust and the start of the AI boom. At that point, around September of 2022 , Nvidia's shares were trading based on its prospects as a key hardware designer, rather than as the core picks-and-shovels play of the AI revolution.\n\nCan Nvidia continue to thrive? Yes.\n\nWill its operations continue to grow as AI gets more embedded in our everyday lives and jobs? Probably.\n\nWill today's new investors be rewarded for the risks they're taking by putting their money in Nvidia's shares? Well, that's where I'm having trouble justifying a purchase.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia may be \"the one that got away\"\n\nFor a sense of why I'm nervous, analysts expect Nvidia to earn about $20 per share in 2025, after an estimated $11.50 per share in 2024. Overall, those same analysts are expecting the company's earnings to nearly double each year for the next five years.\n\nIf the company delivers earnings growth in line with those prospects over the next few years, then its recent market price above $725 per share may be justified. Yet to deliver that kind of consistent earnings growth over that long a period of time, Nvidia will need to continue to pump out more and more hardware, at higher and higher margins.\n\nOn top of that, the market generally tries to be forward-looking when valuing a company. So it's not enough for Nvidia to simply grow like wildfire over the next several years to justify its current market capitalization. It then needs to at least maintain those higher earnings over time to keep its stock price from falling.\n\nIf you take a step back away from the AI-related hope, Nvidia has a history of being cyclical. Even if Nvidia benefits from the build out of AI-related infrastructure, the company would face a natural slowdown when that growth turns into maintenance after that infrastructure is built.\n\nAnd of course, competition won't sit there and let Nvidia own the entire global AI computing infrastructure. Even if that competition isn't as good as Nvidia in the AI space, it just has to be good enough to provide an alternative for its customers. That would put a dent in Nvidia's margins to make it that much harder for Nvidia to see the massive, sustained profit growth that analysts are already expecting from it.\n\nPut all those factors together, and Nvidia may very well turn out to be the stock that got away from me. At this point, I'm willing to watch it from the sidelines and wish its shareholders the best.\n\nTread carefully if you choose to invest\n\nOf course, as someone who follows a value-focused investing strategy, I have a tendency to be a bit late to the investing party when it comes to brand new, world-changing trends. While it means I rarely participate in the booms from those innovative trends, it also means that I am frequently in a reasonable spot to ride out the busts that frequently follow.\n\nOn one hand, today's investors in Nvidia may be rewarded for buying its shares early enough in the growth stage of the AI revolution. On the other hand, they may find themselves bag holders owning near the peak of a cyclical high point. If the outcome were knowable for certain, there would never be massive moves in the market when companies post surprise changes in earnings or guidance.\n\nWith that uncertainty the only thing that's truly clear when it comes to Nvidia's share price, investors should tread carefully. If things do end up poorly for its shares (even if the business continues to thrive), you don't want so much at risk that you'll wind up financially devastated.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

This week\u2019s list includes Walmart WMT, Amazon AMZN, Target TGT, Microsoft MSFT and Nvidia NVDA.\n\nRetail Earnings Loom: What's In Store?\n\nWalmart shares were down in response to the last quarterly release on November 16th following modestly underwhelming guidance, but the analyst commentary about the report was generally favorable. The analysts\u2019 positive take on the quarterly results can also be gauged from their earnings estimates for the following periods, which have increased slightly since then.\n\nWalmart shares remained under pressure for roughly three weeks following the mid-November 2023 quarterly report, during which the stock lost more than -10% of its value. The stock has made an impressive rebound since then and is currently trading at its 52-week high, outperforming the market since the start of January 2024 (+8.9% vs. +5.3%).\n\nIt will be interesting to see if this performance momentum can be sustained following fresh quarterly results on Tuesday, February 20th. We wouldn\u2019t be surprised by a sell-the-news type of reaction as we saw following the November 2023 release.\n\nThe expectation is that the company will bring in $1.65 per share in earnings on $170.6 billion in revenues, representing year-over-year changes of -3.5% and +4%, respectively. Please note that the $1.65 per share estimate is up from $1.63 per share a few days back.\n\nTarget isn\u2019t expected to report quarterly results till March 5th, though Home Depot is also on deck to report results Tuesday morning along with Walmart. The chart below shows the one-year performance of Walmart, Home Depot, and Target relative to the S&P 500 index.\n\nWith respect to the Retail sector 2023 Q4 earnings season scorecard, we now have results from 17 of the 33 retailers in the S&P 500 index. Regular readers know that Zacks has a dedicated stand-alone economic sector for the retail space, which is unlike the placement of the space in the Consumer Staples and Consumer Discretionary sectors in the Standard & Poor\u2019s standard industry classification.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Zacks Retail sector includes not only Walmart, Target, and other traditional retailers, but also online vendors like Amazon and restaurant players. The 17 Zacks Retail companies in the S&P 500 index that have reported Q4 results already belong to the e-commerce and restaurant industries.\n\nTotal Q4 earnings for these 17 retailers that have reported are up +72.4% from the same period last year on +10.7% higher revenues, with 88.2% beating EPS estimates and 58.8% beating revenue estimates.\n\nThe online players and restaurant operators easily beat EPS estimates but have struggled to beat top-line estimates.\n\nConcerning the earnings and revenue growth rates, we like to show the group\u2019s performance with and without Amazon, whose results are among the 17 companies that have reported already. As we know, Amazon\u2019s Q4 earnings were up +410.9% on +13.9% higher revenues, beating top and bottom-line expectations.\n\nAs we all know, the digital and brick-and-mortar operators have been converging for some time now. Amazon is now a decent-sized brick-and-mortar operator after Whole Foods, and Walmart is a growing online vendor. This long-standing trend got a massive boost from the Covid lockdowns.\n\nWe have started seeing signs of stress at the lower end of income distribution. One can intuitively project moderation in consumer spending as the economy further slows down under the weight of tighter monetary conditions. Inflation may be down from the multi-decade highs of a few quarters back, but it still remains a headwind, particularly for the lower end of income distribution. Other issues, like the resumption of student loan payments, are seen as weighing on spending trends. That said, the labor market remains very strong, with wages still going up.\n\nWe will hear more about issues on the Q4 earnings calls, likely in the context of their outlooks for the coming periods.\n\nStandout Features of the Q4 Earnings Season\n\nThe overall picture that emerged from the Q4 earnings season is one of stability and resilience as a whole, with key pockets starting to enjoy notable acceleration in the growth momentum.Earnings aren\u2019t great, but no one expected corporate profitability to be strong. The earnings naysayers have been relatively less vocal in their doom-and-gloom pronouncements lately. But the fear of an impending earnings cliff has been in the back of market participants\u2019 minds. These results have likely eased many of those fears.\n\nWith quarterly results from more than 79% of S&P 500 members already out through Friday, February 16th, here are the five key features that these quarterly results have confirmed.\n\nFirst, the Q4 earnings and revenue growth pace represents an acceleration from what we have seen in recent quarters.\n\nThe absolute level of Q4 earnings and revenue growth isn\u2019t much, and the improving trend may not seem like a big deal to some of you. But we nevertheless see this improving growth trend as significant and a sign of the things to come in the coming periods.\n\nFor the 396 S&P 500 members that have reported results through Friday, February 16th, total earnings and revenues are up +5.1% and +3.4% from the same period last year, respectively. Concerning the beats percentages, 78.8% of the companies have beaten EPS estimates, and 64.4% have beaten revenue estimates.\n\nSecond, companies are making good progress on the margins front.\n\nThe year-over-year change in net margins turned positive in 2023 Q3 after staying in negative territory for six consecutive quarters. This margins recovery is a key driver of earnings growth in the coming periods.\n\nAt the sector level, Q4 net margins are above the year level for 9 of the 16 sectors, with the biggest gains at Tech, Consumer Discretionary, Retail, Industrial Products, Utilities, Finance, and others.\n\nOn the negative side, Q4 margins are below the year-earlier level for 7 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with the biggest declines in the Medical, Autos, Energy, and Transportation sectors.\n\nThird, the Tech sector is firmly back in the growth mode now, and the trend is expected to continue going forward.\n\nFor the 79.4% of Tech companies in the S&P 500 index that have reported Q4 results already, total earnings are up +20.5% on +6.1% higher revenues, with 83.3% beating EPS estimates and 71.7% beating revenue estimates.\n\nLooking at Q4 results for the sector as a whole, combining the results that have come out with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total Tech sector earnings are on track to be up +25.7% from the same period last year on +8.2% higher revenues.\n\nThe sector went through a period of post-Covid adjustment in 2022 and the first half of 2023 when it became a drag on the aggregate growth picture.\n\nPlease remember that Tech isn\u2019t just any other sector but rather the biggest earnings contributor to the S&P 500 index. The sector is currently expected to bring in 28.6% of the index\u2019s total earnings over the coming four-quarter period, with the second and third biggest contributors in Finance and Medical at 17.8% and 12.5%, respectively.\n\nThis means that the Tech sector\u2019s growth profile has a very big impact on the aggregate picture, both negatively and positively. The sector dragged down the aggregate growth picture in 2022 and the first half of 2023, now appearing ready to resume its historically positive growth role.\n\nPlease note that the Tech sector is instrumental in keeping the aggregate growth picture in positive territory in Q4. Of the reported results, the +5.1% earnings growth drops to a decline of -0.7% when Technology is excluded from the results.\n\nFourth, related to the Tech sector\u2019s strong showing is the dominance of the so-called Magnificent 7 companies \u2013 Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla.\n\nEach of the Mag 7 companies relies on technological innovation to dominate its respective space. But strictly speaking, not all of them are in the Tech sector, as we at Zacks have Amazon as part of the Zacks Retail sector and Tesla as part of the Zacks Auto sector.\n\nNvidia will report its Q4 results on February 21st, but the rest of the Mag 7 members have already reported results. For Q4 as a whole for the group, combining the actuals that have come out for the six group members with estimates for Nvidia, total Mag 7 earnings are expected to be up +48.8% on +14.5% higher revenues.\n\nThe Mag 7 companies are expected to bring in 20% of all S&P 500 earnings in 2024 and currently account for 29.5% of the index\u2019s total market capitalization.\n\nPlease note that S&P 500 earnings growth for Q4 would be in negative territory if not for the heavy lifting from Mag 7: -3% vs. +5.4%.\n\nFive, the revisions trend has notably stabilized after appearing to turn substantially negative at the start of 2023 Q4.\n\nEstimates for 2024 Q1 and full-year 2024 are modestly coming down, with negative revisions from some sectors mostly getting offset by positive revisions from others.\n\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>> Q4 Results Paint a Positive Earnings Picture\n\nWhy Haven\u2019t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

Here's what to look for.\n\nLast quarter Nvidia reported revenues of $18.12 billion, up 206% year on year, beating analyst revenue expectations by 12.5%. It was a stunning quarter for the company, with a significant improvement in its gross margin and an impressive beat of analysts' EPS estimates.\n\nIs Nvidia buy or sell heading into the earnings? Read our full analysis here, it's free.\n\nThis quarter analysts are expecting Nvidia's revenue to grow 239% year on year to $20.54 billion, improving on the 20.8% year-over-year decline in revenue the company had recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings are expected to come in at $4.63 per share. Nvidia Total Revenue\n\nThe analysts covering the company have been growing increasingly bullish about the business heading into the earnings, with revenue estimates seeing seven upward revisions over the last thirty days. The company has a history of exceeding Wall St's expectations, beating revenue estimates every single time over the past two years on average by 6.5%.\n\nLooking at Nvidia's peers in the processors and graphics chips segment, some of them have already reported Q4 earnings results, giving us a hint of what we can expect. SMART's revenues decreased 30% year on year, missing analyst estimates by 0.3% and Lattice Semiconductor reported revenue decline of 3% year on year, missing analyst estimates by 3.3%. SMART traded up 8.2% on the results, and Lattice Semiconductor was down 12.3%.\n\nRead our full analysis of SMART's results here and Lattice Semiconductor's results here.\n\nInvestors in the processors and graphics chips segment have had steady hands going into the earnings, with the stocks flat on average over the last month. Nvidia is up 21.9% during the same time, and is heading into the earnings with analyst price target of $741.6, compared to share price of $727.1.\n\nWhen a company has more cash than it knows what to do with, buying back its own shares can make a lot of sense\u2013as long as the price is right.

Of course, the Federal Reserve\u2019s apparent determination to cut rates later this year is also piquing the Street\u2019s interest in growth stocks. In any event, here are three growth names to buy to exploit the Street\u2019s new-found rationality.\n\nSchrodinger (SDGR) Image of white paper airplanes on horizontal trajectory with one red paper airplane rising upward, symbolizing growth stocks\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Pasuwan\n\nSchrodinger (NASDAQ:SDGR), which uses artificial intelligence to speed up the drug-discovery process, appears to have begun to rally thanks to Nvidia\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) decision to increase its investment in a similar firm.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSpecifically, \u201cNVDA raised its stake in Recursion Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:RXRX) to $76 million from $50 million,\u201d as I noted in a previous article. Like SDGR, RXRX uses AI to shorten the notoriously arduous process of developing pharmaceuticals.\n\nSince Nvidia\u2019s new purchases of RXRX stock were disclosed on Feb. 14, SDGR stock has rallied 17%.\n\nAlso noteworthy is that the forward price-sales ratio of SDGR is 8.4, while that of RXRX is about 48 times. SDGR has collaboration deals with at least six large drug makers, while Recursion only deals with two major drug makers.\n\nGiven these points, SDGR has much more room to advance than RXRX over the longer term.\n\nStory continues\n\nIntel (INTC) Close up of Intel (INTC) sign at entrance of The Intel Museum in Silicon Valley.

At the event, it will probably provide information about new customers to boost INTC stock.\n\nMeanwhile, as noted last month, the firm\u2019s Gaudi 2 AI chips are competitive with Nvidia\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) top AI chip, the H100, in multiple categories. INTC\u2019s backlog of orders for these chips reached $2 billion as of the end of last year, while it\u2019s planning to introduce a new product version later this year with a quadrupling of processing power and a doubling of networking bandwidth.\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) an American Express (AXP) credit card sticking out of someone's pocket\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) reported strong fourth-quarter results on Jan. 25 as its revenue climbed 11% versus the same period a year earlier while its bottom line soared 23% to $1.93 billion.\n\nAlso notable is that the credit card network predicts revenue will increase 9% to 11% this year, while its earnings per share will rise to $12.65 to $13.15 from $11.21 in 2023.\n\nThe firm is getting a big boost from the tremendous prosperity enjoyed by the wealthiest 10% of Americans over the last several years. AXP\u2019s cards tend to cater to well-off consumers. As the bull market continues, upper-income Americans, who own most of the nation\u2019s stocks, will likely increase their spending due to the well-known \u201cwealth effect\u201d on expenditures. That phenomenon should provide the company with another significant lift.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held long positions in SDGR and INTC, while his wife held long positions of SDGR, INTC and AXP.

As the earnings season peaks, we explore three stocks to buy this week, and we explain the reasons behind it.\n\nThe relatively heavy economic data published last week, including the U.S. CPI and Retail Sales figures, has added market volatility. It also seemed that the U.S. economy would avoid a recession, a positive catalyst for those looking for stocks to buy this week. Both events bolstered investor sentiment despite rising bond yields.\r\n\r\nLast week also caught the market somewhat broadening out beyond its largest constituents. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies gained strong momentum, implying overall optimism. This provided another sign for those risk-on investors looking for stocks to buy in the small-cap space.\r\n\r\nThe February 19 \u2013 23 earnings calendar may be fairly light, leaving direction in the hands of the remainder of corporate earnings reports. A primary focus for those scouting stocks to buy will be tech giant Nvidia\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) widely anticipated earnings release. Investors may secure some of their profits ahead or post-announcement, inducing downward pressure on its stock price. However, a solid quarterly report would probably help lift the broader market.\r\n\r\nIn addition to Nvidia, where earnings could prompt upward or downward momentum, a few other stocks to buy could present interesting opportunities. Solid earnings may help offset potential increased volatility should the last of the Magnificent 7 fail to catalyze further upside across markets.\u200b\n\nStarbucks (SBUX) Learnin' From Luckin, Starbucks Stock Heats Up a Strategy\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock.com\n\nStarbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), the prominent coffee company, could be one of the stocks to buy this week. The company presents an interesting investment opportunity during a week anticipated to focus substantially on tech news. Despite the company\u2019s earnings results at the beginning of February missing analyst estimates, investors initially helped push the stock price higher. Yet, during the subsequent period following the release, its stock price declined below the level it stood at during the announcement. However, SBUX\u2019s retracement has not coincided with any adjustment to its underlying fundamentals.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe company reported increased profits of 20% year-on-year (YOY) and maintained a generous dividend policy. This suggests its stock price may stabilise as investors refocus beyond the immediate post-earnings reaction.\r\n\r\nStarbucks currently trades on a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 22.9x, below the 27.2x of the S&P 500 Index. Analysts have established an average price target of $107.15, representing a 15% potential upside.\u200b\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nFor those interested in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) stocks to buy, Palo Alto (NASDAQ:PANW) could be one of the more intriguing opportunities this week as optimism in the tech sector remains buoyant. The company is scheduled to report its quarterly results after the close of trading on Tuesday. Its stock price has risen in anticipation of the earnings release, and if the optimism continues, it could still be one of the stocks to buy not just for this week but also the following.\r\n\r\nDespite the bottom line growing some 66% in the previous quarter, the market reacted negatively to disappointing forward revenue guidance. Therefore, guidance will likely be a key focus this time around. Analysts forecast EPS growth of 24% to $1.30, with revenues increasing 19% to $1.97 billion. Notably, Palo Alto has a track record of exceeding analyst estimates by an average of 20% or more.\n\nLennar (LEN) Lennar (LEN) website homepage. Lennar logo visible on the phone screen\n\nSource: madamF via Shutterstock\n\nHomebuilder Lennar (NYSE:LEN) could be the last of the stocks to buy this week after seeing its share price drop in the wake of the CPI data released last week. It suggested that the Federal Reserve (Fed) may maintain higher interest rates and, therefore, mortgage prices would increase. However, with easing yields, its stock price could stage a rebound.\n\nAn even bigger catalyst for the construction company may be Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) upcoming earnings report at the end of the week. This is because Warren Buffett, the Oracle of Omaha, has been accumulating homebuilder stock lately, including a $21.4 million stake in Lennar. While a small portion of his overall investment portfolio, the renowned investor\u2019s interest in the company implies it may have growth potential as the U.S. continues grappling with a sizable housing deficit of 3.1 million units.\r\n\r\nLennar currently trades at a P/E ratio of just 10.9x while holding a $6.3 billion cash reserve to invest in new opportunities. The company increased its cash holdings by $1.7 billion since last year, which makes it an even more compelling stock to buy this week.\n\nOn the date of publication, Stavros Tousios did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Concept. Selective focus. Stocks to buy like Nvidia\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is leading the charge in transforming AI with its latest developments. The organization is a big player in the AI field. It has been deemed so because of the company\u2019s GPU technology, which is a requirement for AI and machine learning operations. However, Nvidia is expanding its AI solutions to the software and cloud services areas as well. Hence, AI has become more affordable for companies operating in different industries. The company is in a constant process of innovation in AI, gaming and self-driving cars, which translates into tremendous growth.\n\nThe company recently showcased AI Workbench tools and novel graphics processing units (GPUs) based on Tensor Cores. These innovations focus on simplifying the creation of generative AI models on desktops and laptops. They prioritize efficiency and tackle the typical memory and performance constraints of PCs. Additionally, the forthcoming AI Workbench aims to provide effortless access to crucial AI resources. That will encourage collaboration and enhance flexibility in project management.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, Nvidia has marked a significant advancement in AI infrastructure with its DGX GH200 AI supercomputer. The product integrates the Nvidia NVLink Switch System with a Grace Hopper Superchip for the first time, promising unparalleled NVLink bandwidth to meet the complex needs of AI research. Interestingly, major IT companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google Cloud are exploring their potential for generative AI activities. Nvidia is also improving the performance of data centers with Grace\u2019s Superchip CPU and the H100 chip. These technologies will greatly reduce the time needed to train ML models, and the world of AI might totally turn upside down. That kind of strategic move places Nvidia among the top competitors in the data center and cloud computing industries.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft is deliberately establishing itself as a leader in the AI industry, indicating a substantial shift toward incorporating AI into its products and services.\n\nThe tech giant is heavy on its ecosystem through Copilot. Its important platforms, such as Windows 11, Bing and Edge, show its strong intentions to use AI to improve user experience. The latest upgrade (ver 11), integrating over 150 AI-assisted features, is another proof of Microsoft\u2019s efforts toward novelty and user-centered design.\n\nIn terms of AI stock forecasts, Microsoft\u2019s achievements seem optimistic. The company\u2019s attempts to inject AI capabilities into Bing and Edge, shifting from conventional search approaches to offering rich visual material, demonstrate a forward-thinking strategy. That transition intends to provide consumers with a more engaging and customized digital experience, establishing a new benchmark for how technology interacts with everyday life.\n\nFurthermore, the integration of AI into Microsoft 365 Copilot and the release of AI-enhanced Surface devices demonstrate a comprehensive strategy for integrating AI into productivity tools and hardware. These advancements not only improve users\u2019 creative and productive capacities but also demonstrate Microsoft\u2019s strong position in the AI industry. As Microsoft continues to develop, it cements its place as a vital participant in the future of AI technology.\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) Palantir logo on the smartphone and the company share price on the day of opening the trade October 1, 2020. Palantir valued at $15.8bn in stock market debut. PLTR stock\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) stands out among AI stocks, with a strong start in AI stock forecasts. In its most recent financial report, the company announced a significant increase with its first positive GAAP net income. That is a watershed event demonstrating Palantir\u2019s budgetary restraint and operational excellence. Furthermore, with a sales prediction of at least $2.18 billion for the year, the company sets a positive tone for market participants.\n\nFurthermore, Palantir Technologies\u2019 net income in the second quarter of 2023 was $28.13 million, with sales of $533.32 million. This period saw a significant improvement over the previous year\u2019s net loss, indicating the company\u2019s financial strength and operational effectiveness.\n\nFurthermore, Palantir\u2019s AI capabilities are gaining traction, particularly with the introduction of \u201cbootcamps.\u201d These programs provide customers with hands-on experience with its AI systems, indicating a promising future in demand. During this time, Palantir\u2019s shares increased by about 20%, indicating the company\u2019s market confidence is expanding.\n\nIn conclusion, Palantir Technologies is establishing a distinctive place for itself in the ever-changing technology industry. By emphasizing the use of big data analytics, Palantir is actively influencing the direction of technology. The firm is a stock to watch in the always-changing tech industry as it continues to break new ground and play a bigger role in the AI space, especially in providing data-driven insights and forecasts. As a result, it is not surprising to find this name among ChatGPT stock predictions.\n\nOn the publication date, Faizan Farooque did not hold (directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

I learned the hard way.\n\nIn January of this year, I hastily bought call options in Biomea Fusion (NASDAQ:BMEA) based largely on short-squeeze speculation. I didn\u2019t even bother to understand what the company does. The next day, BMEA stock tumbled badly. Fortunately, I was able to get out of the trade with a profit \u2013 but only with the skin of my teeth.\n\nI won\u2019t repeat the experience. FOMO got the best of me. And it will get the best of you if you\u2019re not careful.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nStill, I understand the pangs of regret of not biting on a hot stock. We\u2019ve all been there. However, there are few things worst in the market than converting FOMO into pain. Let\u2019s try to avoid that with a little prudence. Below are key stock prices to watch.\n\nIntuitive Machines (LUNR) Intuitive Machines (LUNR) black and white logo displayed on smartphone screen with desktop screen behind it showing company website and image of moon\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/T. Schneider\n\nOne of the high-flying speculative enterprises, Intuitive Machines (NASDAQ:LUNR) specializes in lunar program specialties. These include lunar surface access, orbit delivery, and communications at great distances. Days ago, the company was planning to launch its Nova-C commercial lunar lander with the help of launch partner SpaceX. Further, the mission had historical implications.\n\nAnother element that motivated LUNR stock to swing northward is the renewed interest in space exploration. Beyond just bragging rights, lunar missions should help accelerate scientific research. As well, the mission serves as a stepping to stone to exploring other parts of our galaxy.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s also fair to call LUNR stock overpriced. According to StockCharts, the security\u2019s relative strength indicator (RSI) stands at 85.75 points, indicating a wildly overbought status. Looking at LUNR\u2019s point-and-figure (P&F) chart, the stock prints a double top breakout pattern, suggesting further bullishness.\n\nStory continues\n\nNevertheless, downside risk to $4.75 to $5 also exists based on supply demand dynamics in the charts. Also, LUNR exceeded analysts\u2019 average price target of $5 (and the high side of $6). Therefore, it\u2019s one of the stock prices to watch \u2013 but not to buy just yet.\n\nRalph Lauren (RL) A Ralph Lauren outlet, October 21, 2013, Geneva, Switzerland.\n\nSource: Martin Good / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the most popular fashion companies, Ralph Lauren (NYSE:RL) represents a top-tier discretionary retail brand. However, is it top tier enough to warrant RL stock printing a nearly 24% return since the beginning of January? Let\u2019s add to the question: is Ralph Lauren worth a market premium of almost 53% up over the past 52 weeks? Because that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening.\n\nPersonally, it\u2019s difficult to see RL stock continuing to march higher given its overheated status. Looking at the charts, the equity\u2019s RSI indicator clocks in at 83.31 points. That\u2019s extremely overbought and when we saw a similar scenario play out in December, Ralph Lauren pulled back. Of course, it quickly shot higher but this move seems awfully incredible.\n\nLooking at RL\u2019s P&F chart, I recognize the ascending triple top breakout pattern posted on Feb. 15. However, supply demand dynamics suggest that if RL encounters headwinds, we\u2019re looking at a possible correction to $138 to around $146.\n\nNotably, while analysts peg shares as a moderate buy, the $190.25 average price target implies only 5% upside. I think it\u2019s one of the stock prices to watch.\n\nSoundHound AI (SOUN) In this photo illustration, the SoundHound logo seen displayed on a smartphone. SOUN stock\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nFolks are bullish on SoundHound AI (NASDAQ:SOUN) and for good reason. As InvestorPlace contributor Larry Ramer pointed out, SOUN stock jumped higher after Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) disclosed that it held about $3.7 million of SoundHound\u2019s shares. With Nvidia benefiting handsomely from artificial intelligence, it\u2019s not surprise that it likes SoundHound, which converts human speech directly into language that AI-powered computers can understand.\n\nQuite possibly, the innovation could represent the key to making AI far-less frustrating. Believe it or not \u2013 and I believe because I\u2019ve seen it \u2013 AI-driven chatbots are unreliable, even in the field of math which should be their forte. It\u2019s math, after all. Still, I\u2019m not entirely sure that SOUN won\u2019t incur a near-term correction.\n\nYes, the Nvidia news is awesome but we\u2019ve already seen how other AI-related enterprises have stumbled. Plus, SOUN prints an RSI of 84.94 points, indicating an extreme magnitude of overbought pressure. If the rally doesn\u2019t hold, it\u2019s quite possible to see shares correct to around $2.25.\n\nAnalysts don\u2019t agree, though, pegging SOUN a unanimous strong buy with a $4.67 target. At the very least, you\u2019ll need to be careful.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Concept. Selective focus. Stocks to buy like Nvidia\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a key player in AI thanks to its GPUs. For instance, the A100 and the ultra-modern H100 Tensor Core GPU have become foundational in training advanced artificial intelligence models.\n\nThe H100 uses high-level AI innovation in the form of Hopper architecture, which has the scalability and computing efficiency needed for huge AI workloads. This functionality has come with a huge demand for this tech from government organizations, cloud services, and more. That\u2019s good news for Nvidia stocks!\n\nThere\u2019s competition in any industry, and Nvidia has companies like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) angling for a market share. However, Nvidia\u2019s commitment to pushing out next-gen tech is keeping it in the lead.\n\nAugust 2023 saw the release of the Hopper GH200, with active deliveries set to start in Q2 2024. There\u2019s also the Black GB200 in the works, offering faster, more accurate training of sophisticated AI models.\n\nNvidia\u2019s position on the list of best AI stocks for February 2024 is not just because of its hardware offerings. The company also has CUDA, a computing software that\u2019s becoming the go-to for developers working on training enterprise-level AI models.\n\nAlthough Nvidia stock has surged by more than 40% since the beginning of the year, it remains one of the best AI stocks. Analysts expect EPS growth of 268% in FY2024 and 68% in FY2025.\n\nStory continues\n\nLast month, NVIDIA announced it would hold a conference call on February 21 to discuss its financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2024. In the last quarter, the semiconductor giant reported earnings of $3.92 per share, with revenue of $18.12 billion.\n\nWith exciting product cycles to come and increasing AI adoption in varied industries, NVIDIA and its stocks are well-positioned to capitalize on AI\u2019s growth.\n\nAccenture (ACN) A photo of the Accenture (ACN) logo in silver and white on a silver, reflective wall outside a building.\n\nSource: Tada Images/ShutterStock.com\n\nThe top AI stocks in February show great promise for companies doing the futuristic work of shifting enterprise AI usage from the experimentation stage to active implementation. One company helping its clients adopt AI technology is Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN). In 2023, it announced a $3 billion investment in its AI division to assist customers in leveraging AI for enhanced business productivity.\n\nThis company is witnessing a huge demand for its services and is poised to capitalize on this opportunity. Accenture is a market leader in AI, with up to 1,450 AI patents and many more pending applications. Accenture is also leveraging its market-leading expertise to help clients in varied industries use AI to scale their operations.\n\nThe biggest selling point for Accenture is its specialized services, which revolve around personalization in generative AI. Through these services, Accenture is pushing the frontier, giving enterprises in manufacturing, retail, and other fields the power to modify foundational models as needed. It also offer a proprietary switchboard technology that combines various generative AI models to fit unique enterprise operational needs.\n\nAI may be a dream for many. However, for Accenture, that dream is now. The last fiscal year saw $300 million in sales from generative AI. This year, it already managed $450 million in bookings.\n\nIf numbers are to be believed\u2014and in the investment world, they are\u2014Accenture stocks are set for a massive bull run.\n\nAlongside the impressive sales numbers, the company is set to double the number of AI specialists it employs to 80,000. With only 12% of global companies able to harness AI capabilities, Accenture is likely to play a major role in disrupting the global business landscape through generative AI.\n\nIBM (IBM) Quantum computing stocks: Sign of IBM with Canada Head Office Building in background in Markham, Ontario, Canada. IBM is an American multinational technology company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nIBM Corporation (NYSE:IBM)\u00a0 is one of the biggest players providing cloud and quantum computing solutions. Also, its further advances are within AI, creating some of the most powerful AI systems like Watson, which are used across different industries, functions, and practices\u2014be it data analysis, human language understanding, or decision-making.\n\nIBM surprised experts by predicting a better-than-expected growth of around 5% in its sales for 2024, not counting changes in currency value. It also expects to have about $12 billion in free cash flow this year, which is impressive.\n\nIBM said more customers using AI systems boosted the demand for its software and services. Some top experts also pointed out that IBM\u2019s estimate of having $12 billion in cash for 2024 stands out, especially since they had thought it would be between $11 billion and $11.5 billion.\n\nIt has a price-earnings ratio of 18.3, which analysts think investors can take advantage of now. Hence, the company\u2019s excellent future and good value make IBM one of the best AI stocks to keep in view in February 2024.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Lim did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

A $20,000 investment made in the semiconductor giant 10 years ago would be worth more than $3.4 million today -- up by around 170 times in value.\n\nIt is also worth noting that the company has taken less than a decade to turn a $20,000 investment into precisely a $1 million. Assuming you bought $20,000 worth of Nvidia stock on Aug. 1, 2016, your investment would now be worth just into seven figures. NVDA Chart\n\nSo, if you have $20,000 in investible cash after paying your bills, retiring any high-interest debt, and building up an emergency fund large enough to cover you in rough times, should you be putting that money into Nvidia in the hopes that it can replicate its past performance and make you a millionaire?\n\nHow Nvidia grew 50-fold in less than a decade\n\nNvidia's business has grown tremendously in the past eight years. In its fiscal 2016 (which ended Jan. 31, 2016), the company reported $5 billion in revenue. When the company releases its fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 results later this week, its annual revenue is expected to come in at almost $60 billion.\n\nThat stunning 12-fold increase in revenue in eight years means that Nvidia's revenue increased at a compound annual rate of 36%. This impressive growth can be attributed to the company's dominant position in the market for discrete graphics processing units (GPUs), which were originally used in gaming personal computers (PCs) to improve the graphics performance of games. Its graphics cards are now deployed in multiple areas ranging from automotive to data centers to digital twins.\n\nThe market has handsomely rewarded Nvidia for its growth, and it is now the world's fourth-largest company, boasting a market capitalization of $1.82 trillion. That's a massive step up from the company's $30 billion market cap back in August 2016. And the company still has some terrific growth drivers that could help it maintain a solid pace of growth in the future.\n\nStory continues\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is the first of those catalysts. The market for AI chips could be worth $305 billion in 2030 as compared to $29 billion in 2022. With a market share of 92% in that niche, Nvidia is in a prime position to capitalize. Meanwhile, the company has been gaining ground in the multibillion-dollar market for digital twins as well.\n\nThrow in other catalysts, such as the cloud gaming market, and it is easy to see why consensus estimates are for the company's earnings to increase at a compound annual rate of just over 100% for the next five years. Even better, Nvidia management pointed out in its investor day presentation a couple of years ago that it sees revenue opportunities worth a whopping $1 trillion across its various end markets.\n\nGiven that Nvidia's fiscal 2024 revenue is set to come in at just under $60 billion, it can be said that it hasn't scratched even 10% of its total addressable market. So, based on Nvidia's total addressable market estimate, the possibility of the company's revenue growing 12-fold again cannot be ruled out.\n\nHowever, how long that would take or whether it's really going to happen are in question, and something similar can be said about the stock's ability to turn a $20,000 investment into a $1 million stake.\n\nCan this semiconductor giant grow 50-fold once again?\n\nFrom its current market cap of around $1.8 trillion, a 50x jump would take its market cap to an astronomical $90 trillion. That seems absurd -- the entire global economy was worth an estimated $105 trillion last year.\n\nGiven that the global gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to grow at an annual rate of 2.2% a year through 2030, the global economy could be worth around $122 trillion by the end of the decade. Expecting Nvidia to account for almost three-fourths of the global economy is not reasonable. However, it is worth noting that global GDP has increased by just over 1,800% in the past 50 years.\n\nAssuming that the global economy clocks 1,000% growth in the next 50 years, global GDP could reach $1.155 quadrillion. In that context, a $90 trillion market cap looks less impossible for Nvidia. If continues to exist for another half-century and remains the dominant supplier in its end markets thanks to its solid product development moves, it might turn a $20,000 investment made today into $1 million, eventually.\n\nOf course, if Nvidia fails to keep up with its competitors over those decades, it may not be able to give investors the returns they may be expecting. However, Nvidia's outlook for the next few years seems bright enough to warrant an investment.\n\nNvidia is still a top stock to buy right now\n\nWe have already seen how fast Nvidia is growing. More importantly, analysts are anticipating eye-popping bottom-line growth from the company thanks to its solid position in the AI chip market and the other catalysts it is sitting on. As a result, it won't be surprising to see Nvidia's stock delivering healthy returns over the next five years.\n\nGiven that Nvidia is trading at 35 times forward earnings as compared to its five-year average earnings multiple of 42, now would be a good time to buy this top AI stock before it surges higher.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

And the excitement continues to ratchet up.\n\nThe biggest (in money terms) news came on Friday, when Bloomberg reported that Masayoshi Son\u2019s SoftBank planned to attack Nvidia head-on with a new AI chip venture, for which Son was hoping to raise $100 billion. Of that sum, $30 billion would apparently come from SoftBank and $70 billion from Middle Eastern institutions. The venture is reportedly codenamed Izanagi, in reference to the Japanese creator deity. SoftBank used to have a $3.6 billion stake in Nvidia, but dumped it all at the start of 2019, and now wants to create a rival.\n\nThe Izanagi news sent SoftBank\u2019s share price up by nearly 5% today. If the plan comes to fruition, it will be interesting to see any alliance between it and Arm, in which SoftBank has a 90% stake. As Arm\u2019s chip designs have become crucial to chipmakers such as Nvidia, Arm risks raising antitrust concerns if it partners with any chipmakers. Just ask Nvidia, whose planned $40 billion takeover of Arm collapsed two years ago in the face of regulatory scrutiny. (Nvidia did however recently take a $147 million stake in Arm, which currently enjoys a market cap of $132 billion.)\n\nSoftBank\u2019s big chip play is yet another indicator of its pivot from funding startups\u2014which mostly turned out pretty badly\u2014to focusing on semiconductors. The company is awash with cash, thanks to both a windfall stemming from the 2020 merger of T-Mobile US with SoftBank's Sprint, and the sudden rise in Arm\u2019s fortunes. (It may or may not be worth noting at this point that SoftBank is among the rumored potential buyers for the U.K. AI-chip firm Graphcore, which is hemorrhaging money and desperately seeking a way out.)\n\nAs for looking to the Middle East for the rest of Izanagi\u2019s funding\u2026well, that sounds familiar. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is doing the same thing for his proposed, supposedly multi-trillion-dollar AI-chip venture, and Bloomberg reported Friday that he\u2019s seeking the U.S. government\u2019s blessing, for a couple reasons. First, there\u2019s a likelihood of major Middle Eastern backing sparking a national-security review. Second, if this ends up being a separate venture from OpenAI but OpenAI ends up being a customer or competitor, Altman could place himself in a conflict of interest that might attract antitrust scrutiny.\n\nStory continues\n\nSpeaking of the U.S. government, the Biden administration is starting to hand out the first really enormous piles of subsidies under the 2022 CHIPS Act, to stimulate semiconductor manufacturing on American soil. (Microchip Technology has already been awarded $162 million, and BAE Systems $35 million.) Today, the government announced it had signed preliminary terms with GlobalFoundries, in which the giant chipmaking contractor will receive $1.5 billion to build out and modernize its U.S. production capabilities. And Bloomberg reports that Intel may receive $10 billion to support the onshoring of some of its manufacturing.\n\nEven if the up-to-$7 trillion Altman is reportedly seeking for his chip venture is fantasy money, the real sums in play these days are eye-watering enough.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) slipped 0.1% for the week. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell 1.3%.\n\nMarkets will be closed on Monday for the Presidents' Day holiday.\n\nWith few economic events on the calendar expected to severely sway investor sentiment, the earnings report from AI darling Nvidia on Wednesday after the market close will take center stage in the week ahead. Reports from Walmart (WMT), Home Depot (HD), Moderna (MRNA), and Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) will also be in focus throughout the week.\n\nA blip in the economic story\n\nThe growing economic consensus has hit a bump in the road.\n\nOver the past several months, a string of stronger-than-expected data had many investors embracing a possible soft landing, in which inflation would fall to the Federal Reserve's 2% target without a severe economic downturn.\n\nRecent data over the past week has challenged that narrative. Both the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) showed prices increased more than economists projected in the last month. And the January retail sales report showed sales dropped by more than economists had expected. In other words, neither inflation nor consumer spendingimproved.\n\n\"While January data are often noisy, the inflation data do suggest that disinflation took two steps back in January,\" Bank of America US economists Stephen Juneau and Michael Gapen wrote in a note to clients on Friday.\n\nJuneau and Gapen wrote that the January inflation data vindicates the Fed's \"wait-and-see approach\" to cutting interest rates and that they agree with the new market consensus that the first interest rate cut will come in June rather than March or May.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more: What the Fed rate decision means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards\n\nThis marks a stark shift in investor sentiment on Fed cuts. Investors are now pricing in a roughly 35% chance the first cut comes in May, per the CME FedWatch Tool. A month ago, investors had placed a 97% chance that the first cut would come by the end of the May meeting.\n\nNvidia takes center stage\n\nPerhaps the most important earnings report of the fourth quarter reporting season is slated to hit the tape on Wednesday after the closing bell. The chipmaker's lead in AI has propelled it to the third-highest market cap in the world, only trailing Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT).\n\nSince a blowout earnings report last May when Nvidia topped Wall Street's estimates for revenue guidance by more than 50%, the company has consistently topped analysts' expectations. And many on Wall Street expect another blowout quarter. Consensus projects Nvidia to report earnings per share of $4.60 and revenue of $20.36 billion. That would mark year-over-year growth of 422% and 236%, respectively.\n\nFor a stock that has already rallied almost 50% this year, the risk for investors lies in if the company's string of hefty beats finally ends. And given Nvidia's outsized weighting in the major indexes and its value in the AI story, it could be a risk to the broader market too.\n\nInteractive Brokers chief strategist Steve Sosnick told Yahoo Finance's Madison Mills that the report could be \"very difficult\" for markets.\n\n\"If Nvidia misses or just fails to hit a home run ... that can have a gravitational effect on the whole market,\" Sosnick said.\n\nThe market narrative hasn't changed, yet\n\nNvidia's earnings are a reminder that while the recent string of economic data provided some challenges to the soft-landing narrative, the overall market story has changed little in recent weeks. Stocks have stomached unsatisfying news, with the S&P 500 hitting fresh highs despite a shift in investor expectations from the rate cut cycle starting in March to the cycle beginning in June.\n\nAI stocks are still shooting higher as enthusiasm remains plentiful for the new technology (see the 150% one-month gain in Super Micro Computer (SMCI) for the latest example). And a look under the surface shows that the fundamental story for stocks has held up too.\n\nThe latest data from FactSet, released on Friday, shows that with nearly 80% of S&P 500 companies done reporting earnings, the index is pacing for earnings growth of 3.2% in the fourth quarter. That number has been moving up steadily in recent weeks as more companies report.\n\nAs we've been noting, earnings beats have come across sectors too, which many believe could lead to a broadening of market returns beyond just a few top tech stocks later this year. Recent research from Truist co-CIO Keith Lerner pointed out that, sincethe market's recent bottom in late October, a broadening has been underway.\n\n\"The market rally that we have seen since October is broader than many investors give it credit for,\" Lerner wrote in a note to clients on Thursday night.\n\nThis played out in the most recent week of trading with the equal-weighted S&P 500 (RSP) and the small-cap Russell 2000 Index (^RUT) \u2014 two indexes commonly referenced by market strategists who think the stock market rally will extend beyond the few stocks currently leading the charge. Both rose more than 0.7%. The S&P 500 fell about 0.4%.\n\nThese signs of a market shift come as Renaissance Macro head of economics Neil Dutta pointed out several times this week that the soft-landing market narrative still remains in play. And that is largely because the macro conversation hasn't changed, Dutta added.\n\n\"We\u2019re still talking about an economy that is growing reasonably well and a central bank that is thinking about when it will cut rates,\" Dutta wrote. \"A recalibration of policy is still likely this year.\" SANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA - FEBRUARY 05: A sign is posted at Nvidia headquarters on February 05, 2024 in Santa Clara, California.

However, the good sign is that the industry has been trying to stage a solid rebound since the second half of the year. Sales have been steadily on the rise and are poised to grow further in 2024.\n\nThe Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) said earlier this month that global semiconductor sales totaled $526.8 billion in 2023, reflecting a decline of 8.2% from $574.1 billion in 2022.\n\nHowever, microchip sales totaled $146 billion in the fourth quarter of last year, jumping 11.6% year over year and 8.4% sequentially. Also, sales increased month over month in December, totaling $48.6 billion, a rise of 1.5% from November, according to the SIA.\n\nThe semiconductor industry witnessed unprecedented growth during the peak of the pandemic. However, challenges such as rising costs, supply-chain disruptions, and higher interest rates due to the Federal Reserve's monetary tightening policy began impacting sales in 2022 as demand waned.\n\nThe initial slow sales of semiconductors in the first half of 2022 were attributed to inventory adjustments made by clients in the PC, consumer electronics and server sectors. The situation improved in the second half of 2023 as inflation showed signs of decline, alleviating price pressures.\n\nIn 2023, semiconductor products across segments recorded impressive sales. Logic products emerged as the leading category, with sales totaling $178.5 billion.\n\nFollowing closely, memory products totaled $92.3 billion in sales. Microcontroller units (MCUs) saw robust growth of 11.4%, totaling $27.9 billion in sales. Also, sales of automotive integrated circuits (ICs) witnessed impressive year-over-year growth of 23.7%, setting a new record at $42.2 billion.\n\nNow, SIA anticipates double-digit growth in semiconductor sales, driven by increasing demand. Also, the industry is going to benefit once the Federal Reserve starts cutting interest rates, as it will further ease price pressures.\n\nStory continues\n\nOur Choices\n\nGiven the promising future, it would be wise to invest in semiconductor stocks like Applied Materials, Inc.

A favorable product mix and stringent cost control also benefit the bottom line.\n\nWhat Our Model Indicates\n\nPer the Zacks model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.

This creates a real problem for those of us who are quite familiar with these blasts from the past, having been born a decade or two before.\n\nTake legendary investor David Einhorn, founder of Greenlight Capital Inc., who has decided to wave the white flag and change strategies altogether by focusing on those companies that will pay him back via share buybacks and dividends since investors appear to no longer want to properly reward non-AI companies for success.\n\nYou might think money would eventually start to move into other segments, but the opposite is happening. Not so long ago, it used to only be about the Magnificent Seven, but that\u2019s since been whittled down to the Magnificent Three complemented by a few smaller AI companies.\n\nFor example, since 2022, Nvidia Corp. is up more than 150 per cent, Meta Platforms Inc. is up 40 per cent and Microsoft Corp. nearly 25 per cent, according to Charlie Bilello, chief market strategist at Creative Planning LLC. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 is up only eight per cent, Apple Inc. is up five per cent, Amazon.com Inc. is up three per cent and Alphabet Inc. is up by only one per cent, while Tesla Inc. has run out of battery power and is down by over 45 per cent.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t help that giants such as Berkshire Hathaway Inc., despite already sitting on a pile of cash, have been trimming their position in Apple. Meanwhile, billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller dumped shares of Alphabet, Amazon and Broadcom Inc., but is still sitting on his largest position \u2014 Nvidia.\n\nAs a result, Nvidia has now surpassed both Alphabet and Amazon in market cap and is also larger than the entire U.S. energy sector combined, which produces more than 13 million barrels per day. Then you have smaller companies such as Super Micro Computer Inc., which is up over 200 per cent this year. If you had invested $10,000 in that company about four years ago, it would be worth roughly $325,000 today.\n\nStory continues\n\nMore impressive is that these few dominant companies seem completely unaffected by broader market developments while the majority of the others are not as fortunate and are selling off on negative macro developments and barely moving on positive micro ones.\n\nFor example, on Feb. 13, worries about interest rates after higher-than-expected U.S. inflation data came in had zero impact on Nvidia and Super Micro Computer and yet the iShares Select Dividend ETF, representing the largest U.S. dividend companies, including International Business Machines Corp. and Verizon Communications Inc., sold off nearly three per cent.\n\nYou also had West Texas Intermediate oil prices that rose one per cent and yet both Canadian and U.S. exploration and production companies were down two per cent on the day.\n\nThose few of us goals-based investment managers have the luxury of watching all this from the sidelines, given we don\u2019t have to chase any tech-heavy benchmarks or try to get the entry and exit timing right, which we think is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to do.\n\nThe longer this goes on, the greater the fall, and some fall it will be if companies such as Nvidia follow the same path that Cisco Systems Inc. did post-2000. However, this all means putting up with days like Feb. 13 in the interim.\n\nIn today\u2019s environment, our conservative pension-like portfolio is by no means as sexy as Nvidia, but it\u2019s doing the job for us and our clients. Our allocation remains: 45 per cent long equity with an overweight in dividend-focused companies in Canada and the U.S. paying on average five per cent in dividends; 40 per cent in structured notes as a fixed-income replication, paying six per cent to 12 per cent annual coupons with 30 per cent downside barriers; 10 per cent in short-term bonds and the money market paying five per cent to 6.5 per cent; and five per cent in private equity for longer-term, low-double-digit growth.

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.\n\nSo if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing.\n\nSee our latest analysis for NVIDIA\n\nNVIDIA's Improving Profits\n\nInvestors and investment funds chase profits, and that means share prices tend rise with positive earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. So for many budding investors, improving EPS is considered a good sign. It is awe-striking that NVIDIA's EPS went from US$2.39 to US$7.65 in just one year. Even though that growth rate may not be repeated, that looks like a breakout improvement. But the key is discerning whether something profound has changed, or if this is a just a one-off boost.\n\nOne way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. The good news is that NVIDIA is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 20.4 percentage points to 46%, over the last year. That's great to see, on both counts.\n\nIn the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers. earnings-and-revenue-history\n\nIn investing, as in life, the future matters more than the past. So why not check out this freeinteractive visualization of NVIDIA's forecast profits?\n\nStory continues\n\nAre NVIDIA Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\n\nSince NVIDIA has a market capitalisation of US$1.8t, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$71b. Investors will appreciate management having this amount of skin in the game as it shows their commitment to the company's future.\n\nShould You Add NVIDIA To Your Watchlist?\n\nNVIDIA's earnings per share growth have been climbing higher at an appreciable rate. That EPS growth certainly is attention grabbing, and the large insider ownership only serves to further stoke our interest. At times fast EPS growth is a sign the business has reached an inflection point, so there's a potential opportunity to be had here. Based on the sum of its parts, we definitely think its worth watching NVIDIA very closely. What about risks? Every company has them, and we've spotted  1 warning sign for NVIDIA  you should know about.\n\nAlthough NVIDIA certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares.

But Nvidia Is Investing in 5 Other AI Stocks.", "content": "Over any meaningful time span, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a blockbuster investment. It's up almost 1,800% over the last five years, and it has more than tripled in the past year alone, fueled by investors' excitement for artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThere's good reason to believe Nvidia is a top AI stock. Management attributes its surging revenue to AI-related products and services. To illustrate how strong demand is, the company expects to report revenue of $20 billion in its fiscal 2024 fourth quarter. That would be a 231% year-over-year increase -- simply astounding for a company of this size.\n\nAI is the top investment trend right now, and Nvidia stock is one of the most popular ways to ride the trend higher. However, for its part, the company is buying shares of five other AI companies.\n\nThis interesting development made the news on Feb. 14 with Nvidia's first 13F filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This form is for institutional investment managers to report their stock holdings.\n\nAccording to its 13F, Nvidia has a stock portfolio worth $230 million, and these are the AI stocks it's been buying.\n\nA glimpse inside Nvidia's stock portfolio\n\nNvidia's 13F shows it owns only five stocks, but all five have a connection to AI in some capacity. Here's a quick overview of each company, from the largest investment down to the smallest.\n\nArm Holdings(NASDAQ: ARM) licenses its AI semiconductor chip designs to other companies, and this business is in high demand right now. Nvidia tried to acquire Arm back in 2020 but finally called it off in 2022 after pushback from regulators. Now, it will look to benefit as an investor. This is Nvidia's largest stock position, valued at $147 million as of the SEC filing. Next in Nvidia's portfolio is Recursion Pharmaceuticals(NASDAQ: RXRX). This early-stage biotechnology company is using AI models to process genetic data and find new drugs. It's an idea that could be game-changing for the medical field, which is why the stock has also caught the attention of growth investor Cathie Wood. SoundHound AI(NASDAQ: SOUN) offers an AI voice assistant that's similar to what's already offered by major tech companies. However, SoundHound AI believes its AI is more capable of understanding normal language. And based on its growing customer list, there seems to be support for management's claim. Of Nvidia's stocks, investors might want to disregard TuSimple Holdings, considering it's delisting from the Nasdaq. That said, this company has an AI angle as well -- it's working to enable autonomous driving for trucking companies. Finally, Nano-X Imaging(NASDAQ: NNOX) -- or just Nanox -- is Nvidia's smallest stock position. This company hopes to transition the world to a new digital X-ray technology. It intends to use AI to go through these digital images and find patterns that doctors might overlook, leading to better outcomes for patients.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhen it comes to AI stocks, I personally believe the trend, as a whole, is overhyped. And stock market history is littered with past trends that eventually fizzled out. Therefore, investors need to be discerning.\n\nThat said, I believe AI can unlock a lot of possibilities when it comes to the medical field. This is why I'm particularly intrigued with Nvidia's investments in Recursion Pharmaceuticals and Nanox.\n\nThese two stocks are particularly high-risk and high-reward\n\nFull disclaimer before I go any further: I am not a medical expert in the slightest. I'm just a regular investor on the outside looking in. Investing great Warren Buffett says to stay inside of your circle of competence. And fellow great Peter Lynch says to invest in what you know. Medical stocks aren't that for me.\n\nHowever, I do know enough to understand datasets are enormous in this field, and processing large amounts of data is where AI really shines.\n\nConsider one of Recursion Pharmaceutical's newest partnerships as an example. In the third quarter of 2023, it partnered with Tempus to gain access to 20 additional petabytes (over 20,000,000 gigabytes) of oncology data. It now has a staggering 50 petabytes at its disposal for cancer research. And to process this much information, the company will keep working with Nvidia to make its BioHive-1 supercomputer more powerful.\n\nNanox only has a limited number of medical devices in operation right now. But when it went public in 2020, the company hoped to eventually deploy 15,000 machines, which would make more than 150 monthly digital scans each.\n\nNanox is still a long way from that goal, and it may never get there. But hitting its goals would represent nearly 2.3 million medical images per month. This could quickly become the largest medical-imaging dataset in the world, and the company will need to use AI to make any sort of discovery.\n\nRecursion Pharmaceuticals and Nanox are looking to use AI to unlock important medical breakthroughs by using enormous medical datasets. This is why I say these two stocks have enticing upside.\n\nThat said, both Recursion Pharmaceuticals and Nanox have meager revenue streams and enormous losses, as the chart below shows. RXRX Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nRecursion Pharmaceuticals and Nanox are very high-risk stocks, and investing in them should not be taken lightly. Both have an elevated chance of failing, and Nvidia's investment in them shouldn't be viewed as something that guarantees success.\n\nIt's exciting to think about what could happen if things go right, and AI leads these two companies to major breakthroughs. Investors just need to keep their emotions in check, fully recognizing the risks that come with these stocks.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

The halving is a cyclical event in which the scarcity of Bitcoin is increased as the volume of cryptocurrency awarded to miners is halved. Many investors are expecting market-wide rallies that are similar in scale to the 2021 bull run.\n\n\u201cIf ETF-related inflows materialize as we expect, we think an end-2025 level closer to USD 200,000 is possible,\u201d explained Geoff Kendrick, head of digital assets at Standard Chartered.\n\nSo where does the semiconductor industry factor in a crypto bull run? The demand for semiconductors increases during crypto bull runs due to the increased need for a high computing power. The semiconductor market is already enjoying an impressive rally off the back of 2023\u2019s generative artificial intelligence (AI) boom. By powering the cryptocurrency mining revival this year, we will see sustained growth and the emergence of fresh market players throughout the year.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFor some budget semiconductor stocks that may have room to grow, it\u2019s worth considering the following three options.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) Close up photo of microchip (aka semiconductor chip, semiconductor device, Integrated Circuit) hold in tweezers with TSMC (TSM) logo on a background.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), or TSMC, is the world\u2019s largest semiconductor operator, boasting a 56% market share.\n\nDespite its advantageous market position, TSMC was overshadowed by Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) in 2023. Consequently, there\u2019s ample opportunity for the stock to benefit from heightened investor demand during the crypto bull run.\n\nTSMC has been actively countering potential risks stemming from geopolitical tension between China and Taiwan by building new locations across the globe.\n\nThe company\u2019s revenue forecasts for 2024 anticipated 25% growth, so there\u2019s plenty for investors to be excited about. With more crypto miners set to seek out semiconductor solutions to support their operations, we\u2019ll see TSMC\u2019s status as a market leader place the firm in good stead.\n\nStory continues\n\nIntel (INTC) Close up of Intel (INTC) sign at entrance of The Intel Museum in Silicon Valley.

After sales and profitability forecasts fell far below Wall Street expectations, the stock tumbled 12% at the end of January \u2014 its largest decline in over three years.\n\nDespite this, the stock quickly recovered its losses. Bank of America analysts suggesting that Intel Foundry Services (IFS) could position itself as a leading alternative to TSMC drove Intel\u2019s rebound.\n\nWhile TSMC\u2019s position as a market leader is strong, geopolitical tensions between China and Taiwan may push more customers towards IFS.\n\nThe custom chip market topped $30 billion in 2023. The generative AI boom, coupled with renewed interest in cryptocurrency mining, could form the perfect storm for Intel\u2019s growing expansion into the 2024 world of semiconductors.\n\nAxcelis (ACLS) Image of the Axcelis (ACLS) logo on a web browser amplified through the lens of a magnifying glass\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nUnlike the other semiconductor stocks we\u2019ve looked at in this article, Axcelis (NASDAQ:ACLS) doesn\u2019t produce chips itself. Rather, this stock manufactures ion implantation equipment that plays a major role in the creation of chips.\u00a0Axcelis produces semiconductor hardware like storage (NAND) chips, memory (DRAM) chips and advanced logic (CPU) chips.\n\nIn 2023, Axcelis reportedly experienced exceptional demand in the silicon-carbide power device market. The company had a major $1.2 billion order backlog, amounting to the equivalent of a year\u2019s worth of revenue.\n\nWith a market cap of less than $5 billion, Axcelis is a relatively small company that\u2019s ripe for growth. As the demand for ion implantation grows amidst the crypto boom, we could see Axcelis achieve exceptional numbers.\n\nOn the date of publication, Dmytro Spilka did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The down Jones was off 0.1% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 1.3% due to rising rates. The benchmark U.S. treasury yield started the week at 4.17% and closed out the week at 4.30%. The inflation prints (which means the Fed is likely to cut rates in the near term) led to rise in bond yields.\n\nMeanwhile, January retail sales data came in at soft. In January, U.S. retail sales experienced a setback, slipping more than anticipated. The Commerce Department's Census Bureau reported a 0.8% drop in retail sales for the month, down from a 0.4% gain in December and worse than the estimate for a 0.3% drop (per a CNBC article). The drop in sales was caused declines in both auto dealership and gasoline service station receipts (read: 4 ETF Areas to Play Despite Soft January Retail Sales).\n\nOn a positive note, although the S&P 500 was down for the week, the index hit an all-time high last week. Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, surged past the $52,000 mark for the first time since December 2021. The surge primarily came on the back of the increasing movement of institutional money into the asset class (read: Bitcoin Tops 52,000: 5 ETFs Leading the Rally).\n\nThe National Association of Home Builders (NAHB)/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index (HMI) experienced a notable increase, climbing 4 points to reach 48 in February. This improvement marks the third successive month of positive sentiment in the housing market and represents the highest level of confidence since August 2023.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, below we highlight a few ETF areas that should be under close watch to start this week.\n\nNvidia to Beat on Earnings?\n\nZacks Rank #2 (Buy) NVIDIA NVDA is set to report its earnings on Feb 21, 2024, after the market closed. NVIDIA Corporation is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU. Nvidia currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an Earnings ESP of +3.67%.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to our methodology, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. The Zacks Consensus Earnings and Sales estimates for the to-be-reported quarter for Nvidia are $4.45 and $20.21 billion, respectively.\n\nNvidia-heavy ETFs like VanEck Semiconductor ETF SMH, AXS Esoterica NextG Economy ETF WUGI and Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF BOTZ should be under watch for likely gains.\n\nRates to Rise Again?\n\nSimplify Interest Rate Hedge ETF (PFIX) has jumped 5.9% last week as rates rose driven by a spike in inflation. In January, U.S. inflation topped expectations as persistently high shelter prices weighed heavily on consumers. The consumer price index rose by 0.3% for the month (read: 4 Sector ETFs & Stocks to Benefit from Hot Inflation).\n\nOn a year-over-year basis, the increase stood at 3.1%, a slight decrease from December's 3.4%. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had anticipated a monthly increase of 0.2% and an annual gain of 2.9%. However, the actual figures surpassed these expectations, as quoted on CNBC.\n\nHeadline month-over-month producer price index (PPI) reached +0.3%, 20 bps higher than the +0.1% expected \u2014 in fact, the highest we\u2019ve seen since +0.4% reported in September of last year. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, the core print comes in much hotter, i.e., +0.5% from an anticipated gain of 0.1%, which is the highest print since the early part of 2022, back when the Fed first started raising interest rates to cool inflation.\n\nThis means rates are likely to remain high in the near term and ETFs that give investors protection against high rates should continue to excel.\n\nBitcoin Miners to Fall On Profit Booking?\n\nBitcoin prices gained about a modest 4% last week but bitcoin miners skyrocketed on blockbuster Coinbase earnings. GraniteShares 2x Long COIN Daily ETF CONL surged 55% last week while Global X Blockchain ETF BKCH advanced 17.6%.\n\nCoinbase Global (COIN) cheered investors after reporting solid fourth-quarter 2023 earnings results on Feb 15, after the closing bell. It posted its first quarterly profit in two years, beating on earnings and revenues. Trading volume also surged on a new wave of optimism about digital assets, marking a turning point for the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange (read: Coinbase Surges on Blockbuster Q4 Earnings: ETFs to Buy).\n\nInvestors may intend book profits on ETFs like Fidelity Crypto Industry and Digital Payments ETF FDIG (up 13.8% last week, up 29.2% past month) and First Trust SkyBridge Crypto Industry & Digital Economy ETF CRPT (up 13.7% last week, up 39.6% past month). So, one should tread cautiously on bitcoin miners and blockchain ETFs.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

Over the last year, this collection of companies has become known as the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\n\nThe rise of these top investments is thanks to the relentless advance of information technology, computing power, and the internet -- collectively built atop the practical application of semiconductors. But there's been a big shake-up in the ordering of the Magnificent Seven stocks in recent weeks. Here's what investors need to know.\n\n\"Tiny\" Nvidia sails past Alphabet and Amazon\n\nIn mid-February 2024, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) -- by far the smallest of the Magnificent Seven companies as measured by revenue and total employees -- surpassed Google-parent Alphabet and Amazon in total market capitalization value. Times are changing, and investors are loading up on what is increasingly viewed as the emergent leader in the new artificial intelligence (read: accelerated computing) economy.\n\nCompany Year Founded Market Cap Trailing-12-Month Revenue ~Total Employees Microsoft 1975 $3.02 trillion $228 billion 221,000 Apple 1976 $2.84 trillion $386 billion 161,000 Nvidia  1993 $1.80 trillion $44.9 billion 26,000 Alphabet  1998 $1.78 trillion $307 billion 183,000 Amazon 1994 $1.76 trillion $575 billion 1.5 million Meta Platforms 2004 $1.23 trillion $135 billion 67,000 Tesla  2003 $639 billion $96.8 billion 140,000\n\nData source: YCharts and company financial filings, as of Feb. 16, 2024.\n\nIf you believe in compounding growth, it makes sense Microsoft and Apple are the largest companies by market capitalization. They've been around the longest and have thus had the most time to build their empires.\n\nNvidia hitting the No. 3 spot in market cap is notable, and not just because of its comparatively diminutive size. After Microsoft and Apple, Nvidia is the oldest business of the companies on this list of magnificent long-term investments.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut there are some other elements to Nvidia's business worth pointing out. The other six businesses have catapulted to stardom with very consumer-oriented business models: Microsoft and Apple are pioneers of the PC era, and Apple ushered in the mobile device explosion. Google still makes most its money from internet search, while Amazon e-commerce is ubiquitous in North America (although its cloud computing infrastructure unit AWS still pays most of the bills). And Tesla has successfully gotten the ball rolling on the electric vehicle and software-defined car market.\n\nNvidia's explosion onto the scene is thanks to AI infrastructure, a decidedly far more nebulous business to the average person. Of course, Nvidia is a consumer-facing company too, and if you're into PC video games, you've probably been very aware of Nvidia's existence since at least the early 2000s.\n\nBut video games are the minority revenue generator these days. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang decided to go all in on developing semiconductors and accelerated computing infrastructure a number of years ago, propelling the data center segment to dizzying heights in the last year. Image source: Nvidia.\n\nThree stats, and what they mean for investors\n\nNo matter how you slice it, though, Nvidia's rise to the third-largest Magnificent Seven stock as measured by market cap is astonishing. Paired with the two other stats in the aforementioned chart -- revenue and total employee count -- investors are clearly betting that Nvidia's actual business is going to get a lot bigger over the next few years.\n\nLet's emphasize the word betting. Nvidia's foundational work around next-gen computing infrastructure has been going on for years, but it was only somewhat recently recognized by the investor community at large. Many are scrambling for a cut and minimizing the fact that Nvidia has highly cyclical revenue, as do most research and development-driven semiconductor businesses. NVDA Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nThe point is, Nvidia stock's latest surge shouldn't be expected to continue going up and to the right forever. It's a safe assumption to make that at some unknown point in the future, there will be a cooldown in AI infrastructure spending. When that happens, expect Nvidia stock to notch a significant sell-off, just like it has in the past. NVDA Chart\n\nAs a longtime happy shareholder of Nvidia, it's exciting to see the company's rapid progress. But be wary of all the hype as the company's status as a leader among the Magnificent Seven heats up. In fact, as wonderful as all these businesses are as top investments, they all go through cycles of growth and periods of more lackluster performance (like Tesla, which hasn't been so \"magnificent\" lately). A healthy dose of caution will serve long-term investors well at this juncture.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $20.21 billion, indicating a whopping 234% increase from the year-ago reported figure.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly earnings is pegged at $4.54 per share. This suggests year-over-year growth of 415.9% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s earnings of 88 cents per share.\n\nThe company\u2019s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the preceding four quarters while missing on one occasion, the average surprise being 19%.\n\nLet\u2019s see how things have shaped up before the announcement.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation Price and EPS Surprise\n\nNVIDIA Corporation price-eps-surprise | NVIDIA Corporation Quote\n\nFactors to Note\n\nThe continued strength of its Datacenter business on the increasing adoption of cloud-based solutions amid the growing hybrid working trend is expected to have boosted NVDA\u2019s fourth-quarter revenues. An increase in Hyperscale demand and growing adoption in the inference market are likely to have been tailwinds in the to-be-reported quarter.\n\nAdditionally, the Datacenter end-market business is likely to have benefited from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using GPUs based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures. The strong demand for its chips from large cloud service and consumer internet companies is anticipated to have aided the segment\u2019s top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter. Our third-quarter revenue estimate for the Datacenter end market is pegged at $16.4 billion, indicating robust year-over-year growth of 354.2%.\n\nMoreover, NVIDIA\u2019s fourth-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from the recovery across its Gaming and Professional Visualization end markets. The Gaming end market\u2019s last three quarters\u2019 results had shown signs of recovery as inventory with channel partners reached normal levels. The company also registered strong demand across most regions for its gaming products.\n\nStory continues\n\nRevenues from the Gaming end market increased 81% year over year while growing 15% sequentially to $2.86 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Our fourth-quarter revenue estimate for the Gaming end market stands at $2.83 billion, implying a 54.7% increase from the year-ago quarter.\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s Professional Visualization segment performance also reflected recovery, with revenues increasing 108% year over year and 10% sequentially in the third quarter. We believe that the trend is likely to have continued in the fourth quarter for the end market. Our fourth-quarter revenue estimate for the Professional Visualization end market is pegged at $433.3 million, suggesting a 91.7% increase from the year-ago quarter.\n\nFurther, the company\u2019s Automotive segment showed an improvement in trends in eight of the last ten quarters. The positive trend is likely to have continued in the fiscal fourth quarter, mainly due to increasing investments in self-driving and AI cockpit solutions. Our fourth-quarter revenue estimate for the Automotive end market is pegged at $294.5 million, indicating year-over-year growth of 0.2%.\n\nEarnings Whispers\n\nOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for NVIDIA this earnings season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat, which is the case here.\n\nEarnings ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate ($4.71 per share) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate ($4.54 per share), is +3.67%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nZacks Rank: NVIDIA carries a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nOther Stocks With the Favorable Combination\n\nPer our model, Synchronoss Technologies SNCR, AutoZone AZO and Booking Holdings BKNG also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases.\n\nSynchronoss sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has an Earnings ESP of +157.1%. The company is expected to report fourth-quarter 2023 results on Mar 5. Its bottom-line result surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice in the trailing four quarters while missing on two occasions, the average surprise being -16.8%. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Synchronoss\u2019 fourth-quarter bottom line is pegged at a loss of 11 cents per share, significantly narrower than the year-ago quarter\u2019s loss of 72 cents. The consensus mark for revenues stands at $43.8 million, calling for a year-over-year decline of 29%.\n\nAutoZone is slated to report second-quarter fiscal 2024 results on Feb 27. The company has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +3.83% at present. AutoZone\u2019s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 8.9%.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings is pegged at $26.18 per share, suggesting an increase of 6.3% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s earnings of $24.64. AutoZone\u2019s quarterly revenues are estimated to improve 4.4% to $3.85 billion.\n\nBooking Holdings carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has an Earnings ESP of +2.07%. The company is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2023 results on Feb 22. Its earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the preceding four quarters, with the average surprise being 16.4%.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Booking Holdings\u2019 fourth-quarter earnings stands at $26.69 per share, indicating a year-over-year improvement of 20%. It is estimated to report revenues of $4.65 billion, which implies an increase of approximately 14.9% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

A retail stock probably isn\u2019t your first choice when you think about A-rated stocks to buy. But Abercrombie &Fitch (NYSE:ANF) defies expectations that have been plaguing the retail sector.\n\nThe company, which is best known for its brands Abercrombie, Hollister and Gilly Hicks, has over 750 stores in the U.S., Europe, Asia and the Middle East. It has avoided the supply chain issues, inflation woes and lowered profit margins that sent other retailers into a downturn.\n\nThe company saw strong sales across the board in the third quarter, with Americas sales up 22% to $867 million; sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa up 14% to $157.9 million; and sales in the Asia-Pacific region up 13% to $30.8 million.\n\nOverall, ANF saw third-quarter sales of $1.1 billion, up 20% from a year ago. Abercrombie is reporting full-year and fourth quarter numbers next month, when it\u2019s expected to post sales growth of 12% to 14% and an operating margin of roughly 10%.\n\nStory continues\n\nANF stock is up 276% in the last year and gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nSprouts Farmers Market (SFM) An exterior sign on a Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM) store in Granada Hills, California.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nSprouts Farmers Market (NASDAQ:SFM) is another retail stock, but this one is in the grocery arena. Grocery stocks are usually pretty solid choices, even in inflationary times, because you know sales will continue.\n\nSprouts, however, operates in a niche by focusing on natural and organic products rather than processed and packaged foods. It has over 400 stores in 23 U.S. states, with plans to open at least 10 new stores a year.\n\nEarnings in the third quarter came to $1.7 billion in revenue, with comparable store sales up 3.9% from a year ago. Sprouts also repurchased 831,000 shares at a price of $32 million, which helped drive the stock price higher.\n\nSprouts will report full-year earnings on Feb. 22, and I\u2019m expecting another solid quarter.

In a crowded field, Dell has roughly 8.5% of the market share, placing it in third place among the competition.\n\nBut this old dog is learning a new trick. The company\u2019s stock has been higher in the last year as investors are buying into Dell\u2019s artificial intelligence plans. It operates a generative AI platform that helps its customers generate better predictions and analyze data.\n\nThanks to consumer interest in generative AI, Dell saw 9% growth in its server and networking revenue in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Company officials say they expect that trend to continue into the next fiscal year.\n\nOverall earnings for the quarter included revenue of $22.2 billion, down 10% from a year ago. But net income was $1 billion and $1.36 per share, much better than a year ago when the company brought in $241 million and 33 cents per share.\n\nDELL stock is up 96% in the last year and also shows a dividend yield of 1.8%.

Even though Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) leapt to the forefront of generative AI and holds a lion\u2019s share of the market, AMD is in a good place right now.\n\nAMD\u2019s MI300 AI processors, which are set to compete directly with Nvidia, look to bring in big profits for AMD this year. The company increased its full-year processor revenue projections for 2024 from $2 billion to $3.5 billion. And interestingly, analysts like CFRA Research\u2019s Angel Zino say that AMD is still likely being conservative with that estimate.\n\nRevenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $6.1 billion, up 10% from a year ago. Net income of $667 million was a vast improvement from $21 million in the same quarter last year.\n\nFor the full year, AMD reported revenue of $22.6 billion, down 4% from 2022.

However, U.S. labour market numbers have continued to show jobs churning out at a strong clip and elevated wage growth.\n\nIn Asia, Japan's Nikkei ended flat on Monday, pressured by chip-related shares following a slump in their U.S. counterparts late last week.\n\nChinese blue chips finished up just over 1%, enjoying tourism revenues during the Lunar New Year holiday which surged by 47% on a year earlier as more than 61 million rail trips were taken.\n\nThe country's central bank skipped a chance to cut rates again on Sunday, which will likely limit downward pressure on the yuan, but with deflation looming analysts see plenty of scope for further policy stimulus.\n\nThe same cannot be said for the United States as high readings on producer and consumer prices saw markets sharply scale back pricing for rate cuts.\n\nStory continues\n\nBruce Kasman, global head of economics at JPMorgan, warned the Federal Reserve's favoured measure of core personal consumption inflation could now jump by 0.5% in January. Only a week ago, markets were hoping for a rise of just 0.2%.\n\n\"While it is premature to place significant weight on noisy January data, risks have shifted in the direction that core inflation and labour market conditions both surprise the Fed in a hawkish direction in the first half of 2024,\" Kasman wrote in a note.\n\nFutures dropped, implying a 28% chance rates will be cut in May.\n\nHANGING ON NVIDIA\n\nThe surprise on inflation means the minutes of the Fed's last policy meeting out this week will now look dated, but any talk about the timing of potential cuts will be noted.\n\nThere are plenty of Fed speakers out this week to comment on the outlook, with Fed Vice Chair Philip Jefferson and Governor Christopher Waller of particular interest.\n\nThe market sea change on rates saw two-year Treasury yields spike to a new 2024 high of 4.72% on Friday before steadying at 4.65%. Treasury futures were little changed on Monday with the cash market closed.\n\nS&P 500 futures were flat, while Nasdaq futures added 0.22% helped by hopes Nvidia could somehow beat already stratospheric expectations.\n\nThe chipmaker's stock has surged 46% so far this year and accounted for more than a quarter of the S&P 500's gains. There is reason for optimism given that of the 80% of S&P 500 reporting so far, 75% have beaten forecasts.\n\nHigher bond yields were underpinning the dollar at 149.95 yen, though the threat of Bank of Japan intervention to prop up the yen has so far capped the currency pair at 150.88.\n\nThe dollar index was a touch firmer, while the euro was steady on the day at around $1.0774 .\n\nThe rise in yields took no shine off of non-yielding gold, which rose 0.3% to around $2,018 an ounce.\n\nOil prices were softer as concerns about demand tussled with the threat of supply disruptions in the Middle East.\n\nBrent slipped 76 cents to $82.71 a barrel, while U.S. crude for April fell 51 cents to $78.91 per barrel.\n\n(Reporting by Nell Mackenzie and Wayne Cole; Editing by Dhara Ranasinghe, Sam Holmes, Shri Navaratnam and Susan Fenton)", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-markets-world-shares-singed-111109485.html", "symbols": ["NVD.BE", "NVD.DU", "NVD.F", "NVD.HA", "NVD.HM", "NVD.MU", "NVD.STU", "NVD.XETRA", "NVDA.MX", "NVDA.NEO", "NVDA.US", "NVDC34.SA", "NVDG.F"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.942, "neg": 0.07, "neu": 0.832, "pos": 0.099}}, {"date": "2024-02-19T11:05:00+00:00", "title": "Insider Insights: Does Intel CEO\u2019s Recent INTC Buy Signal Strength Ahead?", "content": "What will it take to bring Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) back into the market\u2019s favor? It would certainly build confidence if the company\u2019s chief executive is also a shareholder. Even beyond that, the INTC stock outlook indicates improvement, albeit not perfection, so a small-sized allocation isn\u2019t a terrible idea.\n\nWe\u2019ve caught wind of discussion about whether Intel\u00a0is the \u201cnext\u201dNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). There\u2019s no need to obsess over comparisons like this, though. Intel can make strides in 2024 even if it\u2019s not in the same league as a juggernaut like Nvidia. All in all, Intel stock probably shouldn\u2019t be everyone\u2019s first-choice chip stock, but it still earns a respectable \u201cB\u201d grade.\n\nHow Much INTC Stock Did the CEO Buy?\n\nSome investors were disappointed with Intel after the company released its current-quarter guidance. Wall Street called for revenue of $14.2 billion, but Intel\u2019s guidance range of $12.2 billion to $13.2 billion fell short of the consensus estimate.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nYet, CEO Pat Gelsinger remains confident in Intel\u2019s growth prospects. In fact, Gelsinger reportedly bought 2,800 INTC stock shares through a trust for $119,700 on Feb. 1.\n\nPerhaps, Gelsinger envisions Intel making strides in the highly competitive AI-chip market. Currently, some analysts remain unconvinced. For example, Oppenheimer analyst Rick Schafer feels that Intel\u2019s AI offering is still in \u201cprove-it\u201d mode, while Needham analyst Hans Mosesmann warned, \u201cAI everywhere seems like everywhere except Intel.\u201d\n\nBut at least we can say that Gelsinger is putting his money where his mouth is. There are no guarantees, but it\u2019s at least possible that Intel\u00a0will show progress against its rivals in advancing the company\u2019s AI-enabled chips.\n\nAI-PC Resurgence Could Help Intel\n\nIn early 2024, we can already see Intel facing challenges. Frustratingly, Intel is delaying the construction of its Ohio-based chip-manufacturing facilities. Whereas Intel\u2019s previous timetable specified late 2025, now it appears that the construction won\u2019t be completed until late 2026.\n\nStory continues\n\nNot all the news is negative, however. Research firm Gartner envisions a potential catalyst for Intel\\ as rapid AI personal computer industry growth.\n\nAmazingly, Gartner estimates that smartphone manufacturers will ship out 240 million generative-AI smartphonesin 2024. The research firm expects vendors to ship out 54.5 million AI-enabled PCs this year.\n\nThis phenomenon could alter the PC landscape and revitalize the industry. Gartner Senior Director Analyst Ranjit Atwal explained, \u201cThe rapid adoption of on-device GenAI capabilities and AI processors will eventually become a standard requirement for technology vendors.\u201d\n\nThis presents Intel with an opportunity to capitalize on a burgeoning niche market. Prospective investors should keep tabs on Intel for signs of progress in advancing and commercializing AI-PC chips. The company doesn\u2019t need to be the \u201cnext Nvidia,\u201d but Intel can at least capture market share wherever it\u2019s possible.\n\nINTC Stock Outlook: Look for Improvement, Not Perfection\n\nOur INTC stock outlook doesn\u2019t call for the same magnitude of gains that you should expect from a juggernaut like Nvidia. Investors should have realistic expectations and just look for signs of improvement with Intel.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, Intel\u2019s chief executive is also a shareholder. Plus, if there\u2019s a revival in the PC market because of the AI-PC trend, Intel may capture some market share. Therefore, while it doesn\u2019t deserve the same confidence level as Nvidia stock, we\u2019re willing to give Intel stock a \u201cB\u201d grade.\n\nOn the date of publication, neither Louis\u00a0Navellier nor the InvestorPlace Research Staff member primarily responsible for this article held (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nChatGPT IPO Could Shock the World, Make This Move Before the Announcement Musk\u2019s \u201cProject Omega\u201d May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

Operational income is expected to grow 12% YoY for a rise of $6.761 billion, and the EPS is forecast to be $1.65, an 8% YoY rise.\n\nWalmart\u2019s stock has been trading at record highs this month, at over $170 per share. The company announced in January that it will divide its shares three to one in order to lower the price and make them more affordable for staff members.\n\nWalmart reported a number of solid quarters in 2023, helped by increased sales of basic goods like food and fuel. Although recent credit card statistics looked encouraging for the store, Walmart\u2019s recent gains will likely be slowed by reduced food costs and a downturn in general merchandise sales.

The company revised its full-year sales projections down by 3% to 4% due to weaker customer demand.\n\nStory continues\n\nZacks Investment Research reports that the consensus EPS expectation for the quarter is $2.76, based on predictions from 15 analysts. The EPS for the same quarter in the previous year was $3.3.\n\nHome Depot\u2019s shares are up more than 5% since the beginning of the year.

The company anticipates sales for the second quarter of its fiscal year in the range of $1.955\u20131.985 billion, indicating an 18\u201320% rise in revenue from the previous year.\n\nStrong momentum from transaction wins is likely what will have helped Palo Alto\u2019s second-quarter results and boosted its top line. The robust demand for form factor hardware products\u2014especially models driven by machine learning that provide enterprises zero-trust network security\u2014is anticipated to have had a role in the quarter\u2019s success.\n\nPalo Alto Networks\u2019 shares are up more than 26.80% since the beginning of the year.

The $570 billion gain in market capitalization more than triples Intel\u2019s market worth. Shares of Nvidia, whose processors are regarded as the gold standard in the AI business, increased by over 240% in 2023. The company last week also surpassed Alphabet, the parent firm of Google, to take the third spot as the most valuable US company.\n\nThe consensus expectation from 33 analysts is that Nvidia will report profits of $4.56 per share and an increase in quarterly sales to $20.378 billion from $6.05 billion a year earlier.\n\nNvidia\u2019s shares are up more than 50.70% since the beginning of the year.

The CEO at the time attributed its accelerated innovation across the global platform to a strategy involving greater use of AI and data.\n\nIntuit is expected to announce profits of $2.29 per share, representing a 4.09% increase over the prior year, and sales of $3.39 billion, representing an 11.36% increase over the same period last year.\n\nIntuit Corp\u2019s shares are up more than 8.60% since the beginning of the year.

At which point, the company confirmed their full-year 2023 projection of organic sales growth of 7% to 8% and an underlying trading operating profit margin of 17.0% to 17.5%.

Should You?", "content": "Aswath Damodaran deserves his nickname of the \"Dean of Valuation.\" He teaches corporate finance and valuation at the Stern School of Business at New York University. Damodaran has written multiple papers and books on valuation, including The Little Book of Valuation targeted for a general audience. He also regularly provides data on corporate valuations on his website.\n\nAny list of the world's most prominent stock valuation experts will include Damodaran. When he thinks a stock is overvalued or undervalued, it's usually a good idea to pay attention. That's why it caught my eye when the \"Dean of Valuation\" recently revealed that he's selling Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) stock hand over fist. Image source: Nvidia.\n\nDamodaran's assessment of the \"Seven Samurai\"\n\nDamodaran likes to refer to Nvidia, Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, and Tesla as the \"Seven Samurai.\" They're more popularly known as the \"Magnificent Seven.\" Damadoran, though, thinks these stocks are akin to the characters in Akira Kurosawa's classic movie The Seven Samurai who save a village from bandits. In his view, the seven stocks \"saved investors from having back-to-back disastrous years in the stock market.\"\n\nIn a blog post earlier this month, Damodaran noted that investors who haven't owned at least some of these stocks over the last decade would have had a difficult task in beating the market. In 2012, the combined market caps of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks totaled $1.1 trillion. By the end of 2023, their combined market cap had soared to $12 trillion -- greater than all of the publicly traded stocks in China.\n\nNvidia has delivered the biggest gains of the \"Magnificent Seven\" by far. Over the last 10 years, the chipmaker's shares have skyrocketed by more than 165x. The stock has more than tripled in value over the last 12 months.\n\nDamodaran wrote that all of the \"Magnificent Seven\" companies \"qualify as very good to awesome, as businesses.\" However, he believes that only Meta and Tesla are close to being fairly valued while the rest are overvalued.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat Damodaran thinks about Nvidia\n\nWith Nvidia's sizzling-hot returns, it's not surprising that Damodaran views the stock as the most overvalued of the \"Magnificent Seven.\" He recently posted on X (the social media platform formerly known as Twitter) that Nvidia \"is a bridge too far for me.\" Damodaran stated that he planned to sell half of his position in the stock.\n\nThe NYU professor isn't pessimistic about Nvidia's growth prospects, though. His valuation model assumed that the company will be able to increase its revenue by a compound annual growth rate of more than 32% over the next five years. Damodaran also projected that Nvidia will achieve an exceptional operating margin of 40%. He noted that he \"built in substantial value\" from artificial intelligence (AI) in his valuation of Nvidia.\n\nBut even with great expectations for Nvidia, Damodaran still thinks the stock is way overvalued. His model calculated a fair value for the stock of around $436. That's 40% below Nvidia's current share price.\n\nShould you sell Nvidia stock, too?\n\nI don't think that all investors should rush to the sidelines with Nvidia just because a prominent valuation expert is aggressively selling his shares. Damodaran acknowledged that his valuation analysis of Nvidia could be off if AI provides a significantly greater tailwind than he expects. I think that's a possibility.\n\nHe performed a similar valuation analysis of Nvidia last summer. Damodaran sold half of his position in the stock then, too. He left a lot of money on the table as a result.\n\nHowever, investors should take heed that Nvidia probably is priced for perfection. Any interruption in the company's remarkable growth would likely cause a major sell-off. In my view, though, a sharp decline in Nvidia's share price could also present a great buying opportunity.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

It soared 239% as investors added shares to their portfolios in anticipation of a boom in artificial intelligence (AI) spending. That buying spree has continued in earnest this year, with Nvidia's stock advancing another 50%.\n\nThere are still plenty of reasons to own Nvidia. The company not only dominates the market for machine learning processors, but also participates in other parts of the AI economy, including networking equipment, subscription software, and cloud services. However, Wall Street currently sees more upside in Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and Docebo(NASDAQ: DCBO), as detailed by the consensus price targets below:\n\nNvidia: $709.73 per share (implied downside of 3%) Amazon: $207.92 per share (implied upside of 23%) Docebo: $59.50 per share (implied upside 30%)\n\nThe most prudent way to benefit from AI is to buy a basket of stocks. Here's why investors should consider including Amazon and Docebo in their AI baskets.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon is a multifaceted business with compelling growth prospects in e-commerce, digital advertising, and cloud computing. It operates the most popular online marketplace in the world as measured by monthly visitors, and it continues to gain revenue share in North America and Western Europe. Moreover, while Alibaba currently leads the market in gross sales, Morgan Stanley expects Amazon to displace the company by 2027.\n\nBuilding on that, Amazon's strength in retail has evolved into a booming advertising business. Its unparalleled ability to engage shoppers and source data helps media buyers reach consumers with relevant campaigns. As a result, Amazon has steadily gained share in digital ad spending for several years, becoming the third-largest ad tech company, even as the leaders Alphabet and Meta Platforms have lost ground. Analysts at Insider Intelligence expect similar results in the future.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinally, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the leader in cloud infrastructure and platform services. Its 31% market share in the fourth quarter easily topped Microsoft's 24% market share and Alphabet's 11% market share, according to Synergy Research Group. That alone positions AWS as a probable beneficiary of AI, simply because cloud infrastructure is often the easiest way to run AI applications.\n\nHowever, consultancy Gartner  has also recognized AWS as a leader in artificial intelligence developer services, and the company recently bolstered its position in that market with Bedrock, a new service that helps developers build generative AI applications.\n\nHere's the bottom line: Retail e-commerce sales are projected to increase at 8% annually through 2030, while the ad tech and cloud computing markets are forecasted to grow at 14% annually. That gives Amazon a good shot at double-digit sales growth through the end of the decade, but its bottom line should increase more quickly as its high-margin businesses (i.e., advertising and cloud computing) account for more of total sales.\n\nIndeed, Wall Street expects earnings per share to grow at 30% annually over the next five years. In that context, Amazon's current valuation of 59 times earnings actually looks very reasonable. Patient investors should consider buying a small position in this stock today.\n\n2. Docebo\n\nDocebo provides a multi-product learning management system (LMS) that helps businesses create, deliver, and measure outcomes from training courses across internal (employee) and external (customer) audiences. One particularly innovative application is Docebo Shape. It uses generative AI to automate content creation, turning source material like corporate documents, presentations, and case studies into training material.\n\nFosway Group, a leading analyst of human resources technologies in Europe, has recognized Docebo as a leader in the LMS market for six straight years. Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley selected Docebo as a top generative AI stock in 2024. In a note to clients, analysts at the firm said Docebo is (1) taking share from legacy vendors in internal LMS use cases and (2) leading the LMS market in external use cases.\n\nMeanwhile, Docebo is still advancing its generative AI capabilities. The company has announced new features coming to Shape this year, including virtual role-play with real-time feedback and an integrated copilot that further simplifies the creation of learning content. Management says, \"Shape will fundamentally change how training material is created and consumed.\"\n\nAccording to Grand View Research, LMS spending will increase by 20% annually through 2030, but Docebo's strong market presence should translate into above-average growth. Indeed, Wall Street expects the company to grow sales at 25% annually over the next five years. That consensus forecast makes its current valuation of 9 times sales look cheap, especially when the three-year average is 13.9 times sales.\n\nDocebo may not be a familiar name for many investors, but the company has a strong presence in the LMS market, and it's using generative AI to help customers more easily create learning material. That makes Docebo a worthwhile addition to a broader basket of AI stocks.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

Yet that is still down 1% this year and 43% from the highs hit in 2021.\n\nIn contrast, Japan's Nikkei is up almost 15% for the year so far and paused just short of the all-time peaks hit back in 1989.\n\nEven after its surge the Nikkei is still only capitalised at 683 trillion yen ($4.55 trillion), about the same as Nvidia and Apple combined, and far below the S&P 500's $42 trillion.\n\nThe Nikkei's market cap is also not much more than the total cash held by Japanese companies, many of which trade at a discount to book value.\n\nSpeaking of Nvidia, the AI diva's results this week will be a test of its sky high valuations and a price to earnings ratio of no less than 96.\n\nThe chipmaker's $570 billion increase in market cap this year accounts for more than a quarter of the S&P 500's gains, so any disappointment would be a black eye for the whole index.\n\nOptions imply a risk the shares could swing 11%, or $200 billion, in either direction on the results.\n\nThen again Nvidia does have a very fat net profit margin of 42% and, as of October, a cash pile of $18 billion, so it can easily weather the vagaries of one result.\n\nIt is also riding the most powerful force in markets - momentum.

Because it's going up.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor Europe, there is no major data today but flash PMIs will be important later in the week, along with business and consumer sentiment surveys. Analysts are counting on the European Central Bank survey of consumer inflation expectations to resume its downtrend after a slight uptick in November.\n\nThe ECB's wage data are also of note given how much policymakers have warned about high wage growth, even though it is a well known lagging indicator.\n\nThere are plenty of ECB speakers out and about, including President Christine Lagarde at a Eurogroup press conference on Friday.\n\nFederal Reserve speakers this week include the always influential Fed Vice Chair Philip Jefferson and Governor Christopher Waller.\n\nThe Fed also releases on Wednesday minutes of its last meeting, though they have rather been overtaken by events given the high readings for consumer and producer prices.\n\nThere are ugly forecasts around that core PCE inflation could rise 0.5% in January, when markets had looked for only 0.2%.\n\nFed futures now only imply a 36% chance of a rate cut in May, when it was more than fully priced a couple of weeks ago.

The euro has also reached its highest so far this year on the yen at 161.95.\n\nThe single currency was steady on the dollar at $1.0784 , having met resistance just above $1.0800.\n\nThe rise in yields has been a burden for non-yielding gold, which was idling at $2,014 an ounce.\n\nOil prices were softer in early trade as concerns about demand tussled with the threat of supply disruptions in the Middle East.\n\nBrent slipped 32 cents to $83.15 a barrel, while U.S. crude for April fell 33 cents to $78.13 per barrel.\n\n(Reporting by Wayne Cole; Editing by Sam Holmes)", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-markets-asia-shares-cautious-002105580.html", "symbols": ["NVD.BE", "NVD.DU", "NVD.F", "NVD.HA", "NVD.HM", "NVD.MU", "NVD.STU", "NVD.XETRA", "NVDA.MX", "NVDA.NEO", "NVDA.US", "NVDC34.SA", "NVDG.F"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.963, "neg": 0.073, "neu": 0.826, "pos": 0.101}}, {"date": "2024-02-19T00:00:00+00:00", "title": "\nJose Najarro\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0Feb 19, 2024\n", "content": "Nvidia has announced numerous new products and partnerships in the past few months.", "link": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/02/19/everything-nvidia-stock-investors-need-to-know-bef/", "symbols": ["NVDA.US"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0, "neg": 0, "neu": 1, "pos": 0}}, {"date": "2024-02-19T00:00:00+00:00", "title": "\nKeith Speights\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0Feb 19, 2024\n", "content": "Will the AI tailwind be great enough to justify Nvidia's premium valuation?", "link": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/02/19/the-dean-of-valuation-is-selling-nvidia-stock-hand/", "symbols": ["NVDA.US"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.625, "neg": 0, "neu": 0.728, "pos": 0.272}}, {"date": "2024-02-19T00:00:00+00:00", "title": "What Are the Best AI Stocks in February 2024?
