For more stocks, head on over to Billionaire Ken Griffin's 2023 Portfolio: Top 5 Stock Picks.\n\nThe stock market crash of 2022 hammered several major hedge funds. One of the biggest funds that bled capital last year is Chase Coleman and Feroze Dewan's Tiger Global. According to Insider Monkey's research, the hedge fund's portfolio as of the first quarter of 2023 was worth a respectable $10.9 billion. Sounds respectable right? After all, it's more money than most of us will likely ever see in our lifetimes (never say never?). Well, you won't think it's a lot of money when you consider the same hedge fund's portfolio by the end of 2022's first quarter. Back then, the portfolio was worth a whopping $26.6 billion, implying that in just a year, Tiger Global's portfolio has been cut by more than half.\n\nAnother star that crashed last year was Catherine Wood's Ark Investment. Ark is known for obsessing over high growth technology companies, and these are precisely the ones that didn't see any love from the stock market last year. And the turbulence in these areas has also hammered Ark's portfolio. This portfolio, which was worth $23.9 billion by the end of Q1 2022 is currently worth $14.5 billion. Cumulatively speaking, data from LCH Investments - called the fund of funds - shows that the industry lost $208 billion last year and nearly one tenth of this was simply due to Tiger Global.\n\nHowever, not all funds were losers in 2022. The best performing hedge fund during the year was Ken Griffin's Citadel Investments. Citadel made $16 billion last year, nearly twice what the second best performing hedge fund D.E. Shaw Group made. So, undoubtedly, Citadel is the king of the hedge fund world right now. This strong performance made Citadel's founder and owner Mr. Ken Griffin not only one of the richest hedge fund managers in the world but also one of the richest people on the planet. Data from Forbes Magazine shows that Mr. Griffin's current net worth sits at a cool $32.3 billion - making him one of the fifty richest folks all around. Quite an achievement, we'd say, and one that becomes even more impressive when you consider the history of his fortunes. This is due to the fact that as recently as 2020, the billionaire's net worth stood at $12 billion. Looking at this, it would appear as if while the world is up in flames, Mr. Griffin knows how to hold his ground and do what he's best at doing i.e. making cold, hard cash.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe billionaire is an alumnus of Harvard University, and he has been investing since his time at college. He set up Citadel just a year after graduating from university, and would soon go on to make high double digit returns. So naturally, his perspective on how to deal with losses and navigate through adversity is nothing less of a goldmine. Well, lucky for us, Mr. Griffin offered some gems during a fireside chat at the Yale School of Management in April 2023, where he shared:\n\nWell there's a little saying, a little quip that I like to make. History is written by the winners. Right. So the wonderful history of Citadel is how we're the most profitable hedge fund of all time. The chapter of how we were on the verge of going business in '08 is now like a footnote in that book. All right. That's a very important note. It is now all been an easy march to success. It's had, you know, I think have the interesting position in life I probably lost, my team has probably lost more money that perhaps any other firm in existence. We just happened to have made more money [LAUGHS] than almost any other firm in existence. And it's the net that everyone talks about. I mean there's years when our lost are. . are. . .hundreds of billions of dollars, I don't know if it's hundreds, it's over a hundred, maybe hundreds. It's numbers are incomprehensible, right. So, number is all my losses are my tuition, I have the most expensive education in American history. And a number of my colleagues have education that are becoming competitively - expensive.\n\nAnd I think it's very important, that like, we, in some sense you have have to have a moment of levity, okay? If every time you lost money, you got depressed and angry and you couldn't deal with it, you'd just have a very short career. you'd just have a very short career. So you need to be able to take a step back and go, 'it's a tuition bill I paid.' And it doesn't mean that you don't think very long and hard about what went wrong. But you have to keep it in perspective.\n\nIn '08 that tuition bill almost became getting expelled from school. Because we were, we lost half of our equity in sixteen weeks, in a firm that had never had a double digit draw down in twenty years. The only reason we survived, and there's a number of reason, but the principle reason we survived is when long term capital failed 1998, I went and met with a number of senior people that worked at Long Term Capital. Why did I do this? What was my agenda? I wanted to understand how does a firm that loses 90% of its equity in a levered financial services industry, still stay in business? Like if you ask me that's one of the greatest accomplishments of all time, was that they lost 90% of their equity before they lost control of their business in a financial services, in a levered financial services company. And much of what we learned from how they survived that was actually fundamentally existentially important to our ability to withstand the turmoil of 2008. So there's a very important lesson here, which is not only due to want to learn from your mistakes, you would want to learn from other people's mistakes. They're much cheaper tuition bills.\n\nLearning from others is central to Mr. Griffin's philosophy. But what if you could learn from him? That's what we will do in this article. Let's take a look at some of Ken Griffin's favorite stocks, out of which some notable ones are Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META).

The two biggest tech companies are close to surpassing their peaks back in 2021, while others like Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) have more than doubled their value from their troughs. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has nearly tripled its value since October. These tech giants are only some of the best tech stocks to buy now.\n\nOf course, not all tech stocks were blessed with a rally. Companies that failed to cost-cut their way to profitability continue to trade at depressed levels, even with promising growth prospects. I believe taking advantage of the myopia and snapping up some of these shares will lead to excellent ROI in a multi-year timeframe.\n\nHere are three of the best tech stocks to buy now:\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSnap Inc (SNAP) The Snapchat and Instagram apps on displayed on an iPhone, which sits on a gray background.\n\nSource: BigTunaOnline / Shutterstock\n\nSnap Inc (NYSE:SNAP) currently offers a buy point that\u2019s too compelling to ignore. It peaked near $83 back in 2021, and it is very unlikely that the company will fail to surpass this peak by 2030, considering the room for growth.\n\nFor starters, let\u2019s talk about what went wrong here. The bearish sentiment behind SNAP stock is due to the company\u2019s weak financials in the near term. Social media companies like Snapchat rely primarily on advertising revenue, which slumped considerably after the boom in 2021. However, it has returned to a more sustainable trajectory which Snapchat\u2019s financials will also follow.\n\nThat\u2019s not all. Snapchat is yet to fully maximize its ad potential. Facebook\u2019s average revenue per user is $9.62 worldwide, while Snapchat\u2019s is just $2.58. This is the primary metric the company needs to work on to reverse the sentiment, and it will not be too hard to do so if the ad market cooperates. At the same time, Snapchat\u2019s daily active user base has been growing at a blistering speed and is at 383 million compared to 218 million in the pre-pandemic period.\n\nMy point is that its current financials shouldn\u2019t bear too much weight right now. I\u2019m confident the company can pull off strong growth by 2030 by adjusting its ARPU. The ad market\u2019s bounce will also take some patience, but it will inevitably happen. Further, catalysts like a TikTok ban (a real possibility by 2030) will considerably boost Snapchat.\n\nAll things considered, SNAP is one of the best tech stocks to buy now, and a steal in my book.\n\nUnity Software (U) In this photo illustration Unity Software Inc. (U stock) logo is seen on a mobile phone and a computer screen.\n\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock.com\n\nUnity Software (NYSE:U) specializes in video game software development. The stock has continued to languish near the $30 level, but I believe the bottom is in. There are several reasons to believe that the stock could rally much higher.\n\nUnity has shown strong sales growth, with revenue increasing by 56% year-over-year in Q1 2023, and revenue is estimated to hit $2.6 billion by the end of 2024. This growth is likely to continue as Unity\u2019s game development engine remains the most popular tool for game developers, even with the Unreal Engine making some ground regarding higher-end games.\n\nMoreover, if Unity\u2019s financials remain consistent, the stock could very well see a 10x price appreciation by 2030. The gaming industry will only keep growing in the long run, with Gen Z and Gen Alpha getting more and more sway over the market. Thus, U is among the best tech stocks to buy now as there\u2019s little downside risk with substantial upside potential.\n\nLuminar Technologies (LAZR) Luminar (LAZR stock) sign with greenery around it\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto/shutterstock.com\n\nLuminar Technologies (NASDAQ:LAZR) is a tech company that will benefit from the ongoing electric vehicle boom. EVs are the future, whether it may take 10 or 20 years, and EV companies are increasingly embracing LiDAR technology for self-driving cars.\n\nLuminar specializes in the tech, considered superior to what EVs currently use today. Self-driving cars use other sensors to see, notably radars and cameras, but laser vision is hard to match. Radars are reliable but don\u2019t offer the resolution needed to pick out arms and legs. Cameras deliver the detail but require machine-learning software to translate 2D images into 3D understanding. Thus, I am confident that LiDAR is going to gain significant traction by 2030.\n\nIn fact, we are already seeing the adoption of LiDAR by companies like Volvo (OTCMKTS:VLVLY) and Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV). This has translated into strong sales growth for Luminar, which aims to grow its revenue by triple digits every year for the next five years.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Nvidia stock has more than doubled in value this year, rising about 114%. This is much higher than the industry average of 43.7%.\r\n\r\nThe outperformance is expected to continue if the chipmaker comes up with an earnings beat in its Q1 report. Additionally, Wall Street analysts have turned more bullish ahead of the chipmaker\u2019s quarterly earnings report. Given this, ETFs having the largest allocation to Nvidia could make compelling plays ahead of its earnings report. These include AXS Esoterica NextG Economy ETF WUGI, Pacer Data and Digital Revolution ETF TRFK, VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF SMH, The Spear Alpha ETF SPRX and Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF BOTZ.\n\nEarnings Whispers\n\nNvidia currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an Earnings ESP of +2.43%. According to our methodology, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 increases the chances of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\r\n\r\nThis videogame-gear specialist saw no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Nvidia\u2019s earnings surprise history is not impressive. It delivered a negative earnings surprise of 3.20%, on average, in the last four quarters. Nvidia is expected to post earnings and revenue decline of 32.3% and 21.5%, respectively, for the to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the average target price is $279.19, with nearly 81% of the analysts giving a Strong Buy or a Buy rating ahead of NVDA earnings.\n\nWhat\u2019s Hot?\n\nThe chipmaker is at the center of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) feeding frenzy, which is making Wall Street bullish on the semiconductor specialist ahead of its earnings. The couple of the analysts \u2014 Oppenheimer and Susquehanna \u2014 raised the price targets for the stock. Analysts are optimistic about Nvidia AI-geared graphics processing units.\r\n\r\nPer the yahoo finance article, hedge funds have increased exposure to NVDA as the chipmaker continues to win large-volume orders for its AI chips and growing GPU order momentum in the gaming market (read: Guide to Artificial Intelligence ETFs).\r\n\r\nFor the first quarter of fiscal 2024, the graphics chipmaker expects revenues of around $6.5 billion, plus or minus 2%. Nvidia believes demand for its artificial intelligence and data-center chips will remain strong though it continues to struggle with a slowdown in the personal computer market.\n\nStory continues\n\nETFs in Focus\n\nLet\u2019s delve into each ETF below:\r\n\r\nAXS Esoterica NextG Economy ETF (WUGI)\r\n\r\nAXS Esoterica NextG Economy ETF is an actively managed ETF that invests in stocks of companies that benefit from the ever-evolving digital economy.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $6.09 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 8.1%.\n\nOn a non-GAAP basis, Intuit anticipates earnings per share in the range of $8.42-$8.49. The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at $8.45 per share, suggesting a year-over-year rise of 10.5%.\n\nIntuit Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Intuit Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nIntuit Inc. price-eps-surprise | Intuit Inc. Quote\n\nKey Factors at Play\n\nThe gradual recovery in Small Business and Self-Employed is expected to have contributed to the top line in the quarter under review. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Small Business\u2019 quarterly revenues is pegged at $1.94 billion. In the last quarter, the business unit grew 20%, driven by solid customer growth in QuickBooks Online payroll, Mailchimp and QuickBooks Online payments.\n\nIntuit\u2019s fiscal third-quarter revenues are likely to have witnessed solid growth in the Online Ecosystem, driven by an expanding subscriber base for Quickbooks Online and ARPC. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total Online Ecosystem\u2019s revenues is pegged at $1.44 billion for the quarter under review, indicating a 21.1% rise from the prior year's reported figure. The consensus mark for Quickbooks Online\u2019s revenues is pegged at $715 million, suggesting a 23.7% year-over-year improvement. The Online Ecosystem is likely to have boosted overall sales in the third quarter.\n\nThe solid momentum of INTU\u2019s leading product, QuickBooks Capital and improving customer retention rates are anticipated to have acted as tailwinds in the fiscal third quarter.\n\nIn the fiscal third quarter, new customer addition and extension filers are likely to boost revenues from the company\u2019s Consumer tax business. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Consumer tax business\u2019 revenues is pegged at $3.52 billion, higher than the year-ago quarter\u2019s reported figure of $3.24 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, due to the ongoing macroeconomic volatility, Intuit business partners have been pulling back from extending their credit, risking credit performance deterioration in the near term. This is expected to have led to lower Credit Karma revenues in the quarter to be reported. The business unit contributed $375 million to INTU\u2019s second-quarter fiscal 2023 total revenues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Credit Karma\u2019s third-quarter revenues is pegged at $377 million, indicating a year-over-year decline of 19.4%.\n\nWhat Our Model Says\n\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Intuit this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. However, that\u2019s not the case here.\n\nINTU has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3 at present. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nStocks With the Favorable Combination\n\nPer our model, HP HPQ, NVIDIA Corporation NVDA and Ulta Beauty ULTA have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the upcoming releases.\n\nCurrently, HP has an Earnings ESP of +1.85% and carries a Zacks Rank #2. The company is scheduled to report its second-quarter fiscal 2023 results on May 30. HPQ\u2019s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average earnings surprise of 1.1%. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for HP\u2019s fiscal second-quarter earnings is 76 cents per share, indicating a year-over-year decline of 29.6%. The company is estimated to report revenues of $13.07 billion, which suggests a drop of 20.7% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nNVIDIA has an Earnings ESP of +2.43% and carries a Zacks Rank #3 at present. The company is scheduled to report its first-quarter fiscal 2024 results on May 24. The company\u2019s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, missing twice, the average surprise being negative 3.2%.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for NVDA\u2019s fiscal first-quarter earnings is pegged at 92 cents per share, indicating a 32.4% drop from the year-ago quarter\u2019s $1.36. The consensus mark for revenues is $6.51 billion, suggesting a year-over-year decrease of 21.5%.\n\nUlta Beauty has an Earnings ESP of +0.66% and carries a Zacks Rank #3 at present.

The Cyberspace Administration of China flagged serious cybersecurity issues posed by Micron products and potential risk to the country's key information supply chains, Financial Times\u00a0reports. The regulator urged domestic firms that provide \"key information infrastructure\" to stop buying from Micron.

The U.S. also prohibited\u00a0Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA) from exporting H100, its state-of-the-art GPU for generative AI training, to China. Analysts said Micron is an obvious first target for Beijing as competitors' chips from South Korean rivals\u00a0Samsung Electronics Co, Ltd (OTC: SSNLF) and SK Hynix could easily replace the former. In April, the White House asked South Korea to urge its chipmakers not to fill any market gap in China if they\u00a0restricted Micron products. Beijing's ruling follows the G7's stark denunciation of China during the annual meeting of global leaders in Hiroshima. Analysts warned against a domino effect from Chinese companies that did not provide \"critical information infrastructure\" to seek to eliminate Micron from their supply chains.

This is often because a given stock has one or more catalysts that have led to a rally in its share price. Catalysts can include strong earnings, regulatory approval of a new product or service, a sizable stake taken by a notable investor. Additionally, there can be hype surrounding a particular economic sector, company or product that\u2019s driving investor demand.\n\nNotably, momentum typically indicates underlying strength in a stock. For investors, there is nothing better than when a stock they own builds momentum and the share price continues to rise. However, it is important to stay on top of such stocks. Often times, momentum can quickly dissipate. Circumstances can change, and a single bad earnings report can lead to a quick selloff. Thus, the goal is to ride momentum stocks for as long as possible. Investors need to remember to take profits, and exit such positions accordingly.\n\nWith that said, here are the three best momentum stocks to buy in May 2023.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCOF Capital One $97.93 NVDA Nvidia $312.64 LLY Eli Lilly $442.38\n\nCapital One (COF) A street view of a Capital One (COF) bank location in New York City.\n\nSource: Northfoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nWarren Buffett still has a lot of sway. This is evident in the share price of Capital One Financial Corp. (NYSE:COF), the company that is best known for its credit cards, but also functions as a full-service bank. COF stock has gained 10% since it was disclosed in a regulatory filing on May 15 that Buffett opened a new position in the stock during this year\u2019s first quarter. Through his holding company, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B), Buffett bought 9.92 million shares of Capital One, worth about $950 million.\n\nNews that Buffett has invested in COF stock led it to rebound from levels near its 52-week low. Like most bank stocks, Capital One had been dragged lower in recent months following the high-profile failures of several regional U.S. lenders. However, the stock now appears to have wind in its sales and is climbing higher.\n\nIncidentally, Buffett wasn\u2019t the only well-known investor to buy Capital One stock in Q1. It was also disclosed that Michael Burry of The Big Short fame also opened a new position in COF stock in the first three months of the year.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) logo on phone screen stock image.\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\nUp 120% in less than five months, shares of microchip and semiconductor company Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) look unstoppable right now. The company is riding momentum around both artificial intelligence and cloud computing, with analysts noting that Nvidia\u2019s chips are essential for both industries. NVDA stock has been gathering steam in the lead-up to its next quarterly earnings print scheduled for May 24. Demand for its chips among A.I. firms and cloud computing servers is expected to lead the company to revise its outlook for the year higher.\n\nInvestment bank Oppenheimer & Co. (NYSE:OPY) recently maintained its buy rating and increased its price target on NVDA stock to $350 a share from $300, noting that AI momentum is likely to continue for the foreseeable future. The company is doing its best to capitalize on the hype surrounding artificial intelligence, as well as strong demand for cloud computing.\n\nThe big question now is whether Nvidia\u2019s upcoming earnings will be able to match the red hot expectations of analysts and investors. I think more upside could be on the horizon, if investors continue to look for ways to play this incredible trend.\n\nEli Lilly (LLY) Eli Lilly and Company World Headquarters. Lilly makes Medicines and Pharmaceuticals XI\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nShares of pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) have gained nearly 50% over the last 12 months. This includes a 20% gain so far this year.\n\nMomentum has been building behind LLY stock due to expectations for its weight loss drug called Tirzepatide. Speculation is that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will approve the medication for widespread use by year\u2019s end. Most analysts expect Tirzepatide, which is also called Mounjaro, to be the next blockbuster pharmaceutical. Some are going so far as to predict that it will become the best-selling medication of all time.\n\nEli Lilly is pulling out all the stops to prepare for FDA approval of Tirzepatide, expanding its existing manufacturing capacity and investing in advertising campaigns. Tirzepatide has already been approved for use as a diabetes treatment, and its approval for weight loss is viewed by many as inevitable, potentially giving Eli Lilly a windfall in new sales. The most recent data from clinical trials of the drug have been very encouraging, leading investors to pile into LLY stock before it potentially skyrockets.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in NVDA and LLY.

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.\n\nThat is because NVIDIA is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings \u2014 with the most up-to-date information possible \u2014 is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for NVDA in this report.\n\nIn fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 94 cents per share for NVDA, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 92 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for NVDA, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +2.43% heading into earnings season.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation Price and EPS Surprise NVIDIA Corporation Price and EPS Surprise\n\nNVIDIA Corporation price-eps-surprise | NVIDIA Corporation Quote\n\nWhy is this Important?\n\nA positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).\n\nGiven that NVDA has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nClearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for NVIDIA, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

By comparison, the S&P 500 trades on a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 18.8 times.\n\nIn effect, investors are banking on Nvidia to grow its future earnings by more than three times the rate of the S&P 500.\n\nThat's a tall order.\n\nOn a trailing 12-month basis, Nvidia's stock trades on an exorbitant 117 times enterprise value to EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) multiple. Zooming in on the trailing price-to-sales ratio, investors are greeted with a lofty 27 times multiple.\n\nOut of the 57 sell-side analysts that cover Nvidia, 77% rate the stock a buy. There are zero sell ratings on Nvidia's stock on Wall Street.\n\nSo why the major optimism on Nvidia? Look no further than what Nvidia is building on the supercomputing and AI fronts.

(Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nMonday brought news out of Germany, where Reuters reported the company unveiled a new supercomputer in partnership with Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) at a supercomputing conference. The computer \u2014 called Isambard 3 \u2014 is based on Nvidia's new high-powered Grace CPU chips.\n\nThe Grace CPU chips take aim at similar ones offered by AMD and Intel.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeantime, OpenAI's popular generative AI platform ChatGPT was developed using Nvidia GPUs.\n\nAnd at its GTC conference in March, Nvidia showed off a host of solutions for training and deploying complex models inherent to generative AI.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing an acceleration in demand,\u201d Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang told Yahoo Finance Live. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing an acceleration of demand for our DGX AI supercomputers. We\u2019re seeing an acceleration of demand for inference, because of generative AI.\u201d\n\nWall Street's read is that Nvidia is a \"one-stop solution provider\" for all things tied to the hot generative AI movement, potentially leading to bumper profits well into the future.\n\n\"With leading silicon (GPU/DPU/Networking), hardware/software platforms, and a strong ecosystem, Nvidia is well-positioned to continue to benefit from major secular trends in AI, high performance computing, gaming, and autonomous vehicles, in our view,\" JP Morgan analyst Harlan Sur wrote in a research note.\n\nAdded Sur: \"Bottom line: Nvidia continues to be 1-2 steps ahead of its competitors in accelerated computing silicon/systems, software, and ecosystems.\"\n\nThese Nvidia bulls will be put to the test this week on two fronts.\n\nThe company's AI technology is rumored to be on display at Microsoft's (MSFT) three-day developer conference that kicks off mid-week. And earnings are out after the close of trading on Wednesday.\n\nThere is some chatter on the Street that no matter what Nvidia does this week, a pause in the stock price may be warranted due to those aforementioned heroic valuations.\n\nWarns Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya: \"Post-earnings volatility [on Nvidia] it to be expected given sky-high expectations and the stock's 97% return year to date (vs. Philadelphia Semiconductor Index up 18%).\"\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. As with many other companies NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) makes use of debt. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?\n\nWhy Does Debt Bring Risk?\n\nDebt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for NVIDIA\n\nHow Much Debt Does NVIDIA Carry?\n\nThe chart below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that NVIDIA had US$11.0b in debt in January 2023; about the same as the year before. However, its balance sheet shows it holds US$13.3b in cash, so it actually has US$2.34b net cash. debt-equity-history-analysis\n\nHow Healthy Is NVIDIA's Balance Sheet?\n\nZooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that NVIDIA had liabilities of US$6.56b due within 12 months and liabilities of US$12.5b due beyond that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$13.3b and US$3.83b worth of receivables due within a year. So its liabilities total US$1.96b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.\n\nHaving regard to NVIDIA's size, it seems that its liquid assets are well balanced with its total liabilities. So while it's hard to imagine that the US$773.2b company is struggling for cash, we still think it's worth monitoring its balance sheet. Despite its noteworthy liabilities, NVIDIA boasts net cash, so it's fair to say it does not have a heavy debt load!\n\nStory continues\n\nIt is just as well that NVIDIA's load is not too heavy, because its EBIT was down 44% over the last year. Falling earnings (if the trend continues) could eventually make even modest debt quite risky. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine NVIDIA's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.\n\nBut our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash. While NVIDIA has net cash on its balance sheet, it's still worth taking a look at its ability to convert earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, to help us understand how quickly it is building (or eroding) that cash balance. Over the last three years, NVIDIA recorded free cash flow worth a fulsome 82% of its EBIT, which is stronger than we'd usually expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.\n\nSumming Up\n\nWe could understand if investors are concerned about NVIDIA's liabilities, but we can be reassured by the fact it has has net cash of US$2.34b. The cherry on top was that in converted 82% of that EBIT to free cash flow, bringing in US$3.8b. So we don't have any problem with NVIDIA's use of debt. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. Be aware that  NVIDIA is showing  3 warning signs in our investment analysis, you should know about...\n\nWhen all is said and done, sometimes its easier to focus on companies that don't even need debt.

In a statement, China\u2019s cybersecurity regulator revealed that the U.S.-based memory chipmaker has failed to pass a cybersecurity review, which it had initiated in late March 2023.\n\nThe development can be seen as a retaliatory action by the Chinese government against the U.S. government\u2019s increasing restrictions on Chinese access to critical and more advanced semiconductor technology.\n\nIn October 2022, the United States imposed an export ban on certain advanced chips that are used in data centers for artificial intelligence, data analytics and computing applications. Over the past few months, the Netherlands and Japan also joined the United States to restrict China from making advanced chips.\n\nMicron Technology, Inc. Price and Consensus Micron Technology, Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nMicron Technology, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Micron Technology, Inc. Quote\n\nThe tit-for-tat actions could jeopardize Micron\u2019s prospects, which are already facing the brunt of the weak demand for its memory chips. Chip sales in China make up approximately 11% of Micron\u2019s total revenues.\n\nIn late March, Micron reported weaker-than-expected financial results in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. The company reported a non-GAAP loss of $1.91 per share, which was significantly higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 67 cents. The bottom line compared unfavorably with the prior-year quarter\u2019s earnings of $2.14 per share.\n\nThe quarterly revenues of Micron plunged 53% year over year to $3.69 billion, which missed the consensus mark of $3.76 billion. The rapidly weakening consumer demand and substantial customer inventory adjustments across end markets amid macroeconomic uncertainty were the main reasons behind the dismal quarterly performance.\n\nThe memory chip maker has offices in Shanghai and Shenzhen and a chip packaging facility in the city of Xian. In early 2022, Micron announced that it would shut down DRAM design operations at its Shanghai facility by the end of the year. The move was seen as a strategic shift from the manufacturing of chips back to the United States amid mounting trade tensions between the United States and China.\n\nStory continues\n\nMU is not the only semiconductor company that has been impacted by the tech war between the world\u2019s two largest economies. On Aug 31, 2022, NVIDIA Corporation NVDA disclosed that the U.S. government informed it on Aug 26 about imposing a new licensing requirement, effective immediately, for its A100, A100X and forthcoming H100 integrated circuit sales in China and Russia. The government also banned NVIDIA from exporting DGX or any other systems that incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits.\n\nThe new licensing requirements will also be implied for any future chip designs developed by NVIDIA that have a threshold greater than or equivalent to A100. Additionally, any systems developed in the future incorporating the aforementioned types and thresholds will fall under export restrictions.\n\nZacks Rank & Stocks to Consider\n\nCurrently, Micron and NVIDIA each carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Shares of MU and NVDA have rallied 36.4% and 114%, respectively, year to date (YTD).\n\nSome better-ranked stocks from the broader technology sector are Meta Platforms META and Manhattan Associates MANH, each sporting a sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

In fact, taking Bitcoin\u2019s lead this year, RIOT exploded from about $3.30 to $11.07. From here, I\u2019d like to see it closer to $23, which it tested in early 2022.\n\nWhile the company\u2019s first-quarter total revenue dropped to $73.2 million from $79.8 million year over year, that was to be expected. Especially when the price of Bitcoin falls 44% year over year, as well.\n\nHowever, as Bitcoin regains even more lost ground, so should RIOT.\u00a0Even better, in April, the company produced another 639 Bitcoin, an increase of 26% year over year.

With the release of ChatGPT, and the explosion of AI-powered natural language into the realm of online search, content creation, and even picture editing, it\u2019s become clear that AI is the next frontier of the tech space.\n\nA sudden boom of this sort will always bring opportunities with it. New jobs and new products, of course \u2013 but also renewed opportunities in the stock market. Companies related to AI, either directly or through connections to high-profile applications such as ChatGPT, will find or forge new paths, and they\u2019ll be hungry for investors.\n\nInvestors, however, will need to take care in choosing where to put their funds. Some AI-related firms are more equal than others, and some careful sorting is in order before buying in. That brings us to the Smart Score, the AI-powered tool from TipRanks that collects and collates all the data on more than 8,400 publicly traded equities, and rates them according to 8 factors that are strongly correlated with future outperformance. The combined score is given according to a simple linear scale, 1 to 10, with a \u2018perfect 10\u2019 indicating a stock that clearly deserves a closer look.\n\nSo let\u2019s look up some AI stocks according to their Smart Scores \u2013 the combination of a Perfect 10 with a strong connection to AI/ChatGPT should make a solid starting point for today\u2019s tech investments. Here are two such stocks, presented along with comments from the Wall Street analysts.\n\nPerion Network, Ltd. (PERI)\n\nWe\u2019ll start with Perion Network, an innovative leader in the global digital advertising business. The company focuses on increasing engagement for its clients, through ad search, social media, and video/CTV content, and estimates its potential market as $300 billion or more. That\u2019s not peanuts, so a big opportunity there for Perion.\n\nThe company is already part of a strategic relationship with Microsoft and its Bing search engine, and that leads to its direct AI connection. Microsoft has publicly gone big on AI and ChatGPT as the base for improving and upgrading Bing; Perion and Bing work together in a strategic partnership for search engine advertising. In fact, Perion\u2019s earnings show a strong correlation with\u00a0 Bing\u2019s user numbers \u2013 and the integration of ChatGPT into Bing has already had a strong effect on Perion\u2019s financial results.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat was visible in Perion\u2019s last quarterly report, for 1Q23 \u2013 the first full quarter after the release of ChatGPT. The company showed a 16% year-over-year increase in total revenue, jumping from $125.3 million to $145.2 million. This total included y/y increases of 16% in \u2018display advertising revenue\u2019 and 15% in \u2018search advertising revenue.\u2019 At the bottom line, Perion\u2019s non-GAAP net income grew 44% y/y, to reach $29.9 million; this gave an EPS figure of 60 cents per share, up 36% from the 44 cents reported in the year-ago quarter.\n\nIn addition to solid y/y growth, the company\u2019s results also came in higher than expected. Perion\u2019s revenue total beat the forecast by $3.8 million, and the non-GAAP EPS was 10 cents higher than the estimates.\n\nVideo revenue provided a large share of Perion\u2019s growth, with a 26% y/y increase. Vid revenue made up 44% of the total display advertising revenue, an increase from the 41% in the prior-year quarter. This growth was supported by a 63% y/y increase in the number of video platform publishers.\n\nTurning to PERI\u2019s Smart Score, we find that Perion checks nearly all the boxes. The stock has sound technical and fundamental factors, but the biggest boost comes from the sentiment measures. The financial bloggers are 100% positive on PERI, compared to a 67% sector average;\u00a0 the news sentiment is 100% positive, as well; the crowd wisdom on PERI registers \u2018very positive,\u2019 as individual investors have increased their holdings in the shares by 42% in the last 30 days. And, of the hedge funds tracked by TipRanks, PERI holdings were up more than 344,000 shares last quarter. This all adds up to a Perfect 10.\n\nThe Street\u2019s analysts are also bullish. Needham\u2019s Laura Martin, an expert in the tech sector, sums up the prospects for Perion: \u201cOf all the public AdTech companies, PERI has the most near-term upside from ChatGPT because it distributes Bing (owned by Microsoft) in 60 countries, including the US, Canada, India, UK, etc. In 1Q23, PERI reported nearly 30mm monetized searches per day, out of a total of 150mm searches. PERI gets a rev share of the Bing ad revs from its clients in these countries. In 1Q23, PERI reported that 45% of its total revs were from its Bing search affiliates, up 15% y/y.\u201d\n\nMartin\u2019s comments back up her Buy rating on the stock, while her $42 price target indicates her confidence in a 37% share appreciation over the next 12 months. (To watch Martin\u2019s track record, click here.)\n\nThere are 5 recent analyst reviews on Perion and they break down 4 to 1 in favor of Buy over Hold, to give the stock its Strong Buy consensus rating. The shares are currently trading for $30.63 and the $40.20 average price target implies a one-year upside potential of 31%. (See Perion\u2019s stock forecast.)\n\nNvidia Corporation (NVDA)\n\nFor the second stock on our list, we\u2019ll shift gears slightly and look at one of the leaders in the world\u2019s semiconductor chip industry. Nvidia has built a solid reputation in the graphics processing unit (GPU) segment, and holds approximately 70% market share in these high-end chips. The strong market share in GPUs has benefited Nvidia greatly in recent years; GPUs are in high demand from both professional graphic designers and serious online gamers. In addition, GPU\u2019s high computing capacity has found application in AI and machine learning systems, as well as data processing, \u2018smart\u2019 home and city technology, and IoT.\n\nThat\u2019s the good news. The bad news is that, post-pandemic, Nvidia\u2019s gaming segment slid through much of fiscal year 2023, hurting the company\u2019s revenues and earnings. In the most recent quarter, the company did report a rebound in gaming, and importantly, it detailed ongoing moves into the AI sector, making the company well-positioned to benefit from this secular trend.\n\nIn the fiscal year 2023, which ended on January 29 of this calendar year, the company reported a top line of $26.97 billion, essentially flat from the $26.91 billion reported in fiscal 2022. Nvidia\u2019s sales growth dropped off starting in the second fiscal quarter, and in the last reported quarter, fiscal 4Q23, the company\u2019s top line of $6.05 billion, was down 21% y/y. At the bottom line, the non-GAAP EPS was reported at 88 cents, compared to $1.32 in the prior-year period. It should be noted, however, that both the top-and bottom-line results beat expectations.\n\nOn the AI side, Nvidia has made its AI platform available as a cloud offering in partnership with leading cloud software providers, including Microsoft and Google. AI chips feature prominently in Nvidia\u2019s data center business, which is responsible for the bulk of revenue \u2013 and saw an 11% increase y/y to $3.62 billion in FQ4. The automotive and robotics segment of Nvidia\u2019s business, which is also tied to AI and includes cloud access, showed gains y/y, growing 135% from fiscal 4Q22 to reach $294 million.\n\nInvestors have bought into the NVDA AI story, and the shares are up by 114% year-to-date. This jibes well with the strong sentiment factors in the \u2018Perfect 10\u2019 Smart Score. Nvidia scores high on blogger sentiment (71% positive), on crown wisdom (holdings up 5.6% in the last 30 days), and on news sentiment (97% positive). The hedges increased their shares in Nvidia by 2.5 million last quarter, a clear sign of confidence.\n\nSo, it\u2019s no wonder that this stock caught the attention of HSBC analyst Frank Lee, who is somewhat taken aback by the opportunity at play. He writes, \u201cWe\u2019re shocked by Nvidia\u2019s pricing power on AI chips that we see driving earnings upside, higher valuation\u2026\u00a0Given the aggressive rollout of ChatGPT by Microsoft as well as other AI initiatives from US and Chinese cloud service providers, we expect AI GPUs could contribute additional revenue of USD5.2bn and USD11.1bn in FY1/24e and FY1/25e\u2026\u00a0We also acknowledge further re-rating potential on Nvidia\u2019s market dominance (>80% market share) and the fact that it is a prime beneficiary of the AI trend.\u201d\n\nLee goes on to rate NVDA as a Buy, and he sets a $355 price target to suggest a 13% upside in the coming months. (To watch Lee\u2019s track record, click here.)\n\nOf the 37 recent analyst reviews on file for NVDA, 29 are to Buy and 8 are to Hold \u2013 for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The shares\u2019 rapid increase this year, however, has pushed the trading price above the average price forecast; Nvidia is trading for $312.64, but the analysts\u2019 average price prediction currently stands at $296.29.

On Sunday before departing the G-7, Biden called the GOP's debt-ceiling stance \"unacceptable,\" adding it was \"time for the other side to move from their extreme positions.\" This as Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen's June 1 \"X-date\" looms.\n\nOn Friday, the two parties put talks on pause, raising doubts about the near-term potential for a deal and sending markets lower.\n\nAll three major indexes still finished the week with gains, however, notably the Nasdaq, which rose more than 3%.\n\nThe Nasdaq and S&P 500 had their best week since March and their highest weekly close since August 2022. Year to date, the Nasdaq is up more than 20%, while the S&P 500 has risen more than 9%; the Dow Jones Industrial Average is just barely clinging to gains for the year.\n\nStocks were encouraged last week after earnings from the retail sector struck a cautious tone on consumer spending for the year, but didn't sound alarms on a full-on recession quite yet.\n\nIn the week ahead, results from Dollar General (DG), Costco (COST), and BJ's (BJ) will offer further insights on the health of the consumer.

So for value retail, I think it's a positive.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the tech front, Nvidia (NVDA), which has seen its stock more than 100% this year, is expected to report earnings on Wednesday.\n\nOn the economic data front, investors will look for further hints on the Fed's path forward as investors prep for the end of the central bank's most aggressive rate hiking campaign since the early '80s.\n\nOn Thursday, the second estimate of first quarter GDP will offer a look at growth in the first quarter and another check on the central bank's preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, for Q1.\n\nEconomists expect \"core\" PCE \u2014 which strips out the more volatile costs of food and energy \u2014 rose 4.9% on an annual basis in the first quarter, unchanged from the first reading; \"core\" PCE is expected to have risen 0.3% in April, a monthly increase unchanged from March.\n\nBut the debt ceiling will remain the biggest factor for investors until a resolution on the current negotiations can be reached.\n\nTraditionally, markets have been more volatile as the \"X-date\" \u2014 or the date at which the US would default on its obligations \u2014 nears, with the possibility of default weighing on markets most in the two weeks before this date.

REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\n\"If the X-date is crossed without a formal default, we see the drop in Q2 deepening a further 5% to 3750, but proving temporary,\" UBS's global economics and strategy team wrote in a note to clients on Friday.\n\n\"A 1-week period of no coupon payment and default would trigger up to a 20% drop in stocks towards 3,400, and keep them suppressed at those low levels through Q3 before making a partial recovery towards 3.800 by year end. The very unlikely scenario of a month long non payment of coupon would not only cause an immediate drop of up to 30% in stocks, it would also see a very weak recovery.\"\n\nThe S&P 500 closed at 4,191 on Friday.\n\nDebt ceiling discussions will also take a bigger place in the investor conversation going forward as this week wraps up earnings season.\n\nEntering Friday, 94% of the S&P 500 had reported earnings. On average, companies have been beating estimates by 6.5%, per Evercore ISI, while reporting an earnings decline for the second straight quarter.\n\nStill, stocks are up since the start of the first quarter earning season and the much discussed looming recession hasn't impacted markets yet.\n\n\u201cIn thinking about the timing of a Recession, the Consumer remains key,\u201d Julian Emmanuel, who leads Evercore ISI's equity and portfolio strategy, wrote in a note to clients on Friday.\n\n\"A resilient Consumer was largely the theme in 1Q results, though Banks and Retailers bookending Earnings Season did note some deceleration later in the quarter. Waning momentum could put renewed pressure on estimates in line with historical revision trends.\"\n\nWeekly Calendar\n\nMonday\n\nEconomic data: No notable economic data set for release.\n\nEarnings: Ryanair (RYAAY), Zoom (ZM)\n\nTuesday\n\nEconomic data: S&P Global US manufacturing PMI, May, preliminary reading (50.0 expected, 50.2 previously); S&P Global US Services PMI, May, preliminary reading (53.6 previously); New home sales, April (660,000 annualized rate expected, 683,000 previously); New home sales, month-over-month, April (-3.4% expected, +9.6% previously);\n\nEarnings:  Autozone(AZO), BJ's Wholesale Club (BJ), Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), Intuit (INTU), Lowe's (L), Willams & Sonoma (WSM), Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Toll Brothers (TOL), Urban Outfitters (URBN)\n\nWednesday\n\nEconomic data: MBA Mortgage Applications (-5.7% previously); FOMC minutes\n\nEarnings: Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF), BMO (BMO), e.l.f.
