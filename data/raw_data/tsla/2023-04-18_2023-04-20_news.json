Price cuts beginning to weigh on the EV giant's profit margins. And, Dave, we know, the profit margin, that was one of the key metrics within this report that the Street was closely watching because of those price cuts. But it disappointed the Street, coming in even much lower than what the consensus was out there, and that's why we're seeing such a huge hit to the stock right now.\n\nDAVE BRIGGS: And what was interesting is to watch the domestics, because GM is down 3% on this news, Ford is down just shy of 3% on this news, and fair to ask why on the surface, presumably, they think they'll have to lower their prices in the EV space, which will cut into their already small margins on their E-vehicles.\n\nOn the flip side though, if you look inside Ford and GM's numbers, their margins are really not on EVs right now. They're hardly selling any of those. Their money is all coming from SUVs and trucks, and their margins will not be at all impacted by what Elon Musk is doing. But nonetheless, that is the presumption.\n\nInteresting to hear Dan Ives agree with the sentiment earlier that perhaps it's time to advertise. I mentioned GM and Ford, who both spend north of $2 billion a year on marketing, and Elon continues to zero out on the ad budget.\n\nSEANA SMITH: Yeah, and it's something that we heard from Ross Gerber yesterday, just talking about how he wants more of an expansion of the brand, to grow Tesla into that global brand. It's something that he's talked about on Yahoo Finance in the past, comparing what Tesla's brand is to what Apple's is on a global scale. But when you take a look at these numbers, lots of debate about whether or not these price cuts are going to be worth it.\n\nIves, however, is on the side that it's going to be some near-term pain for long-term gain. He's really pointing to some of the demand over in China. He thinks that is going to be a critical catalyst here for Tesla at least in the near term. He did, though, lower his price target, so I think the Street is kind of rethinking exactly what Tesla's numbers, at least, are going to look like over the coming quarters.\n\nDAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, does that Amazon model really worked out in the end?

Since hitting the scene in November 2022, ChatGPT has blown up in popularity. It garnered millions of subscribers in record time and new platforms seem to pop up overnight.\n\nThere\u2019s no question that AI is transforming the way that we\u2019re using technology. It\u2019s not a fad and it\u2019s not going away. Rules will likely be put in place, or there will be an attempt to, but as the saying goes \u201cthe cat is out of the bag.\u201d\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSo now the big question is how can investors position themselves to take advantage?\n\nInvesco QQQ Trust Series (QQQ) Man in blue shirt presents open hand with bulb concept floating above palm, innovation background.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nI would start with the Invesco QQQ Trust Series ETF (NASDAQ:QQQ). While this ETF is hardly obscure and is one of the most popular trading vehicles in the market. It is a worthy consideration when looking for AI ETFs to buy.\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the top holding in QQQ, with a weighting of 12.63%. The tech giant has been positioning itself to have a great foothold in the AI space.\n\nAs soon as ChatGPT showed off its stuff, Microsoft moved quickly to make a multi-billion dollar investment in the platform\u2019s parent company, OpenAI. Now Microsoft is working to integrate AI into its search and browser products, as well as its other platforms aimed at enterprise use.\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is another top holding in QQQ, coming in as the fourth-largest holding. Nvidia produces the hardware that makes AI possible. While others will eventually enter its domain, Nvidia is the king of AI chips for the moment.\n\nVanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) Close-up Presentation of a New Generation Microchip. Gloved Hand Holding Piece of Technological Wonder. Semiconductor stocks are in the news.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAnother ETF where Nvidia is a top holding? The VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH). Only in this case, Nvidia is the top holding in the fund, with a 13.66% weighting. The next largest company in the ETF is Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) with an 11.57% weighting.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat\u2019s significant, as a quarter of the ETF is tied up in two stocks. More than 64% of SMH is invested in its top 10 holdings. So why am I picking this ETF? Put simply by Forbes:\n\n\u201cIf you want investing exposure to artificial intelligence (AI) without betting on young, unproven companies, semiconductors may be your angle. Semiconductors are the building blocks of AI applications\u2014so as AI adoption grows, so does the demand for semiconductors.\u201d\n\nNone of this is possible without semiconductors and the strain and demand from new technology using AI applications is going to be intense. That means better chips, higher-end components and all-around stronger demand for the parts produced by semiconductor companies.\n\nGlobal X Autonomous And Electric Vehicles ETF (DRIV) Businessman show business growth investment stock finance profit graph of marketing financial increase trade chart.

While the name of the fund would lead you to believe that this is simply geared toward vehicles, it\u2019s got more AI exposure than you\u2019d think at first glance.\n\nFirst, its top holding is Nvidia.

Here's how much to saveThis is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home\n\nTesla has slashed the prices of some of its most popular models six times this year alone in an attempt to spur demand amid rising competition in the EV market, but analysts have cautioned that the tactic sacrifices margins. Investors got the first taste of what that might look like on Wednesday after the bell when Musk and company reported first-quarter earnings.\n\nWhile Tesla\u2019s revenue jumped 24% from a year ago in the first quarter to $23.3 billion, net income went in the other direction, sinking 24% to $2.51 billion. Price cuts also pushed the company\u2019s gross margins down from 23.8% last quarter to 19.3%, well below Wall Street\u2019s consensus estimate of 21.1%.\n\nOn top of that, Musk said in the follow-up earnings call that \u201cstormy weather\u201d lies ahead for the economy, which could cause consumers to postpone \u201cbig new capital purchases like a new car.\u201d He also noted that the Federal Reserve\u2019s rapid interest rate hikes have had a serious impact on affordability over the past year: \u201cEvery time that the Fed raises interest rates, that\u2019s the equivalent to an increase in the price of a car.\u201d\n\nMusk\u2019s comments and Tesla\u2019s latest earnings disappointment have pushed the once-beloved stock even deeper into what David Trainer calls the \u201cdanger zone.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter first-quarter earnings and another missed growth goal, we continue to see Tesla as one of the most overvalued stocks in the market,\u201d the CEO of investment research firm New Constructs warned in a Thursday note.\n\nStory continues\n\nTrainer believes investors are pricing in sales growth and automotive margins that aren\u2019t realistic, and with competition heating up, Tesla shares present a \u201cmajor downside risk.\u201d And he\u2019s serious when he says \u201cdownside,\u201d arguing the stock could drop as much as 80% to just $28 even under \u201coptimistic\u201d circumstances.\n\nFading growth, rising competition\n\nFor years, the booming EV market has enabled Tesla to rapidly increase its vehicle deliveries, and many analysts have argued that the trend will continue. But Trainer notes that Musk\u2019s EV giant hasn\u2019t been able to live up to its own lofty 50% year-over-year delivery growth goal.\n\nIn the first quarter, Tesla managed to deliver 440,808 vehicles, representing a 42% year-over-year delivery increase\u2014even amid aggressive price cuts. The missed delivery targets are largely due to the rise of Musk\u2019s EV competition, according to Trainer.\n\nFrom Volkswagen unveiling a flagship four-door ID.7 Monday and a mass-market, affordable EV last month to Toyota\u2019s promise to launch 10 new EV models by 2026, Tesla rivals are striving to take market share from Tesla.\n\n\u201cCompetition isn\u2019t going away, as legacy automakers have ample resources and cash flow to invest in the EV market for years to come,\u201d Trainer wrote Thursday. \u201cTesla faces an increasingly uphill battle to secure its competitive position, which makes its current valuation look even more unrealistic.\u201d\n\nA lofty valuation\n\nWhile Tesla has been hurt by rising EV competition, Trainer believes the main issue may be just how overvalued the stock is for investors. The EV giant trades at more than 45 times its trailing 12-month earnings, compared with the S&P 500 average of just 22.\n\nBut price/earnings ratios are often criticized by analysts because they fail to take into account a firm\u2019s future growth prospects. With this in mind, Trainer put forward another method to value Tesla that works backwards from a company\u2019s share price to determine how much cash flow they\u2019d need to generate to justify their current valuation, called a reverse discounted cash flow (DCF) model.\n\nHe found that for Tesla to be valued at $200 per share, it would have to sell as many as 30 million EVs by 2031. For reference, there were only 10.6 million EVs sold globally all of last year, according to the World Economic Forum. Trainer and his research team broke down multiple \u201cinarguably best-case scenarios\u201d for Tesla in their latest report, including one where the company becomes the largest automaker on the planet within a decade, and found that the stock is still \u201csignificantly overvalued.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s always another side to the story\u2026\n\nWhile even the most bullish of Tesla analysts now admit that the company is facing an \u201cEV price war,\u201d many still believe the stock can outperform. Tesla currently boasts 21 \u201cbuy\u201d ratings, 16 \u201chold\u201d ratings, and just five \u201csell\u201d ratings on the Street, according to data from the Wall Street Journal.\n\nIn a Thursday note, Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives cut his price target for Tesla from $225 to $215, but said he remains \u201cvery bullish\u201d on the firm\u2019s long-term story. He argued that Tesla posted \u201cmixed results\u201d in its latest earnings report, but admitted that the \u201celephant in the room\u201d is \u201csofter margins.\u201d Still, the analyst believes Musk\u2019s strategy to sacrifice margins in order to secure long-term demand gains will pay off in the long run.\n\nGene Munster, another bullish veteran analyst who now serves as a managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, pointed to the potential for growth in Tesla\u2019s full self-driving \u201crobotaxi\u201d business, and noted that Musk said the Cybertruck \u201cmay begin deliveries\u201d in the third quarter.\n\n\u201cIn the end, I believe the company will strike a balance between margins and growth,\u201d he wrote in a Wednesday note, arguing the company offers long-term upside.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nMore from Fortune: \r\n5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year\u2014all while working from home\r\nLooking to make extra cash?

So it's got huge volatility, short sellers like the volatility because they can get a big bang for their buck when the stock goes up or down. So when you see these huge losses, you'll see people getting squeezed in the stock and short sellers will cover. The thing with Tesla that's interesting is that when one person gets out, another person gets in. It's kinda like the WWE, keep getting tagged in.\n\nCraig Irwin (00:00:28 -> 00:00:51) - It's a great company, great products, love the fact that they pioneered this market, but there are a lot of other companies that are gonna be successful here too. And the valuation is egregious. EVs are inevitable. There's gonna be a lot of companies that are successful. There are going to be a lot of companies in the supply chain, either on the battery side or the component side that are going to be successful. I just don't think Tesla is the one to invest in here. I think there are other great names.\n\nStory continues\n\nDarren Palmer (00:00:52 -> 00:01:12) - Ford is all in on electrification. We are seeing massive demand for our products.

This CD has a 5.15% APY right nowBuying a house? Here's how much to saveThis is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home\n\nBut for one leading analyst, the selloff isn\u2019t remotely big enough to bring the EV king\u2019s shares in line with its fundamentals. David Trainer, founder and CEO of investment research firm New Constructs, believes that using the most realistic projections for the likes of sales and earnings, Tesla\u2019s worth something like $28 a share or one-sixth its current price\u2014which by the way, is down 60% from its peak of $415 reached in late 2021. \u201cTesla remains hugely overvalued,\u201d Trainer told Fortune, pointing to a $517 market cap that still amounts to twice the combined valuations of Toyota and Volkswagen.\n\nTrainer is unswayed by the narrative that Tesla\u2019s not mainly a car company but a tech juggernaut that will set the pace in self-driving vehicles and produce the next-gen batteries its rivals will rely on. Put simply, he believes that the flood of new, mostly bargain-priced models issued by every big competitor will substantially lower Tesla\u2019s profitability going forward. For Trainer, it\u2019s all about the numbers. First, what Tesla\u2019s future earning must equal to justify its current cap, and second, assessing its true value based on reasonable projections for sales and profits. In a new report, Trainer gives his estimates showing that Tesla flunks on both criteria.\n\nStory continues\n\nHow fast must Tesla grow to be worth a cap of over $500 billion?\n\nFor both exercises, Trainer uses one of the most reliable tools in finance, discounted cash flow analysis. To see what Tesla must do to merit an over half-a-trillion valuation, he plugged in the sales, profit, and capex numbers over the next eight years that discount back to that gigantic benchmark. For Tesla to get there, Trainer reckons that it must grow sales at a 28% compound rate through 2031, and achieve after-tax operating margins of 13%, 80% higher than Toyota\u2019s current level of 7%. Tesla also needs to keep capex growth at one-third of its current rate, despite the requirement of constantly building new factories to sustain that exploding output.\n\nIf it hits those supercharged metrics, Tesla would garner $100 billion in net operating profit by 2031, 60% more than Toyota, Stellantis, GM, and Ford all make combined, ascending to what Apple has earned in the past four quarters. Trainer\u2019s verdict: It\u2019s mission impossible. It won\u2019t happen.\n\nWhat\u2019s Tesla worth using optimistic but reasonable projections for its fundamentals?\n\nTrainer\u2019s \u201cmost likely\u201d scenario holds that Tesla will indeed get much bigger in the years ahead, but generate only slightly more profit than it books today. Once again, the big headwind will be the onslaught of low-priced EVs vying for the same customers. Trainer thinks it\u2019s probable that Tesla grows sales fast, at between 20% and 30% a year in 2023, 2024, and 2025, and at 10% in the five out years. The rub: He forecasts that its operating margins will fall from 13% in 2023 to 7% in the years beyond. Hence, its earnings won\u2019t grow much from here, despite fast-waxing sales.\n\nStill, Tesla would rank as an industry titan eight years hence, boasting annual sales of 4.5 million vehicles, 3.5 times the figure over the past four quarters. That\u2019s equal to 43% of all the Toyotas customers purchased in the past 12 months, and equal to all the newly bought Volkswagens. If Tesla manages to meet these still challenging numbers, Trainer believes its stock, at present, should be fetching $28 a share.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all playing out as we predicted in previous reports,\u201d Trainer told me. \u201cTesla\u2019s really admitting that the car business won\u2019t make the money Musk was projecting, and it\u2019s clear that claims the ancillary business will supply the needed extra growth are a shell game.\u201d Elon Musk, the Music Man of EVs, has built a great company but also sold followers on an incredibly overblown vision. In turn, the believers awarded Tesla an incredibly inflated market cap. Tesla can remain a great company. Its stock, Trainer argues backed by strong logic, is headed for disaster.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nMore from Fortune: \r\n5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year\u2014all while working from home\r\nLooking to make extra cash?

Even after that drop, the company's valuation remains several times higher than the multiples of legacy carmakers, with Ford Motor Co trading at about 8 times expected earnings and General Motors Co trading at under 6.\n\nGraphic: Tesla's forward PE remains far below previous levels - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/zgpobzwkyvd/Pasted%20image%201682006757952.png\n\nTesla on Wednesday doubled down on the price war it started at the end of last year, as Musk said the company would prioritize sales growth ahead of profit. In the first quarter, Tesla posted its lowest quarterly gross profit margin in two years.\n\n\"The market wants to see that Tesla management has a tangible plan to boost automotive gross margins and companywide operating profit margins over the coming quarters and in the next year or so,\" said Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein. \"I also think the market wants to see a growth plan that does not involve continuous price cuts.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nMusk brushed aside those fears on Wednesday, saying the company this year would likely achieve full self driving and that would be a big profit generator. Musk has missed his previous targets to achieve self-driving capability, dating back years.\n\nTesla now sells the FSD software, which does not make the vehicle autonomous, for $15,000. That is almost a third of the roughly $47,000 current starting price of the base Model Y in the United States.\n\n\"We're the only ones making cars that technically, we could sell for zero profit for now and then yield actually tremendous economics in the future through autonomy,\" he told analysts on a conference call on Wednesday. \"I'm not sure how many people will appreciate the profundity of what I've just said, but it is extremely significant.\"\n\nGOLD STANDARD\n\nSkeptics remain over how soon Tesla will launch FSD.\n\n\"This is a bit like the boy who cried wolf, except in our story the wolf would be a good thing that never seems to come,\" said Bryant Walker Smith, a law professor at the University of South Carolina who closely follows the development of advanced vehicle technologies.\n\n\"It's not clear to me how that timetable in any way is consistent with the evidence we have seen,\" he added, describing the current version of FSD as \"highly imperfect.\"\n\nOther key products expected from Tesla include the Cybertruck pickup later this year, as well as a lower-cost car that is expected in late 2024 or early 2025. Longer-term, Tesla believes robots could be a bigger profit generator than EVs.\n\nEvangelos Simoudis, a technology adviser, author and investor, believes Tesla may have \u201can even bigger opportunity\u201d in energy generation and storage with its solar panels and Powerwall battery systems.\n\nNot only is Tesla viewed as the gold standard in the auto sector, but many see it as more of a tech stock. Canaccord Genuity analyst George Gianarikas compared Tesla favorably to such tech stocks as Alphabet Inc, Meta Platforms Inc, Nvidia Corp, Apple Inc, Microsoft Corp and Amazon.com Inc.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the growth rates for Tesla versus those companies, Tesla is growing its revenue significantly more than their EBITDA, and so we feel like it's incredibly compelling relative to those companies because you're paying not only a lower PE but also you get better growth,\u201d said Gianarikas.\n\nUltimately, some industry observers feel investors are betting more on the man than the models.\n\n\"You're not investing in Tesla. You're investing in Elon Musk,\" said Kim Forrest, chief investment officer of Bokeh Capital Partners.\n\nFor true believers in Musk and Tesla, their faith will remain intact even if FSD is not launched this year, said Will Rhind, CEO of GraniteShares, an asset manager in New York that offers exchange-traded funds (ETFs) allowing investors to bet either long or short on Tesla stock.\n\n\"Potentially it never happens that the retail investor gives up the ghost,\" he said.\n\n(Reporting by Hyunjoo Jin in San Francisco and Akash Sriram in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Nivedita Balu in Bengaluru, Paul Lienert and Ben Klayman in Detroit and Noel Randewich in Oakland, California; Writing by Ben Klayman; Editing by Matthew Lewis)", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysis-elon-musk-pins-hopes-185327882.html", "symbols": ["TL0.F", "TL0.XETRA", "TSLA.MX", "TSLA.US", "TSLA34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.993, "neg": 0.038, "neu": 0.87, "pos": 0.091}}, {"date": "2023-04-20T18:33:21+00:00", "title": "GLOBAL MARKETS-Stocks dip as Tesla stumbles, US yields retreat after data", "content": "*\n\nTesla earnings weigh on stocks\n\n*\n\nBond yields retreat\n\n*\n\nUS initial jobless claims edge higher\n\n(Adds close of European markets, Fed comments)\n\nBy Chuck Mikolajczak\n\nNEW YORK, April 20 (Reuters) - A gauge of global stocks slipped for a second straight day on Thursday after a sharp decline in Tesla shares weighed while softening U.S. economic data and growing worries about the debt ceiling sent Treasury yields lower.\n\nOn Wall Street, shares of Tesla sank 10.28% after the electric vehicle maker missed gross margin forecasts and pledged further price cuts.\n\nThe drop put Tesla shares on track for their biggest daily percentage drop since Jan. 3 as the biggest drag on the S&P 500 index and pulled the S&P consumer discretionary sector down 1.46% as the worst performing of the 11 major S&P sectors.\n\nEconomic data showed weekly jobless claims rose last week, indicating the labor market may be starting to show signs of slowing as the lag effect of multiple interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve takes hold.\n\nIn addition, a gauge of manufacturing activity in the mid-Atlantic region plunged to its lowest level in three years in April while existing home sales fell in March and the Conference Board said its Leading Economic Index dropped 1.2% to its lowest since November 2020.\n\nAfter the data, Cleveland Federal Reserve President Loretta Mester said the central bank still has more interest rate hikes ahead of it, with the policy rate climbing over 5%.\n\nMester's comments come after Federal Reserve Bank of New York President John Williams said late on Wednesday the level of inflation remains problematic, and the central bank will act to lower it.\n\n\"The economic data is decelerating, the jobs market, which was the last really strong pillar there, is showing some signs of softness lately.

Ford said the demand for the Lightning is high there \u2014 and customers can sign up now to purchase special edition F-150 Lightning Lariat EVs.\n\nFord\u2019s move to sell the Lightning EV abroad is not a surprise. But picking Norway as a launch country was a little unexpected. To be sure, it is a country where 80% of new car sales are electric. But it is only home to only around 5.4 million people.\n\n\u201cThis is really a story about the customers, since we launched the vehicle, [the Norwegians] formed a Facebook group. It ended up with over 4,000 [potential] customers on there, and they demanded that we bring the vehicle to the region,\u201d Darren Palmer, VP of EV programs at Ford Model E, said in an interview with Yahoo Finance.\n\nAdded Ford Norway chief Per Gunnar Berg: \u201cI\u2019ve had customers literally banging on my door and pleading for us to bring the electric pickup to Norway.\u201d F-150 Lightning in Norway\n\nThe launch also comes only a couple weeks before Ford will announce its first-quarter earnings results \u2014 and for the first time report results across three new operating units: its EV business (Ford Model E), its traditional gas-powered car unit (Ford Blue), and Ford Pro commercial sales. Last month, Ford said its EV business unit is projected to lose $3 billion this year, but the company expects to hit its 8% EBIT margin objective by late 2026, \u201cwhich is tied to planned global electric vehicle production run rates of 600,000 units by the end of 2023, and two million by the end of 2026.\u201d\n\nFord, as it ramps up to double-production capacity of the Lightning to 150,000 vehicles per year at its plant in Dearborn, Michigan, must meet soaring customer demand both in the U.S. and now potentially foreign markets.\n\nThis demand has helped alleviate some of the pricing pressures felt by Ford since rival Tesla (TSLA)started cutting prices this year, Palmer said. Though the company did have to cut Mustang Mach-E prices, the company\u2019s EVs are \u201ccompletely sold out\u201d at the moment, and Palmer said the company is \u201cmonitoring the situation for dynamics for pricing, and we will adjust as the market sees fit and how our customers value our products.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nAs for its fans in Norway, the special edition Lightning will be offered in Super Crew Cab body styles only and in limited colors. Ford will sell the vehicle at Ford-authorized dealers that feature EV infrastructure and the capability to service F-150 Lightnings and other Ford EVs, like the upcoming European-only Ford Explorer EV.\n\nPricing hasn't been announced.\n\n\u2014\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Tesla\u2019s Model Y crossover was the sixth best-selling vehicle in the U.S. in 2022, but it might soon have internal competition from the company\u2019s Model 3, which now has a sticker price starting below $40,000.\n\nSee: 6 Richest People in the World You\u2019ve Never Heard Of\r\nFind: How To Build a Financial Plan From Zero\n\nThe Model 3 \u2014 a four-door sedan with rear-wheel drive \u2014 is already popular and is the least expensive model in Tesla\u2019s line. As reported by CNBC, it currently sits at 13th place in 2022 vehicle sales at 211,641 units, per Motor Intelligence data.\n\nCutting $2,000 off the Model 3, it has a base cost of $39,990, making it a relative \u201cbargain\u201d among EVs. This is true even though it is still more expensive than many hybrid plug-ins and 2023 EV models, like the Chevy Bolt EUV, the Mazda MX-30, the Hyundai Kona Electric and the Kia Nero EV, per Edmunds rankings.\n\nHowever, the Model 3 is now less than the average price of a new car, making it a more affordable option for consumers looking to switch over to an electric vehicle. Back in February, when the Model 3 was priced at $42,990, Bloomberg reported that it was selling for $4,930 less than the average new American vehicle.\n\nThis is the sixth time Tesla has cut prices on its electric vehicles this year and second time this month. As CNN reported, the decision to lower prices and ensuing lower short-term profits was necessary, according to CEO Elon Musk.\n\n\u201cWhile we reduced prices considerably in early Q1, it\u2019s worth noting that our operating margin remains among the best in the industry,\u201d Musk said. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken a view that pushing for higher volumes and a larger fleet is the right choice here versus a lower volume and higher margins.\u201d\n\nTake Our Poll: Would You Move for a Job That Paid You a $10,000 Signing Bonus?\n\nUnfortunately for existing and future Model 3 owners, the price cuts, which were announced prior to the company\u2019s first-quarter earnings report of April 19, coincide with the reductions in EV credits imposed by the U.S. Treasury which went into effect April 18. Credits for the Model 3 have been slashed to $3,750, but all other Tesla models will still be eligible for the full $7,500 credit as mandated by the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to Engadget, Tesla also cut the price on the consumer favorite Model Y. The base, Long Range and the Performance Model Y vehicles have been trimmed by $3,000 and now cost $46,990, $49,990 and $53,990, respectively.\n\nMore From GOBankingRates\n\n10 Aldi Brand Products Worth Buying Learn To Master Your Money With These Financial Tips How to Build a Financial Plan From Zero Financial Insight in Your Inbox: Sign Up for GBR's Daily Newsletter\n\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Is Tesla\u2019s $40K Electric Car Really a Bargain Now That the Price Has Been Slashed 6 Times?", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-40k-electric-car-really-171352604.html", "symbols": ["TL0.F", "TL0.XETRA", "TSLA.MX", "TSLA.US", "TSLA34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.987, "neg": 0.061, "neu": 0.824, "pos": 0.115}}, {"date": "2023-04-20T17:13:08+00:00", "title": "Tesla price war: Ford exec says company will adjust EV prices 'as the market sees fit'", "content": "Ford (F) is \"monitoring\" Tesla's (TSLA) price cuts, and will adjust its own EV prices \"as the market sees fit,\" says Darren Palmer, VP of Electric Vehicle Programs at Ford Model E Pricing.

Comments from Fed policymakers this week have also supported bets on further policy tightening.\n\nInvestors see an 88% chance of the Fed hiking rates by 25 basis points next month, according to CME Group's Fedwatch tool, but they have also priced in rate cuts by the end of the year.\n\nData showed the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits increased moderately last week, suggesting that the labor market was gradually slowing, while another set of numbers showed factory activity in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic region slumped more than expected in April.\n\n\"The momentum of the data is shifting toward weaker economic growth and the argument in favor of a Fed pause is increasing,\" David Russell, vice president of market intelligence at TradeStation.\n\nAdding to worries, the cost of insuring exposure to U.S. sovereign debt rose to the highest level since 2011 over market jitters that the government could hit its debt ceiling sooner than expected.\n\nAt 11:45 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 96.16 points, or 0.28%, at 33,800.85, the S&P 500 was down 18.73 points, or 0.45%, at 4,135.79, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 49.15 points, or 0.40%, at 12,108.07.\n\nIBM Corp gained 1.6% after the software company beat estimates for first-quarter profit.\n\nAmong regional banks, Zions Bancorp, Truist Financial Corp and KeyCorp dropped between 2.2% and 5.5% after their quarterly profits missed estimates.\n\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers by a 1.82-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 1.72-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\n\nThe S&P index recorded 21 new 52-week highs and three new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 39 new highs and 89 new lows.

but ended lower as Tesla led a slew of mostly disappointing quarter results just as economic data stoked further worries about a deeper slowdown.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3%, or 110 points, the S&P 500 fell 0.6%, and the Nasdaq fell 0.8%.\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) fell 10% after the electric vehicle maker reported earnings that missed Wall Street expectations as margins were dragged lower by a recent string of price cuts.\n\nThe concerns over margins intensified after the chief executive Elon Musk touted more cost cuts to boost sales, forcing some cautious commentary from Tesla bull Wedbush.\n\n\u201c[W]e remain very bullish on the Tesla story, however, this margin compression and price cut narrative must be carefully managed over the coming quarters as it now emerges as a clear overhang on the stock,\u201d Wedbush said in a note after cutting its price target on the stock to $200 from $225.\n\nTesla\u2019s willingness to sacrifice margins for long-term demand gain stoked fears of price war in the industry, pushing other automakers including General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) and Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) about 3% lower.\n\nIn tech, International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) ended flat after reporting mixed quarterly results and announcing that it had teamed with Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) to advance mRNA research.\n\nSemiconductor stocks traded roughly unchanged as investors weighed up a surge in Lam Research Corp (NASDAQ:LRCX) on better-than-expected Q3 results and a slump in Seagate Technology PLC (NASDAQ:STX) following a quarterly report that missed on both the top and bottom lines.\n\nAT&T Inc (NYSE:T), a major dow component, slumped more 10% amid concerns about the company\u2019s ability to meet its guidance and mixed quarterly results showing a revenue missed estimates.\n\n\u201cWhile we had anticipated lower FCF (free cash flow) to start the year, investors may question whether AT&T can achieve its full-year FCF guidance of $16bn+ as this will likely require significant improvements in working capital impacts for the remainder of 2023,\u201d Goldman Sachs said in a note.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut there were some positives on the earnings front as DR Horton Inc (NYSE:DHI) and Las Vegas Sands Corp (NYSE:LVS) reported quarterly results that beat on both the top and bottom lines, with the shares trading up more than 6% and 3.6% respectively.\n\nSentiment on risk assets including stocks was also soured by data showing further weakness in manufacturing and an uptick in jobless claims.\n\nThe Philadelphia Fed said Thursday its manufacturing index fell to a reading of -31.3 in April, from -23.2 in March.\n\nThe weaker data stoked worries about a deeper slowdown in the economy at a time when the Federal Reserve continues to lean toward further rate hikes.\n\n\u201cThe bigger risk now is that the Fed squeezes so hard that wage growth slows too far next year,\u201d Pantheon Macroeconomics said in a note.\n\nEchoing some of her Fed peers, Cleveland Federal Reserve President Loretta Mester said she expected that interest rates would \u201cneed to move somewhat further into restrictive territory this year,\u201d and remain higher to curb inflation.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nStock market today: Dow ends down on Tesla drag, economic jitters\n\nAfter-hours movers: ContextLogic gains on buyback, CSX up on EPS\n\nClorox

Smaller banks were reporting declines in deposits from the fourth quarter as customers looked for accounts with higher yields.\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) met expectations but its gross profit margin was squeezed by several price cuts this year, sending its shares down more than 10%. The price cuts are driving up demand, however. AT&T (NYSE:T) reported that subscriber growth had slowed, weighing on its stock, which also fell more than 10%.\n\nOn Friday, more data on services and manufacturing are due out, followed by reports next week on home prices and housing sales, a reading of first-quarter gross domestic product and personal consumption expenditures for March, a key inflation measure closely watched by the Federal Reserve.\n\nMixed earnings will also factor into the Fed\u2019s upcoming decision on interest rates at the start of May. Futures traders expect the central bank to raise rates another quarter of a percentage point and then pause the rate hikes after that.\n\nHere are three things that could affect markets tomorrow\n\n1.

They also cited a \"non-trivial risk\" of a technical default on Treasuries, joining analysts at Goldman Sachs and Citi in anticipating an earlier debt ceiling deadline.\n\nThe pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.14% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.22%. MSCI's index was on pace for its biggest one-day percentage decline since April 5.\n\nU.S. Treasury yields moved lower after the data, along with the concerns about Fed hike expectations and the rising debt ceiling worries.

However, Nio is an intriguing automaker that\u2019s boldly trying out battery-swapping stations even though Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) evidently has no interest in them. So, Nio\u2019s audacious strategy could result in multi-bagger returns with NIO stock.\n\nThe idea here isn\u2019t to let your entire account ride on Nio\u2019s future success. Maintaining a reasonable position size \u2014 say, $1,000 \u2014 is crucial as Nio has hero-or-zero potential amid a highly competitive EV market.\n\nThat said, it\u2019s worth betting $1,000 on Nio, because the company is willing to branch out and try new approaches. After all, Tesla\u2019s bold strategies are what made the automaker a winner during the past 20 years. So, prepare for a wild ride as Nio goes all-in on EV technologies that might or might not succeed but definitely shouldn\u2019t be ignored.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNio Seeks to Enhance the EV Charging Experience\n\nWe\u2019ll talk about battery swapping technology in a moment, but there\u2019s another interesting development with Nio that should be addressed. Specifically, Nio announced a partnership with energy technology company Tibber.\n\nThis collaboration could greatly enhance the EV charging experience for Nio\u2019s customers. Tibber, a Norwegian company, provides an energy usage tracking app that will be more familiar to European drivers than American ones.\n\nWith the Tibber app, Nio\u2019s drivers can easily keep track of their energy usage. Plus, they can find energy prices in real time. Additionally, Tibber\u2019s \u201cSmart Charging\u201d feature can help drivers take control of the charging of their EVs, with the goal of powering up at the lowest possible energy prices. It\u2019s a brilliant concept that will hopefully gain traction, not only in Europe but in America and elsewhere.\n\nStory continues\n\nBattery Swapping Stations Could Catalyze NIO Stock\n\nYet, an enhanced EV charging experience isn\u2019t the only bright idea that Nio is road-testing. The automaker is also venturing into an EV concept that Tesla seemingly rejected but probably shouldn\u2019t.\n\nReportedly, a spokesperson with Tesla stated, \u201cthe company believes electric vehicle charging is the best way to power its vehicles.\u201d Furthermore, the spokesperson said Tesla believes \u201cthat battery swapping is riddled with problems and not suitable for widescale use.\u201d\n\nTesla\u2019s management may come to regret that stance someday. Compared to conventional EV charging, battery swapping could offer greater speed, convenience and possible cost savings.\n\nUnlike Tesla, Nio is going all-in on battery swapping technology. Nio asserted unequivocally that it \u201cwill speed up the expansion of the battery swapping network\u201d this year. Moreover, Nio already commenced a \u201ctrial operation\u201d of \u201cfaster, more efficient battery swapping stations in China.\u201d\n\nGo Ahead and Bet $1,000 on NIO Stock\n\nIf Nio continues to pursue an ambitious strategy with battery swapping stations, the automaker may actually threaten Tesla\u2019s dominance in the EV market. Also, Nio\u2019s collaboration with Tibber is a savvy move that should increase customer satisfaction and loyalty.\n\nNio might succeed in these endeavors, or it might not. Still, it will certainly be exciting to see how the company\u2019s bold ventures pan out. Thus, investors should consider taking a reasonably sized $1,000 position NIO stock. You could end up taking a loss, but 2x, 3x or greater returns are entirely possible during the coming years.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Osborne remains skeptical about when that technology will be available.\n\n\u201cWe continue to question whether FSD will ever work on a camera-only based system\u201d with older hardware, Osborne wrote.\n\nTesla made $2.51 billion from January through March, down from $3.32 billion a year ago. Revenue rose 24% to $23.33 billion, but the company\u2019s operating profit margin fell.\n\nCEO Elon Musk hinted that price cuts may not be over. He told analysts that Tesla evaluates them daily and wants to keep producing the maximum number of vehicles possible.\n\n\u201cOrders are in excess of production,\u201d he said when asked what happened to orders since recent price cuts were announced.\n\nEarly in the quarter Tesla reduced U.S. prices on many of its models, then did it a second time early in March. The company slashed U.S. prices two more times in April, including overnight Wednesday, in an effort to boost sales. It trimmed prices in Europe as well.\n\nThe company produced nearly 18,000 more vehicles than it sold during the quarter, indicating softening demand.\n\nTesla\u2019s first-quarter operating margin fell from 19.2% in the first quarter of last year to 11.4% this quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nMusk said Tesla wants to sell more vehicles at lower prices so it later can take in revenue from its $15,000 \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d system that will turn cars into robotaxis and increase their value.\n\nDespite the name, the cars cannot drive themselves, and Tesla warns drivers that they have to be ready to intervene at all times.\n\nIn 2019, Musk promised a fleet of autonomous robotaxis by 2020, and he said early last year that the cars would be autonomous in 2022. Since 2021, Tesla has been using owners to beta test \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d on public roads.\n\nBut Tesla\u2019s partially automated driving systems are coming under increasing scrutiny from U.S. safety regulators. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has sent investigative teams to more than 30 crashes since 2016 in which Teslas suspected of operating on Autopilot or \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d have struck pedestrians, motorcyclists, semi trailers and parked emergency vehicles. At least 14 people were killed in the crashes.\n\nIn addition, NHTSA in February pressured Tesla into recalling nearly 363,000 vehicles with \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d software because the system can break traffic laws. The agency said in documents that the system can make unsafe actions such as traveling straight through an intersection from a turn-only lane or going through a yellow traffic light without proper caution. The problems were to be fixed with an online software update.\n\nThe Justice Department also has asked Tesla for documents about \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d and Autopilot.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/teslas-price-cuts-drag-share-134428930.html", "symbols": ["TL0.F", "TL0.XETRA", "TSLA.MX", "TSLA.US", "TSLA34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.85, "neg": 0.076, "neu": 0.838, "pos": 0.086}}, {"date": "2023-04-20T13:44:17+00:00", "title": "Tesla Earnings Slide As Profit Margins Drop Below 'Floor'; Here's What Analysts Had To Say", "content": "Tesla sank on the first-quarter earnings report as profit margins plunged below a 20% \"floor\" due to big price cuts.\n\nContinue reading", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/m/f6713717-d1ee-337f-9765-4ab49993c708/tesla-earnings-slide-as.html", "symbols": ["TL0.F", "TL0.XETRA", "TSLA.MX", "TSLA.US", "TSLA34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.178, "neg": 0.091, "neu": 0.788, "pos": 0.12}}, {"date": "2023-04-20T13:42:00+00:00", "title": "Tesla Stock Tumbles As Elon Musk Stresses Sales Growth Over Profits After Q1 Earnings", "content": "\"We're taking a view that pushing for higher volumes and a larger fleet is the right choice here versus a lower volume and higher margin,\" said CEO Elon Musk.\n\nContinue reading", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/m/a99a363b-2aa0-3388-a332-3f8e58ec0166/tesla-stock-tumbles-as-elon.html", "symbols": ["TL0.F", "TL0.XETRA", "TSLA.MX", "TSLA.US", "TSLA34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": -0.296, "neg": 0.075, "neu": 0.925, "pos": 0}}, {"date": "2023-04-20T13:39:45+00:00", "title": "Tesla\u2019s earnings report \u2018really wasn\u2019t a big surprise,\u2019 analyst says", "content": "ROTH Capital Partners Senior Research Analyst Craig Irwin and RBC Capital Markets Analyst Tom Narayan join Yahoo Finance Live to discuss Tesla earnings, the EV maker\u2019s sixth round of price cuts, the demand for EVs, and the outlook for the EV industry.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n- As investors digest Tesla's latest earnings report, Wall Street remains at odds over how you should play the stock in your portfolio. Let's bring in Tom Narayan, who is RBC Analyst who's bullish on Tesla stock with an outperform rating. We've also got ROTH Capital Partners Senior Research Analyst Craig Irwin, who has a neutral rating and an $85 price target. Craig, I want to begin with you. What did you make of the tone, the tenor that was set from Tesla during last night's call?\n\nCRAIG IRWIN: You know, it really wasn't a big surprise for us. We've been consistent for a long time saying that 100 new EVs on the market in 2023. EV models from competing producers is going to be significant pressure. So there was a correction in the back end of last year, when they hit a demand air pocket and when, obviously, the consumer got a little bit weak for them. You know, Wall Street got a little too bullish. And, you know, it's a growth stock, so they know they have to keep that growth rate up, you know.\n\n36% deliveries growth is not all that impressive when they're guiding for 50. And really, it was only 18 on the top line, net income declined by 23%. I'm looking at this and I'm saying, you know, the 230 basis point miss on margins is not a huge surprise, and things are going to get worse. It's a great company, great products, love the fact that they pioneered this market, but there's a lot of other companies that are going to be successful here too, and the valuation is egregious.\n\nJust the move today, 9% more or less is about the entire size of Ford's market cap, to put it in perspective. So egregiously overvalued, not unexpected, and quite bearish for the equity. But sector, I think the sector is going to do very well for the long run.\n\nStory continues\n\n- Tom, let's get you in here because you did lower your price target, but you're still at 212. You're still at an outperform for the stock. So clearly, you don't think it is egregiously overvalued here. Do you though see deteriorating demand for Tesla vehicles?\n\nTOM NARAYAN: I think that's ultimately what everybody wants to know, right? It's easy to get kind of caught up in a specific earnings quarter and kind of lose sight of the bigger picture. And I think what happens here is, you know, is there underlying demand problems at Tesla? I don't think this is enough evidence to suggest that, and the reason is, look at the overall auto industry. This is the biggest fear right now happening, is that pricing has to come down. From 2016 to 2019, pricing was up 9%.\n\nFrom 2019 to 2022, it's up 37%, right? So I think Tesla is just being the first one out the gates to cut pricing. Remember, pricing went up a lot in 2022. Others are going to follow. The other thing is they're targeting the ICE market, not just EVs. They made that very clear on the earnings call yesterday. And it's a volume story and a growth story, as you pointed out, right? Name any other automaker going from 1.2 million to 1.8 million units this year. Huge growth. You have new products, Cybertruck, the potential for the model 2.\n\nYou know, ultimately, it's not really-- I don't think it's really a Tesla demand issue. It's just an auto demand issue, with affordability potentially being an issue. I don't know what anybody else making EVs as profitable as they are. You pointed out Ford, you know. What did they just announced, what their EV margins are, they're very much dilutive. So Tesla has the ability to cut pricing. And I actually think that other automakers are inevitably going to have to follow suit.\n\n- Tom, I want to stay with you for a second. What pricing, do you believe, that the Cybertruck is going to need to come in at in order to hit some of your own targets that you have for the stock, for the company as well?\n\nTOM NARAYAN: Yeah. I mean, I think that's going to come out a pretty strong pricing. There are rumors that it could actually come out being actually not that high. I think it has the ability to come out in the 50,000 to 60,000, maybe even higher range. But it may actually come out at that 50 level, maybe even below it. It's unclear, but, you know, ultimately, this is a segment that they're completely not in. And in the US, it's a ginormous market opportunity for them.\n\nWe've heard reports of what orders are potentially for the Cybertruck, and we understand how they're making this. It's completely different than how they make any other vehicle that they have. So it has a cost advantage as well. So it's unclear on cost, but I think it could come in actually below what a lot of folks think, and I don't think it needs to be all that high. Again, you pointed out early on this is really a play for them to get the fleet as big as possible so they can sell other products, FSD, autopilot, et cetera.\n\nSo at the end of the day, the subscription revenues you collect from that come at massive margins, because it's R&D that you can scale out, and then you can offset price cuts really easily. So that whole autonomy point with greater volumes, I do think that's been missed on the market. And Elon said it a couple of times, that it's probably the most profound thing he said on that call.\n\nAnd I do think that there's a very good chance that in the future, maybe not tomorrow, this will wind up being the biggest takeaway from this call, their ability to monetize on autonomy.\n\n- I want to dig more into autonomy in a bit. But first, I want to linger on the Cybertruck for a moment, Craig, and get your take. Because I look at that thing, which is now years late. It looks like something out of Mad Max. I don't know who's-- like what is the real market for this thing when it actually hits the market, if it hits the market? Like, is it going to be a bust or is it going to be this huge thing?\n\nCRAIG IRWIN: Let's get real, right? Let's get real. The only way they're going to have a sub-$50,000 Cybertruck is a two-wheel drive truck. How many trucks sold in America are two-wheel drives? You know, it's just not going to happen. The pricing of this thing is probably going to end up being, you know, 70, 80, $90,000 for the four wheel drive version. You know, I have a very hard time seeing that being a compelling product in the market.\n\nYou know, the reservations numbers they've shared with us are based on a $100 deposit, which is almost like a joke. And it's not based on thousands of dollars in deposits, where you've really got skin in the game. You know, I'm skeptical. I'm not a big believer in the Cybertruck. You know, I love their really willingness to step out and do something innovative, but if that's what people want to hang their hat on, so be it. I just, you know-- don't think you'd sell a lot of two-wheel drive trucks in America.\n\n- Craig I'm reluctant to call shapes innovative. It's a Pentagon on wheels. Let's be real.\n\n[LAUGHTER]\n\nCRAIG IRWIN: With unbreakable glass, right?\n\n- Depending upon which you throw.\n\n[LAUGHTER]\n\nCRAIG IRWIN: Honestly, I'm skeptical. I'm skeptical about the Cybertruck. This mini car is-- it was supposed to be launched in '19. The reason they didn't launch it in '19 is the margins would have been massively dilutive. That's why we saw this dog and pony show at the most recent analyst day, where they're talking about modular manufacturing that's not unique. All OEMs have looked at that. Many of them have adopted it for sub components already. You know, not unique to Tesla. It's not unique to Tesla.\n\nThe mini car is going to be margin dilutive. That is going to be much more serious than the price issues that they're working through right now. You know, I think we have a troublesome period for the equity for the next few years. And, you know, realistically, EVs are inevitable. There's going to be a lot of companies that are successful. There's going to be a lot of companies in the supply chain either on the battery side or the component side that are going to be successful.\n\nI just don't think Tesla is the one to invest in here. I think there are other great names and that we need to acknowledge Tesla is a pioneer that got this market started and the impeccable execution on great products, but the equity I think is troubled.\n\n- Hey, Tom, I also want to just pivot back to something that is going to be amazingly important for them, is the free cash flow. And they took a free cash flow hit in this most recent quarter. Is this company going to run into a free cash flow problem in order just to ramp up to the type of customer base that they want to build out to?\n\nTOM NARAYAN: Yeah. I mean, this is something we're noticing across the auto industry for Q1, right? So it's likely a working capital issue. A lot of companies are reporting negative free cash flow for Q1. Again, it's very difficult to just extrapolate so much after one quarter. This is a company that is profitable in selling, in EV product, where the entire industry is migrating towards a ton of growth. Again, its pricing is coming down to where ICE level pricing is, and they're still profitable.\n\nSo I don't really see why there's a cash burn issue. There are pure play EV players out there that have real cash issues that are generating negative cash for protracted several years. This is not one of them. Plus they have this a pretty significant market capitalization, ability to finance growth, if they need to through other means. I just think like folks are getting a little too caught up maybe in one earnings. We need to really see what happens. I know next quarter, it's probably going to be challenged as well from a margin perspective.\n\nBut he said it flat out on the earnings call, that once we see evidence of macroeconomic slowdown reversing, they'll raise pricing again, and we saw that last year. There were prices going up, there were prices going down. So there could be quick adjustments to pricing when needed.\n\n- Yeah, although free cash flow has been a perennial issue to be fair for Tesla. It's not just a one quarter issue. It's come up through the years, occasionally. I do want to circle back though to autonomy real quick, Tom, and dig into that just a little bit, because this, to me, falls in the category of promises from Elon Musk. Yes, full self-driving exists, but it's not full self-driving, right? You know, so I just wonder it's one of these things that, in theory, sure, is a huge opportunity. I just wonder where the theory meets the reality.\n\nTOM NARAYAN: Yeah. I mean, I think there's a lot of these words that get kind of lost in the reality. Yeah, you're right. It's probably not the best marketing, right, approach, to call something maybe what it's not. But at the end of the day, people are willing to pay for a product if--\n\n- He should bring back his marketing team, Tom.\n\n[LAUGHTER]\n\nTOM NARAYAN: If you want to call it L2 plus, right, or whatever, maybe that's not full self-driving, it's still an amazing product. I don't know if you guys ever tested out a Tesla with the L2 plus features, it's pretty amazing what this can do, right? And folks are willing to pay more now the tax rate has come down, right, since they initially it came out. But what happens now, remember, they're getting that $7,500 credit. A lot of other car makers in the US are not.\n\nWhat happens if Uncle Sam is paying for that and this consumer gets Tesla now for a lot less? Maybe they spend that extra cash on some of these services that can't come at huge margins, totally can offset these price cutting. And by the way, this price cutting is going to happen throughout the whole industry. Tesla's just more rational in starting it first. They're better able to capitalize on these subscription revenues, and I think others probably aren't as much.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/video/tesla-earnings-report-really-wasn-133945917.html", "symbols": ["TL0.F", "TL0.XETRA", "TSLA.MX", "TSLA.US", "TSLA34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 1, "neg": 0.05, "neu": 0.832, "pos": 0.118}}, {"date": "2023-04-20T13:34:00+00:00", "title": "How Are Tesla's Disappointing Results Affecting the Charts?", "content": "Shares of EV maker Tesla were trading significantly lower in early market activity Thursday.

According to estimates from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the French economy was worth a whopping $2.9 trillion as of April 2023. France is also a former colonial power and ruled over significant portions of Africa for most of the continent's history over the past century. It is one of the most historic countries in the world, known for its empires and dynasties \u2013 and their downfall as well. The French military dictator Napoleon is widely revered as one of the greatest military commanders in human history, yet the revolutionaries that overthrew the French monarchy that led to Napoleon's take over of power are also equally remembered.\n\nIn modern day times, France played an inconsequential role in the second world war, as it was occupied by Nazi Germany during the war's early days. The German invasion lasted for five years and France was the center of fighting during the war as the Allies fought to liberate the country from the Germans. However, while Japan is highly praised for its economic growth after the war ended, equally impressive are France's achievements - especially since it is one of the biggest military powers in the world and one of the few countries that previously controlled a full spectrum of nuclear delivery options, commonly known as the nuclear triad and comprising of land, sea, and air based nuclear delivery systems.\n\nIn fact, it can very well be argued that after the U.S., France has the strongest privatized defense industries. The French firm ArianeGroup is one of two private companies in the world that has an operational submarine launched nuclear ballistic missile dubbed the M51. The M51 is capable of reaching its target at least 10,000 kilometers away, making it the second longest range missile of its kind, surpassed only by the American Trident. Trident has a range of 12,000 kilometers and is made by the space division of Lockheed Martin. These systems have stood the test of time, as even China does not possess these lethal weapons.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, France's defense dominance isn't limited to the M51. The French firm Dassault Aviation Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 anonyme (EPA:AM.PA) is one of the world's leading fighter jet manufacturers and stands shoulder to shoulder with Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT). As is the case with the M51, Dassault, one of the largest French companies, is also only one of two private companies that has an operational fifth generation fighter aircraft. The other, unsurprisingly, is Lockheed. Dassault's fifth generation Rafale jet is also one of the most widely sought aircraft in the world, particularly since the American counterpart, the F-22 Raptor, cannot be exported under U.S. law due to its significant air superiority advantages.\n\nYet, missiles and planes are not the only two things that France is known for. Some of the biggest French companies, with operations all over the world are in the fashion industry. Companies such as LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy - Louis Vuitton, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne (EPA:MC.PA), Herm\u00e8s International Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 en commandite par actions (EPA:RMS.PA), and Christian Dior SE (EPA:CDI.PA) are some of the biggest fashion brands in the world with a market capitalization in hundreds of billions of dollars. At the same time, these companies rake in billions of dollars in revenue as well, with Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior being the largest and having brought in 79 billion Euros in revenue during 2022. Their success has also made their owner, Bernard Arnault and Family, the richest in the world as of April 2023. According to Forbes Magazine, Mr. Arnault is worth a whopping $238 billion, beating the Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) owner Mr. Elon Musk by more than $50 billion.\n\nFinally, France has also won accolades for itself in the astronautics industry. Arianespace SA is the world's oldest commercial rocket company, having been set up in 1980. And before Space Exploration Technologies Corporation (SpaceX) took over the launch services market, the firm was also the largest launch provider in the world.

The French government argues that pensions contribute to the country's massive national debt, one of the highest in Europe, and the number of pensions will grow to unsustainable levels soon if reform is not undertaken. However, criticisms of the reform include the fact that it does not help women, discriminates against lower wage earners, and has come during a time of a cost of living crisis. For the economy, the Bank of France had some good news in April 2023 as it pointed out that the economy will grow by 0.2% during the first quarter of this year as opposed to the 0.1% growth outlined by earlier projections. This uptick comes as supply chain pressures on the construction and industrial sector ease and raw material prices continue to be stable except for a few sectors. However, the labor market is still tight and a lot of companies are still facing trouble when finding workers.\n\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at some of the largest French companies that operate in America.

It\u2019s expanding in China and internationally, and its goal is to have 2,300 battery-swapping stations up and running by the end of the year.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt\u2019s also dipping its toes into other ventures, such as a\u00a0five-year partnership with Wencan Group, a supplier of one-piece die-casting parts, and a collaboration with energy technology company Tibber, which provides an energy usage tracking app.\n\nBut all in all, Nio\u2019s been an enormous disappointment.

Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhen you think about underperforming stocks to get rid of, one of the first names that should cross your mind is\u00a0Silvergate Capital (NYSE:SI). The crypto bank looks to be seeing its final days, as it announced in March that it\u2019s shutting down operations and liquidating.\n\nWhile it\u2019s at least a relief that Silvergate can refund all of its depositors, it\u2019s never good news when a bank fails, even when it\u2019s a crypto bank. But cryptocurrencies are more volatile and riskier than traditional banks, so let this be a lesson to would-be investors of similar ventures.\n\nAlso, here\u2019s a word of caution. There\u2019s already been some talk of speculators trying to take advantage of a short squeeze and run of the stock price. Save yourself the trouble and avoid the temptation.\n\nSI stock has a well-deserved \u201cF\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nRivian Automotive (RIVN) A new Rivian R1T truck is seen at a Rivian service center in South San Francisco, California.

RIVN stock price predictions\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother electric vehicle company that looked to go head-to-head with Tesla,\u00a0Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ:RIVN) is headed in the wrong direction. The stock price is down 66% in the last year and 30% in 2023.\n\nPart of the problem is what UBS analyst Patrick Hummel calls an\u00a0automotive glut that threatens automakers in the U.S. Automakers are increasing production but demand for vehicles is decidedly cooler.\n\nIt will stay that way as interest rates are elevated and people are less inclined to finance a new purchase.\n\nRivian also struggles to get vehicles off the production lines and out the door. The company is guiding to produce 50,000 vehicles this year, but the first quarter could only churn out 9,395. It needs to pick up the pace.\n\nAnd don\u2019t forget that Rivian is still burning cash. It\u2019s guiding for losses in 2023 to continue, similar to 2022 when Rivian lost $5.2 billion.\n\nRIVN stock has a \u201cD\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nCanopy Growth Corporation (CGC) CGC stock: worker in flannel shirt planting young marijuana plant, symbolizing marijuana stocks and Cronos (CRON)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nTwo years ago,\u00a0Canopy Growth Corporation (NASDAQ:CGC) and other marijuana stocks were belles of the ball.\n\nThere was widespread speculation that CGC stock would see a big payday as Democrats seized control of both houses of Congress and the White House. Federal legalization of marijuana seemed inevitable.\n\nBut as we established, nothing is inevitable in investing.\n\nInstead of marijuana laws, the White House has focused more on heading off inflation and infrastructure improvements. Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine roiled the globe and had Congress dealing with sanctions against Moscow and relief packages for Kyiv.\n\nFollowing the midterm elections, control of Congress is split, and there\u2019s no appetite for taking up marijuana laws before the next presidential election. The window for Canopy Growth and other marijuana companies has closed, at least for now.\n\nCanopy stock is down 75% in the last year and has a \u201cD\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nTattooed Chef (TTCF) Information about a Tattooed Chef acai bowl is shown on a phone.\n\nSource: Spyro the Dragon / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother trend that seems to have peaked in the last couple of years is plant-based food. While there\u2019s no denying the health benefits of such a diet, and plant-based foods went mainstream over the previous decade. Interest has waned.\n\nIt\u2019s fallen to where\u00a0Tattooed Chef (NASDAQ:TTCF), which built its entire business model on creating products for a plant-based diet, has openly contemplated adding real meat to its offerings.\n\nI\u2019m sure some are aghast at the idea such a decision would completely change the company\u2019s foundation. But as a potential investor, I appreciate any company willing to explore all its options to bring returns to its customers.\n\nDoes that make TTCF stock a good investment now? Absolutely not. Don\u2019t confuse sentiment for cold reality.\n\nThe reality for TTCF is that this is not a good time to invest. It\u2019s underperforming, and there\u2019s no sign that Tattooed Chef will turn things around.\n\nTTCF stock is down 83% over the last year, and in April received a\u00a0non-compliance letter for failing to file its annual report for the 2022 fiscal year. That makes it one of the more dangerous underperforming stocks to hold.\n\nThe company\u2019s most recent earnings report was for the third quarter of 2022, filed in mid-November. It showed the company posted revenue of $54.1 million and an earnings-per-share loss of 43 cents, much worse than analysts\u2019 expectations for $72.8 million in revenue and an EPS loss of 19 cents.\n\nTTCF stock has an \u201cF\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nChargePoint Holdings (CHPT) EV stocks: A close-up shot of a ChargePoint charging station.\n\nSource: YuniqueB / Shutterstock.com\n\nHere\u2019s another company that probably baffled investors. ChargePoint Holdings (NYSE:CHPT) has a network of electric vehicle charging stations stretching across 14 countries.\n\nWith EVs seemingly on the rise and efforts such as in the U.S. to build a network of EV charging stations to support the technology, investors probably thought CHPT stock would be a big winner. But that hasn\u2019t happened.\n\nChargePoint stock is down by 40% over the last year, making it one of the underperforming stocks to sell while you can. Just as troubling, Goldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney said ChargePoint has a limited margin for improvement by competition and an industry mix toward DC fast charging stations.\n\nDelaney has a $10 price target on CHPT stock, close to where it trades today.\n\nCHPT stock has a \u201cC\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nFisker (FSR) The Fisker logo hangs on display at the November 2011 International Auto Show.\n\nSource: Eric Broder Van Dyke / Shutterstock.com\n\nFisker (NYSE:FSR) is another EV car company that was born hoping to take a bite out of the Tesla market share. Its vehicles are highly regarded. The debut model, the Fisker Ocean, won the 2023 Red Dot product design award for best EV of the year.\n\nBut the company will need help making money on its vehicles. A primary supplier, Magna International, has significant supply chain problems that will increase the cost of production.\n\nStill, Fisker can\u2019t pass those costs on to customers who\u2019ve already reserved their vehicles. It will just have to eat it.\n\nFisker plans to deliver 5,000 of the Fisker Oceans by September, but it\u2019s still awaiting approval from\u00a0U.S. environmental regulators before moving forward.\n\nIn another lifetime, Fisker may have had a real chance against Tesla. But it\u2019s too far behind in the EV race to be a serious player.

More earnings are due, while crude slumps on fears of a U.S. economic slowdown.\n\n1. Tesla puts sales growth ahead of profit\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) reported its first-quarter earnings after the close Wednesday, and the electric vehicle manufacturer missed Wall Street estimates, posting its lowest quarterly gross margin in two years, hurt by price cuts.\n\nCEO Elon Musk made it clear in the accompanying conference call that the price war he started at the end of last year would continue, as the company prioritizes sales growth ahead of profit in a weak economy.\n\n\"It's better to shift a large number of cars at lower margin and harvest that margin in the future as we perfect autonomy,\" Musk said.\n\nThe company reported a total gross margin of 19.3%, short of market expectations of 22.4%, and maintained its official target of 1.8 million deliveries this year.\n\nTesla has cut prices worldwide on its EVs, including in the U.S. where it recently announced price reductions for the sixth time this year. And the cuts have been dramatic, with the base price of Model 3 falling below $40,000 in the U.S. for the first time in years, a drop of around $7,000 from the start of the year.\n\nTesla stock slumped over 7% in premarket trading.\n\n2. Earnings continue to flood in\n\nThe earnings deluge continues Thursday, with just over a tenth of companies in the S&P 500 having reported earnings as of Wednesday evening.\n\nTelecom giant AT&T (NYSE:T), financial services firm American Express (NYSE:AXP), carrier Alaska Air (NYSE:ALK) and private investment firm Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) are among the companies scheduled to release results Thursday.\n\nAdditionally, IBM (NYSE:IBM) stock rose 2% premarket after Big Blue beat expectations for first-quarter profit after the close Wednesday and signaled demand for IT services was better than feared.\n\nStory continues\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) reported a slightly stronger-than-expected net income in the first quarter as some resilience in global chip demand helped fuel stronger sales, while Nokia (NYSE:NOK) reported operating profit below forecasts for the first quarter and the telecom equipment maker said it was seeing signs of customer spending slowing down.\n\n3. Futures lower; slowdown concerns to the fore\n\nU.S. futures traded sharply lower Thursday, as investors digest a series of corporate earnings ahead of the release of more important economic data amid fears of a slowdown.\n\nAt 05:05 ET (09:05 GMT), the Dow futures contract dropped 165 points or 0.5%, S&P 500 futures fell 32 points or 0.8%, and Nasdaq 100 futures retreated 155 points or 1.2%.\n\nEarnings reports have been mixed so far, however, it\u2019s clear that results from the S&P 500-listed companies are going to be weaker than the year-ago period. This plays into the narrative that the U.S. economy could fall into recession later in the year.\n\nThere is more economic data to study Thursday in the form of jobless claims and existing home sales, while Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic and Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester are among central bank speakers slated to comment on the state of the U.S. economy.\n\n4. HSBC tries to head off break-up talk\n\nHSBC\u2019s (LON:HSBA) (NYSE:HSBC) management team is under pressure to justify its business model, after a major shareholder renewed its call for a break up of the Asia-focused bank earlier in the week.\n\nPing An Asset Management Company said in a statement HSBC has \"drained\" its Asia unit of dividends and growth capital to support its relatively low-return non-Asian businesses.\n\nThe biggest shareholder is seen as likely to vote in favor of splitting the bank up at its annual investor meeting in early May 5.\n\nHSBC responded late Wednesday, saying, in a note, that spinning off the Asian business \u201cwould result in material loss of value for HSBC shareholders.\u201d\n\nWith an around 8% stake in HSBC, Ping An would not be able to force the issue on its own, and the lender did report a sharp jump in its fourth-quarter profit last month after years of transformation and cost-cutting.\n\nThat said, it\u2019s clear that the management of one of Europe\u2019s largest banks is under notice that continued success is required.\n\n5. Oil prices fall to lowest since OPEC+\n\nCrude prices slumped Thursday, extending recent losses on concerns a stalling U.S. economy will hit crude demand from the world\u2019s largest consumer of energy.\n\nBy 05:10 ET, U.S. crude futures were down 1.9% at $77.77 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 1.7% to $81.68 per barrel.\n\nBoth benchmarks fell around 2% on Wednesday, and are now at their lowest since OPEC+ announced its surprise production cut on April 2.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s Beige Book, a periodic look at conditions in its regional districts, suggested that the U.S. economy stalled in recent weeks, with hiring and inflation slowing and access to credit narrowing, adding to concerns that the economy is slipping into recession.\n\nThese fears outweighed the news that U.S. crude stockpiles fell by 4.6 million barrels last week, according to data released Wednesday by the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nTesla earnings, HSBC break up, jobless claims - what's moving markets\n\nAmEx profit takes a hit from reserve buildup as slowdown worries rise\n\nBlackstone's first-quarter earnings plunge on real estate slowdown", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-earnings-hsbc-break-jobless-052432296.html", "symbols": ["0005.HK", "ALK.US", "AXP.US", "BX.US", "GSPC.INDX", "HBC1.F", "HBC1.XETRA", "HBC2.F", "HBCYF.US", "HSBA.LSE", "HSBC.US", "IBM.US", "NOK.US", "T.US", "TSLA.US", "TSM.US"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": -0.973, "neg": 0.106, "neu": 0.815, "pos": 0.079}}, {"date": "2023-04-20T05:16:42+00:00", "title": "GLOBAL MARKETS-Asian shares, dollar wobble on caution before central bank meetings", "content": "By Ankur Banerjee\n\nSINGAPORE, April 20 (Reuters) - Asian stocks inched lower on Thursday, while the dollar clung to overnight gains in cautious trading as U.S. Federal Reserve policymakers reiterated their commitment to reining in inflation despite signs of mounting economic headwinds.\n\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was 0.16% lower, set for third straight day of losses.

The move marks an escalation in Tesla\u2019s bitter price war to capture market share from legacy automobile makers in the U.S., while also looking to expand its footprint in China, its biggest market.\n\nTesla\u2019s discount spree started with China, as it sought to compete with much cheaper and more competitive offerings from local peers. But this invited similar price cuts from Chinese EV makers, which analysts warn could dent industry profitability.\n\nXPeng founder He Xiaopeng warned that increased competition could result in the weeding out of some local players. Analysts also cautioned that Tesla will likely have to cut prices further in order to appear more competitive.\n\nTesla\u2019s Chinese competitors also unveiled a slew of less expensive models this week, with plans to capture export markets in Asia, the U.S., and Europe. Warren Buffett-backed BYD, China\u2019s largest EV maker, unveiled a budget 'Seagull' model at the Shanghai auto show, with a retail price of about $11,000 - a fraction of the prices charged by other manufacturers.\n\nStory continues\n\nData this week showed China\u2019s EV sales rose about 30% so far this year, also boosted by pent-up demand after the country relaxed most anti-COVID measures at the beginning of 2023.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nChinese EV stocks sink tracking Tesla as price war heats up\n\nBMW skids into ice cream melee at Shanghai auto show\n\nInvestors warn big consumer firms over price hikes as competitors gain", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chinese-ev-stocks-sink-tracking-011848736.html", "symbols": ["1211.HK", "2015.HK", "9866.HK", "9868.HK", "LI.US", "NIO.US", "TL0.F", "TL0.XETRA", "TSLA.MX", "TSLA.US", "TSLA34.SA", "XPEV.US"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": -0.906, "neg": 0.119, "neu": 0.798, "pos": 0.084}}, {"date": "2023-04-20T00:27:04+00:00", "title": "Tesla Earnings Drop 21% Driven By Price Cuts: 7 Metrics You Should See", "content": "Tesla stock is down 6% in after-hours trading on Wednesday, as investors are likely unnerved that the Q1 auto gross margin dropped substantially.\n\nContinue reading", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/m/ac17bdeb-038f-332c-a281-c15ef703d44c/tesla-earnings-drop-21%25.html", "symbols": ["TL0.F", "TL0.XETRA", "TSLA.MX", "TSLA.US", "TSLA34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": -0.477, "neg": 0.114, "neu": 0.886, "pos": 0}}, {"date": "2023-04-20T00:20:00+00:00", "title": "Tesla Counts the Cost of Its Price War", "content": "The electric-vehicle maker hopes to recoup some of its lost margin by selling automated-driving features, but first it has to make them work.\n\nContinue reading", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/m/013afabb-d6b5-38c4-9cde-1c27384b3e3c/tesla-counts-the-cost-of-its.html", "symbols": ["TL0.F", "TL0.XETRA", "TSLA.MX", "TSLA.US", "TSLA34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.064, "neg": 0.062, "neu": 0.866, "pos": 0.072}}, {"date": "2023-04-19T23:58:55+00:00", "title": "Elon Musk signals willingness to sacrifice Tesla margins for market share", "content": "Electric-car maker\u2019s chief says it will \u2018invest in growth as fast as possible\u2019 after slashing prices to boost demand\n\nContinue reading", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/m/2bd10d9a-c70c-3250-a286-1d157086ec3a/elon-musk-signals-willingness.html", "symbols": ["TL0.F", "TL0.XETRA", "TSLA.MX", "TSLA.US", "TSLA34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.402, "neg": 0.139, "neu": 0.656, "pos": 0.205}}, {"date": "2023-04-19T23:58:32+00:00", "title": "Asian stocks fall as rate hike jitters mount, China leads losses", "content": "By Ambar Warrick\n\nInvesting.com -- Most Asian stock markets retreated on Thursday, tracking a weak lead-in from Wall Street as fears of rising interest rates and slowing economic growth kept traders wary of risk-driven assets.\n\nChina\u2019s Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 and Shanghai Composite indexes were among the worst performers for the day, down about 0.6% and 0.7%, respectively.\n\nChinese markets took little support from the People\u2019s Bank of China keeping its benchmark lending rates at historic lows, even as the move points to more liquidity support for local stocks.\n\nWhile data earlier this week showed that China\u2019s economy grew more than expected in the first quarter of 2023, growth was driven largely by a resurgence in consumption. The country\u2019s manufacturing sector, considered a bellwether for the economy, struggled to recover from a COVID-induced slowdown.\n\nHong Kong and China-listed stocks of electric carmakers also logged steep losses tracking Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), which sank 6% after the close as the firm\u2019s quarterly profit margin missed expectations amid an escalating price war.\n\nHong Kong shares of NIO Inc (HK:9866) (NYSE:NIO), Li Auto Inc (HK:2015) (NASDAQ:LI) and BYD Co Ltd (HK:1211) lost between 1.2% and 5%, while Shenzhen-listed units of Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd (SZ:300750), a major battery supplier to Tesla, fell 2.5%.\n\nBroader Asian markets moved in a flat-to-low range. Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 index rose 0.1%, while Australia\u2019s ASX 200 index moved little.\n\nThe Taiwan Weighted index lost 0.6%, with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TW:2330) (TSMC), the biggest stock on the index, trading lower ahead of its first-quarter results due later in the day. On the other hand, shares of China\u2019s Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (HK:0981), a major competitor to TSMC, surged 4.2% to a record high, also helping Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index log small gains.\n\nSentiment towards regional stocks was largely hampered by growing fears of rising global interest rates, after strong inflation readings from the UK and euro zone cemented expectations of more rate hikes by the Bank of England and European Central Bank.\n\nStory continues\n\nHawkish comments from Federal Reserve officials also saw markets question bets that the central bank will pause its rate hike cycle as soon as June, which in turn spurred a weak overnight close on Wall Street.\n\nFed Fund futures prices show markets pricing in an 85% chance the Fed will raise rates by 25 basis points in May, and also show a growing number of participants positioning for a similar hike in June.\n\nRising interest rates in major economies bode poorly for Asian markets, given that they diminish the returns from more risk-driven assets. Tighter monetary conditions also limit foreign capital flows into the region.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAsian stocks fall as rate hike jitters mount, China leads losses\n\nTruck maker Volvo hikes market outlook as Europe supply woes fade\n\nAd group Publicis sales jump as data-driven businesses strengthen", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/asian-stocks-fall-rate-hike-235832941.html", "symbols": ["0981.HK", "1211.HK", "2015.HK", "9866.HK", "HSI.INDX", "LI.US", "NIO.US", "TL0.F", "TL0.XETRA", "TSLA.MX", "TSLA.US", "TSLA34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.802, "neg": 0.079, "neu": 0.819, "pos": 0.102}}, {"date": "2023-04-19T23:38:49+00:00", "title": "Tesla's Q1 earnings call: What Twitter users are saying", "content": "Tesla's (TSLA) first quarter earnings numbers slightly missed analyst estimates, with recent price cuts weighing on the results.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk, along with other company leadership, took questions from analysts and investors in a call after the results were released.

The aluminum and alumina producer posted an adjusted loss per share of 23 cents versus exceptions of $3.10.\n\nSales for the quarter fell 19% to $2.67 billion, missing analyst estimates of $2.75 billion.\n\nHigher prices in both the alumina and aluminum categories were offset by decreased shipments. The company expects \"favorable raw materials, volume and lower production costs\" in the second quarter.\n\nAlcoa reaffirmed its alumina and aluminum shipments guidance for 2023 to come in between 12.7 million and 12.9 million metric tons, and between 2.5 million and 2.6 million metric tons, respectively.\n\nPresident and CEO Roy Harvey said the company is \"making important progress in stabilizing our operations, with teams working to improve on a minute-by-minute, day-by-day basis.

Profit excluding some items fell to 85 cents a share, slightly below the 86-cent average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg, while free cash flow slumped to a two-year low of $441 million. Analysts had expected free cash flow to reach $3.24 billion in the quarter.\n\nThe Austin, Texas-based electric-vehicle maker has been slashing prices to protect its leading market position. Tesla said its operating margin was 11.4% in the three-month period, down from 16% last quarter and 19.2% a year ago. Unusually, it didn\u2019t break out its automotive profit margin, which analysts have been watching closely.\n\nInvestors are showing some nervousness about that aggressive pricing strategy. The company\u2019s shares slid almost 5%, before paring slightly, in late trading in New York after the results were announced. The stock was up 47% so far this year through Wednesday\u2019s close.\n\n\u201cTesla is going through a rough patch,\u201d said Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management. \u201cThey are holding things together, but investors want to see some of these trends start to improve.\u201d\n\nProfit Advantage\n\nTesla\u2019s profitability sets it apart from other EV companies. The carmaker downplayed concern about its recent price cuts, saying its margins fell \u201cat a manageable rate.\u201d It said higher vehicle deliveries and raw materials costs played a factor in reducing profits.\n\n\u201cOur operating margins remain among the best in the industry,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said in a call with analysts.\n\nStory continues\n\nTesla has also benefited from tax credits included in the Biden administration\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act. The company reported regulatory credits of $521 million in the first quarter.\n\nMusk has repeatedly said he doesn\u2019t mind sacrificing profits to juice demand, arguing the high cost of Tesla cars are holding back potential customers. The base price of the Model 3 has now dipped below $40,000 for the first time in years, a roughly $7,000 cut from the start of the year.\n\nRead More: Tesla Makes Top-Selling Model 29% Cheaper in Just Three Months\n\nThe CEO is leaning on the fact Tesla can produce electric vehicles at scale to build on an existing lead over competitors, which are rolling out slick new battery powered vehicles. Tesla is working with an older stable of models, having last introduced a new passenger car \u2014 the model Y \u2014 in 2019.\n\nProduction of Tesla\u2019s long-awaited Cybertruck electric pickup is on track to start later this year at its plant in Texas, with a \u201cdelivery event\u201d expect in the third quarter. The company also is making progress on its next-generation vehicle platform, according to a shareholder letter. Those future product models will be unveiled at a \u201clater date,\u201d the company\u2019s design chief, Franz von Holzhausen, said at an event last month.\n\nThe EV maker said output this year will meet previous guidance for average annual growth of 50% over multiple years, and said it\u2019s on track to deliver about 1.8 million vehicles this year. It produced 440,808 cars and delivered 422,875 vehicles in the quarter, resulting in excess inventory of about 18,000. Orders are now outpacing production, Musk said on the call.\n\nTesla\u2019s solar deployments plunged in the first quarter, deploying only 67 megawatts, largely due to \u201cvolatile weather\u201d and other factors. It installed at least 94 megawatts in each of the preceding three quarters.\n\n--With assistance from Esha Dey and Brian Eckhouse.\n\n(Updates with details from call starting in seventh paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nAmericans Go Deeper Into Debt as They Use Buy Now, Pay Later Apps for Groceries Republicans Fight a Solar Boom That\u2019s Made Texas King of Clean Energy The Repo Man Returns as More Americans Fall Behind on Car Payments San Jose Plans Robocar Network Instead of Airport Shuttle Volkswagen Left Behind as China Goes All In on EVs\n\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-misses-first-quarter-estimates-202015555.html", "symbols": ["TL0.F", "TL0.XETRA", "TSLA.MX", "TSLA.US", "TSLA34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.99, "neg": 0.043, "neu": 0.864, "pos": 0.093}}, {"date": "2023-04-19T21:57:09+00:00", "title": "Tesla (TSLA) and IBM (IBM) Mixed in Q1, ZION Misses", "content": "Market indices continue to hug the middle of the road this trading week, closing for the third straight session within a half a percentage point on either side of zero. In today\u2019s case, these major indices were within a quarter-point of breakeven: the Dow lost -79 points, -0.23%, while the S&P came in at -0.01%. The Nasdaq reached +0.03% on the day and the small-cap Russell 2000 was +0.22%.\r\n\r\nPerhaps market participants were waiting until Tesla TSLA reported earnings after the bell? If so, their wait is over: Tesla beat earnings expectations by a penny to 85 cents per share over the Zacks consensus. Revenues, on the other hand, were shy of consensus estimates: $23.33 billion was reported for Q1, below the expected +23.47 billion. That said, Tesla quarterly sales were still more than +20% higher year over year.\r\n\r\nWith the company notably having cut prices on some of its key models (on key competition from other car manufacturers beginning to hit the market with their own EVs), analysts were taking a good look at Gross Margins for the quarter, and here they came in below expectations: +18.3% versus the +20.5% anticipated (subtracting government credits for EV purchases), with Operating Margins at +11.4% Operating Cash Flow at $2.5 billion. Its Energy business was way up in the quarter, though everyone knows Tesla\u2019s main business is in EVs.\r\n\r\nThe question for Tesla going forward is not whether they can take out consensus earnings estimates quarter over quarter \u2014 clearly they have, with this being the ninth-straight quarter of a positive earnings surprise. The question is whether we have seen the bottom in gross margins for this cycle, or whether further price cuts will take this +18.3% figure down further \u2014 and if so, how much farther? Tesla is still far and away the global EV leader, but price cutting may suggest that Tesla autos are not quite as in-demand as CEO Elon Musk continues to suggest.\r\n\r\nIBM IBM also reported Q1 earnings after today\u2019s close, with earnings of $1.36 per share beating the Zacks consensus by +8% on revenues of $14.25 billion, which is slightly less than the $14.27 billion expected. Consulting and Software revenues grew +2.8% and +2.6%, respectively, while RedHat business growth was +8% in the quarter. The company now expects full-year revenues to come in +3-5% on a constant currency basis.\r\n\r\nSalt Lake City-based regional bank Zions Bancorp ZION also released Q1 results this afternoon, missing on both top and bottom lines: earnings of $1.33 per share was notably below the $1.51 expected, on $839 million in revenues, which missed the Zacks consensus $844 million. Net Interest Income (NII), a key metric for regional banks, reached $679 million versus the $687.5 million analysts were looking for.

Revenue rose 24% to $23.33 billion, but the company's operating profit margin fell.\n\nTesla made an adjusted 85 cents per share in the first quarter, matching analyst estimates, according to FactSet. Analysts had expected profits to fall because of the price cuts.\n\nEarly in the quarter Tesla reduced U.S. prices on many of its models, then did it a second time early in March. The company slashed U.S. prices two more times in April, including overnight Wednesday, in an effort to boost demand. It trimmed them in Europe as well.\n\nThe net income drop came even though Tesla's sales last quarter rose 36% to a record 422,875 vehicles worldwide. That's largely because the average sale price per vehicle fell just over $5,000 from the first quarter of 2022 due to the price cuts. Analysts estimated that the average Tesla sold for $46,850 last quarter, down from $52,100 a year earlier.\n\nThe company produced nearly 18,000 more vehicles than it sold during the quarter, indicating softening demand.\n\nTesla\u2019s operating margin fell from 19.2% in the first quarter of last year to 11.4% this quarter.\n\nIn its earnings release, Tesla said it\u2019s aiming to leverage its position as a cost leader as other automakers try to handle electric vehicle costs.\n\n\u201cAlthough we implemented price reductions on many vehicle models across regions in the first quarter, our operating margins reduced at a manageable rate,\u201d the company said.\n\nThe company said it expects to reduce costs on its vehicles with improved production efficiency at its new factories and with lower shipping costs.\n\nAnalysts had been watching for whether the price cuts would affect Tesla's income and profit margins for the quarter amid rising interest rates and pesky inflation. The average new vehicle loan in the U.S. is now at 7%, according to Edmunds.\n\nStory continues\n\nTesla's sliding profit margin doesn't bode well for second-quarter net income since Tesla already has cut U.S. prices two times in April.\n\nTesla said its Model Y small SUV was the top-selling non pickup truck in the U.S. during the quarter, but it didn\u2019t give numbers. The company doesn\u2019t normally break out sales figures by region.\n\nShares of Tesla, which fell 2% during the trading day Wednesday, dropped another 4% in extended trading after the earnings were released.\n\nOvernight Wednesday, Tesla lopped $3,000 off the U.S. starting prices of all versions of the Model Y, its top-selling model. The cuts dropped the lowest-priced Dual Motor model to $46,990, the Long Range model went to $49,990 and the Y Performance dropped to $53,990. All versions of the Model Y were already eligible for the U.S. tax credit because the price limit for SUVs is $80,000.\n\nThe Model 3 Rear Wheel Drive, Tesla\u2019s lowest-priced vehicle, saw a cut to $39,990. It's eligible for the $7,500 tax credit because the price limit for cars is $55,000.

Intuitive Surgical shares soared 10.9% after its quarterly revenue and profit topped estimates.\n\nShares of Western Alliance Bancorp surged 24.1% after the company posted stronger-than-expected earnings, helping lift the SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF 3.9%.\n\nRegional banks have been in focus after the failure of Silicon Valley Bank last month prompted concerns about systemic risks.\n\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 1.28-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.11-to-1 ratio favored decliners.\n\nThe S&P 500 posted 16 new 52-week highs and one new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 59 new highs and 123 new lows.\n\nAbout 10 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, compared with the 10.6 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

In the years since, Tesla has returned 7,500% \u2014 even taking into account its recent selloff.\n\nBut investors should be wary of chasing past performance and betting exclusively on past industry leaders.

That\u2019s a big potential opening for Qnetic, a startup focusing on sustainable energy storage solutions, and other innovative green-energy startups.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Tesla, Inc. (TSLA), Oracle Corporation (ORCL) and Union Pacific Corporation (UNP). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nTesla shares have outperformed the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry over the year-to-date period (+49.6% vs. +22.8%), reflecting the company's solid long-term growth prospects despite growing competition in the space. The electric vehicle (EV) king is set to benefit from the soaring popularity of its Models 3 and Y.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks analyst expect deliveries to see an annualized growth of around 33% in 2023. Production ramp-up at gigafactory 4 (in Berlin) and 5 (in Austin) and introduction of new models, including Semi and Cybertruck, are set to support long-term deliveries growth.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Tesla\u2019s energy generation and storage revenues outlook is promising. Falling debt levels is another positive. While inflation and economic concerns could pose near-term challenges, we expect Tesla to deliver outsized returns in the long run on the back of output ramp-up and introduction of new models.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Tesla here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Oracle have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the past year (+22.3% vs. +3.2%). The company is benefiting from the ongoing momentum across its cloud business, driven by the strong uptake of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services and Autonomous Database offerings. Solid adoption of cloud-based applications, comprising NetSuite Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Fusion ERP and Fusion Human Capital Management (HCM), bodes well.\r\n\r\nSolid demand for the Oracle Dedicated Region Cloud@Customer is anticipated to drive the top line. Partnerships with Accenture and Microsoft is helping Oracle win new clientele. The company\u2019s share buybacks and dividend policy are noteworthy.\r\n\r\nHowever, higher spending on product enhancements, especially toward the cloud platform, amid increasing competition in the cloud domain is likely to limit margin expansion. We expect fiscal 2023 non-GAAP operating expenses to jump 14.1% over fiscal 2022.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Oracle here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Union Pacific have gained +8.3% over the past six months against the Zacks Transportation - Rail industry\u2019s gain of +11.2%. The company\u2019s efforts to reward its shareholders even in the current uncertain scenario please us. The company hiked dividend twice in 2021. In May 2022, UNP further upped its quarterly dividend by 10%.\r\n\r\nThe railroad operator is also active on the buyback front. In 2022, UNP bought back shares worth $6,282 million. The railroad operator paid dividends worth $3,159 million in 2022. UNP's strong free cash flow generating ability supports its shareholder-friendly activities. The uptick in overall volumes (up 2% year over year in 2002) as labor woes ease is an added positive.\r\n\r\nHowever, escalation in fuel costs as oil prices move north is a worry. This phenomenon induced a 20% rise in operating expenses in 2022. Fuel costs surged 68% last year. The same is likely to have been high in the March quarter too.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Union Pacific here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include ServiceNow, Inc.

It's Legal", "content": "Most billionaires don\u2019t get to where they are by earning a salary. And that also means they might pay less income tax than Americans who make a living through wages.\n\nAccording to a report from ProPublica, some billionaires in the U.S. paid little or no income tax relative to the vast amount of wealth they have accumulated over the years.\n\nThe report noted that Amazon.com Inc. Founder Jeff Bezos \u201cdid not pay a penny in federal income taxes\u201d in 2007 and 2011. It also pointed out that Tesla Inc. CEO Elon Musk paid no federal income tax in 2018 and investing legend George Soros did the same \u201cthree years in a row.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, billionaires do pay taxes \u2014 it\u2019s just that the amount is rather small compared to how much money they actually make. For instance, ProPublica\u2019s report showed that between 2014 and 2018, Bezos paid $972 million in total taxes on $4.22 billion of income. Meanwhile, his wealth grew by $99 billion, meaning the true tax rate was only 0.98% during this period.\n\nThe reality is, billionaires build their wealth from assets \u2014 like stocks and real estate. Their net worth goes up when these assets increase in value over time. But the U.S. tax system is not designed to capture the gains from such assets: Capital gains are typically taxed at lower rates than wages and salaries.\n\nBut of course, you don\u2019t need to be in the three-comma club to invest in these assets.\n\nCheck out:\n\nWarren Buffett's Investing Strategy Is More Relevant Than Ever In Today's Real Estate Market: Here\u2019s How You Can Act Now Before It\u2019s Too Late\n\nGetting A Piece Of The Action\n\nFor many well-known billionaires, the bulk of their wealth is tied to the companies they helped create.\n\nIf these companies are publicly traded, retail investors can hop on the bandwagon simply by purchasing shares. For those who want to follow Bezos, check out Amazon (AMZN). If you want to bet on Musk, look into Tesla (TSLA).\n\nHere\u2019s the neat part: When stocks go up in value, investors only pay tax on realized gains. In other words, if an investor doesn\u2019t sell anything, they don\u2019t have to pay capital gains tax even if their stock holdings have skyrocketed in value because the gains are not realized.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to ProPublica, that\u2019s why some billionaires choose to borrow against their assets instead of selling them. Doing so gives the ultra-wealthy money to spend while deferring taxes on capital gains indefinitely.\n\nThat said, when they do sell their shares, they can still get hit with a substantial tax bill. After Musk sold a ton of Tesla shares in 2021, he tweeted that he would pay over $11 billion in taxes that year.\n\nAnother popular option for billionaires is real estate, which comes with plenty of tax advantages as well.\n\nWhen you earn rental income from an investment property, you can claim deductions. These include expenses such as mortgage interest, property taxes, property insurance and ongoing maintenance and repairs.\n\nThere\u2019s also depreciation, which refers to the incremental loss of a property\u2019s value as a result of wear and tear. Real estate investors can claim depreciation for many years and accumulate significant tax savings over time.\n\nThe best part? The segment is becoming increasingly accessible to retail investors. There are publicly traded real estate investment trusts (REITs) that own income-producing real estate and pay dividends to shareholders. And if you don\u2019t like the stock market\u2019s volatility, there are also crowdfunding platforms that allow retail investors to invest directly in rental properties through the private market.\n\nRead next:\n\nWhiskey Is Barreling Towards Spectacular Gains.

Meanwhile, the so-called credit crunch many investors have feared really isn\u2019t materializing. Thus, right now may be an excellent time for investors to find high-quality stocks to buy.\n\nOn the inflation front, the Producer Price Index tumbled to its lowest level since January 2021. Regarding consumer spending, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) CFO Jeremy Barnum recently reported that \u201cU.S. consumers and small businesses\u2026continue to show resilience and remain on the path to normalization as expected.\u201d Directly contradicting bears\u2019 repeated earnings about companies\u2019 earnings tumbling, large banks reported powerful first-quarter results. Meanwhile, Bank of America stated that 90% of the 30 companies within the S&P 500 reported their earnings last week beat analysts\u2019 average earnings per share estimates. Accordingly, it\u2019s probably safe to say that no credit crunch is emerging, as bank deposits rose during the week that ended on 5 April, and bank loans and leases were flat.\n\nWith the macro environment looking great for stocks, the\u00a0Nasdaq already in a bull market, and the S&P 500 likely to join it by the end of Q2, there are plenty of stocks to buy could skyrocket in the next 12 months. Here are seven of the best such stocks to buy I think fit most investor portfolios right now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nXPEV XPeng $9.93 BNGO Bionano Genomics $0.71 PNC PNC Bank $126.80 SEDG SolarEdge $313.20 IBKR Interactive Brokers $84.15 MKTX MarketAxess $337.52 FANUY Fanuc $17.17\n\nXPeng (XPEV) Xpeng logo and P7 model in store XPEV stock\n\nSource: Andy Feng / Shutterstock.com\n\nFirst on this list of stocks to buy for those looking for a nice jump over the next year is XPeng\u2019s (NASDAQ:XPEV).\n\nThe Street looks pretty pleased with XPeng\u2019s latest news, as its shares jumped 15% on Apr. 17, alongside the announcement. Specifically, the Chinese high-tech electric vehicle maker introduced a \u201cnew platform architecture\u201d to reduce expenses significantly. The new platform will \u201ccut costs on adaptations for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and smart infotainment systems by 70% and 85%, respectively,\u201d Seeking Alpha reported.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlso boding well for XPEV stock was the company\u2019s reportedly strong sales of its core EV models in Norway. Notably, Norway was the first European country to which the EV maker expanded. As a result, I believe the Street is becoming excited about the company\u2019s ability to sell significant numbers of EVs in Europe and, eventually, the U.S.\n\nAlso noteworthy, as I pointed out in a previous article, Xpeng \u201chas truly become a global leader when it comes to developing driver-assistance technology\u201d and could launch a very lucrative robotaxi service in the not-too-distant future.\n\nBionano Genomics (BNGO) Bionano Genomics (BNGO) company logo on a website with blurry stock market developments in the background\n\nSource: Dennis Diatel / Shutterstock.com\n\nBionano Genomics (NASDAQ:BNGO) markets Saphyr, a product that, through optical genome mapping (OGM), enables scientists and healthcare professionals to detect structural variants of DNA that lead to diseases. Over the years, Bionano has shown through studies that, by seeing more structural variants than standard tools, Saphyr can enable scientists to develop new treatments for many diseases and diagnose multiple diseases in more patients earlier.\n\nFor many months, I\u2019ve written that convincing insurers to cover the use of Saphyr would be a massive game-changer for Bionano and BNGO stock. If healthcare professionals and patients can use the system for little or no cost, many more healthcare organizations would purchase the tool.\n\nNow it appears that, at last, the game-changing news will materialize soon. That\u2019s because the American Medical Association, at its May 2023 meeting, is expected to establish two CPT codes for OGM analysis. Specifically, the AMA\u2019s agenda shows that it will vote on establishing one code for \u201c(genome-wide) analysis for constitutional chromosomal abnormalities using\u201d OGM and another code for \u201cgenome-wide analysis for detection of\u201d blood cancers. The AMA states it will publish its decisions regarding these codes by June 2.\n\nMy research strongly indicates that the AMA\u2019s CPT codes determine which medical procedures for which healthcare providers can get reimbursed by insurers. For example, very well health, in a November 2022 article, reported that \u201cInsurers use CPT codes to determine how much money to pay providers.\u201d And the U.S. government\u2019s National Institute of Health states that \u201cThe CPT descriptive terminology and associated code numbers provide the most widely accepted medical nomenclature used to report medical procedures and services for processing claims.\u201d\n\nPNC Bank (PNC) hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocks\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/CC7\n\nPNC Bank (NYSE:PNC), America\u2019s sixth largest bank, reported excellent first-quarter results on April 14. Among the top stocks to buy in my purview right now, PNC\u2019s impressive revenue surge of nearly 20% year-over-year has moved this stock further up the list. Additionally, the company\u2019s net income climbed to $1.69 billion from $1.43 billion during the same period a year earlier.\n\nNotably, PNC bank has been relatively immune to the potential banking crisis that had many investors worried. During the company\u2019s recent earnings release, PNC noted that its average deposits increased 0.3% year-over-year, while its average loan total jumped to $325.5 billion from $291 billion. Indeed, that\u2019s not indicative of a bank facing financial troubles.\n\nAccordingly, like other American banks, PNC is well-positioned to benefit from the on-shoring trend and the continued strong U.S. labor market.\n\nIn a note to investors on Mar. 13, Citi named PNC as one of the large banks that will be a \u201cwinner\u201d from last month\u2019s banking mini-crisis. Citi described PNC as \u201cattractive.\u201d I agree.\n\nAdditionally, the current forward price-earnings ratio of PNC stock, based on analysts\u2019 average 2023 earnings per share estimates, is 8.2-times. Thus, if the company\u2019s 2023 earnings per share comes in 15% above the mean estimate, which I think is possible, and the company\u2019s price-earnings multiple reverts to 13-times, the level at which it was trading in March 2022, PNC stock could surge about 80% above its current levels by the end of the first quarter of next year.\n\nSolarEdge (SEDG) SolarEdge logo on phone with American flag background. SEDG stock\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe Street appears to be warming up to Israel\u2019s SolarEdge (NASDAQ:SEDG), which specializes in making inverters used in solar energy systems. Notably, shares of SEDG stock jumped 5% on Apr. 17. This followed initiated coverage by HSBC on 13 April, in which the bank started SEDG with a $271 price target and a buy rating.\n\nOne of the top inverter makers in the U.S., SEDG is expected to get a big boost from Europe, according to HSBC. The bank estimated the company\u2019s revenue would grow at a 20% annual clip from 2022 to 2025, making it among the stocks to buy right now.\n\nAt the end of March, SolarEdge\u2019s CFO, Ronen Faier,\u00a0reported that the company was continuing to benefit from \u201cextreme\u201d demand in Europe. Because of the continent\u2019s extremely high electricity prices, solar projects there pay for themselves in only a few years, he stated.\n\nFinally, Billionaire Steve Cohen, a very successful investor, bought SEDG stock in the fourth quarter of last year. That move speaks for itself.\n\nInteractive Brokers (IBKR) An image of a red arrow plunging downward overlaid on stock tickers; U.S. recession\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nDuring the pandemic, many American millennials became very interested in buying stocks. In addition to various websites that have discussed the phenomenon,\u00a0StockTwits has been much more active in the last few years than previously. Of course, that phenomenon is positive for Interactive Brokers (NASDAQ:IBKR).\n\nIndeed, with stocks entering \u201cbull\u201d mode, IBKR\u2019s financial results should start to soar. Additionally, given Washington\u2019s wide-ranging crackdown on cryptos, I think it\u2019s only a matter of time before the value of cryptos plunges again. As a result, many crypto traders will trade stocks instead, lifting Interactive Broker\u2019s results and boosting IBKR stock.\n\nDespite these positive catalysts, shares of IBKR stock are trading at a meager forward price-earnings ratio of just 14.5-times. This makes IBKR among the best stocks to buy for those seeking value in this market.\n\nMarketAxess (MKTX) an investor watches a ticker board of various stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nIn an article published a few years ago, I\u00a0explained that MarketAxess (NASDAQ:MKTX) \u201cowns and operates an electronic trading platform\u201d that enables individuals and firms \u201cto trade corporate bonds and other types of fixed-income instruments worldwide.\u201d\n\nMany individuals do not know how to trade bonds, and MarketAxess allows them to do so quickly.\n\nWith inflation tumbling and the Fed, in my view, eager to prevent more banks from running into trouble because of the declining value of bonds they hold, the central bank is likely to start cutting interest rates this summer. Accordingly, since bond prices move in the opposite direction as interest rates, bond prices are reasonably expected to surge. Of course, that phenomenon will benefit MarketAxess because many investors will be eager to invest in any sort of market that\u2019s surging.\n\nMarketAxess could also get a big lift from the coming collapse of cryptos, because some former crypto traders will turn to buy and sell bonds instead.\n\nLast month, despite intense worries over the banking mini-crisis, the company\u2019s total average daily credit volume climbed 4% versus the same period a year earlier. In contrast, its total credit trading volume reached $296 billion. Additionally, the company reported that it had enjoyed \u201ccontinued strong levels of estimated market share gains across most product areas.\u201d\n\nFanuc (FANUY) a worker with a tablet remotely operates a standalone robot arm\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nWith all the focus on artificial intelligence, many investors may overlook robots, which are also widely proliferating. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), for example, extensively use robots to perform many of the rote tasks that humans once carried out. The company explains that its \u201cSCARA robots are ideal for high-speed, precision applications such as assembly, pick and place, testing/inspection, dispensing, and packaging processes.\u201d\n\nJapan\u2019s Fanuc is one of the world\u2019s leading robot makers, and is one of the top stocks to buy in this sector, in my view. In the third quarter of 2022, its revenue from industrial robotics jumped to roughly $6.5 billion, from about $5.25 billion during the same period a year earlier. Moreover, in Q3, industrial robots accounted for 43% of its overall revenue, up from 38% in Q2 of 2021. Interestingly, the company reportedly sells over 100 types of robots.\n\nIn Fanuc\u2019s fiscal year, which ended in March 2022, its\u00a0operating income climbed to $2.5 billion from $1 billion the previous year. Finally, FANUY stock has a beautiful enterprise value/EBITDA ratio of just 0.15-times. Thus, given Fanuc\u2019s positive catalysts and low valuation, it\u2019s an excellent stock to buy.\n\nAs of the date of publication, Larry Ramer owned shares of BNGO and XPEV.

It's really quite simple, actually.\n\nShares of the EV maker have surged 70% off the Jan. 3 lows on the basic premise that Tesla's profit margins will stay strong in the face of repeated price cuts that began in the second half of 2022. But that singular focus misses the many nuances inherent to the first Tesla earnings report of 2023.\n\nFor starters, investors will be keen to see if CEO Elon Musk will even be on the earnings call. Musk held court with investors and analysts last earnings call for more than an hour. There is no guarantee the prickly billionaire will reappear as he said in the not too distant past he would not be on every earnings call. Musk does have a few other day jobs, as we know full well.\n\nSo there are those important optics on a story stock like Tesla.\n\nAs for the fundamentals of Tesla, investors want to get insight into a few things.\n\nFirst, can Tesla's gross profit margins still hit the 20% bogey in 2023 if it stays out there slashing prices with rivals like Ford, General Motors, Xpeng, Nio and BYD nipping at its heels. Yahoo Finance's Seana Smith reports on what Tesla's rivals are up to and it's impressive, and suggestive of further Tesla price cuts this year and into 2024. Sign up for the Yahoo Finance Morning Brief here.\n\nInvestors have come to expect Tesla's gross profit margins in one direction \u2014 up and to the right. Based on my number crunching, Tesla's gross profit margins have expanded from 16.6% for the 2019 reporting year to 25.6% last year. The Street is modeling for gross profit margins of 21.9% this year, as if to not factor in price cuts.\n\nIf Tesla comes out tonight voicing concern on that 20% gross profit margin mark, look for the stock to get hit as it would hint at downside risk relative to estimates. The 20% gross profit margin is a line item that fuels the entire engine that is Tesla \u2014 cash flow generation that allows for aggressive reinvestment in plants and technology. And then, a great story by hypeman Musk.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo any margin stumble would be unwelcome.\n\nThen there is chatter of a cheaper Model 2 vehicle in development. Tesla hasn't confirmed this, but investors would like to hear more from a company that has been producing the same-looking cars for five or six years and is battling increasing lower priced EV options.\n\n\"At current prices, there is likely more \"risk\" than \"reward\" in Tesla, especially with no clear timeline on a Model 2 reveal or SoP (we see volume ramping mid 2025 into 2026) and potential demand drag in 2H/2024 as Model Y saw an order surge during January's price cuts. If heightened US demand for Tesla's (now 5\u20136-year-old) 3/Y is not persistent beyond 1H '23, the company could face increased scrutiny in the wake of lower-priced EV competition coming to market (particularly from BYD in China), with the stock reacting accordingly,\" says EvercoreISI auto analyst Chis McNally.\n\nMcNally's Tesla analysis makes a lot of sense at the moment.\n\nAnd the Yahoo Finance team of yours truly, Brad Smith, and Pras Subramanian will look to make sense of Tesla's earnings call in our latest 'After the Call' taping. We will go live on the Yahoo Finance homepage and YouTube immediately after the Tesla call wraps so please do tune in.\n\nNow about that new Volkswagen EV...\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

The decision comes on the eve of its first quarter earnings report, which is expected to show a dip in profit.\n\nSpecifically, the company cut the cost of the Model Y by $3,000 and the Rear-Wheel Drive (RWD) Model 3 by $2,000, two of its most popular offerings. The change comes after new regulations on the sourcing of battery components reduced the RWD Model 3\u2019s eligibility for a full tax rebate.\n\nRead more\n\nWhole Foods has shut down a store in downtown San Francisco on safety concerns Your anxiety brings 4 distinct superpowers Americans may have seen the last of big rent hikes\n\nThe new $39,990 price tags confirms RWD Model 3 to be Tesla\u2019s least expensive car, but the vehicle\u2019s tax credit dropped from $7,500 to $3,500 because the minerals in its batteries come from China. Other Tesla vehicles aren\u2019t affected by the tax credit change.\n\nTesla has been slashing its prices as it seeks to retain dominance in an increasingly crowded EV market. In January, the company cut the price of its vehicles by as much as 20% after missing delivery estimates in 2022.\n\nIn China, Tesla has been engaged in a price war with manufacturers like Xpeng and Nio, slashing the cost of its locally produced Tesla by about 14%, making them almost 50% cheaper than those sold in the US. The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers publicly called for a pause on the discounts in March, as it looked to protect local companies.\n\nWhat to expect from Tesla\u2019s Q1 2023 earnings report\n\nTesla is expected to report lower earnings on higher sales, a trend that is largely in line with the EV industry as a whole. As the EV industry explodes, automakers like Volkswagen, Ford, and Jeep are spending billions of dollars to compete with Tesla, forcing the company to slash prices and ramp up production.\n\nStory continues\n\nTesla is expected to announce a 24.2% year-over-year increase in revenue, despite an anticipated 2.4% decrease in profit due to price cuts, according to data from Refinitiv via Reuters.\n\nTesla shares were slightly down 1.5% on the news of price reductions, as of 11:30 am in New York. The stock price overall is up 67% in the first quarter of 2023, recouping some losses after the company\u2019s shares lost roughly two-thirds of their value last year.\n\nWhich EVs are no longer eligible for the EV tax credit?\n\nThe US Treasury has changed the tax rebate policy for EV purchases, with two new requirements, each worth $3,750 in tax credits, going into full effect this month.\n\nThe new rules require that 50% of the value of the car\u2019s battery components must be produced or assembled in North America to qualify for the first credit. For the second, 40% of the value of minerals in the vehicle\u2019s battery\u2014such as lithium, cobalt, and nickel\u2014must be sourced from the United States or a designated trading partner.\n\nHere is a full list of EVs that will still be eligible under the new rules.\n\ndatawrapper-chart-2RXaL\n\nRelated stories:\n\n\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8The US is reducing tax credits for foreign-made EV models\n\n\ud83d\udd0c BYD profit surged by 400% last year as the electric vehicle market keeps going in China\n\n\ud83d\ude97 Tesla is the latest American manufacturer to invest in Mexico\n\nMore from Quartz\n\nThe world\u2019s biggest banknote printer said the demand for cash hit a two-decade low What were the world's busiest airports in 2022?\n\nSign up for Quartz's Newsletter.

Yes, including Tesla.\n\n5 Key Earnings Charts\n\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tesla (TSLA)\n\nTesla has beat 8 quarters in a row which is a nice earnings streak given the zero covid policy that was in China during most of that time as well as supply chain problems in the auto industry.\n\nShares of Tesla have rebounded in 2023 after falling last year. They are up 27% year-to-date. But over the last 2 years Tesla shares are down 27%.\n\nIs Tesla cheap? It trades with a forward P/E of 48 so on a P/E basis, it is not cheap. But Tesla investors don\u2019t care about valuation. They are buying it for the growth.\n\nWill you be tuning into Tesla\u2019s conference call this quarter?\n\n2. Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM)\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor also has a strong earnings surprise track record. It has beat on earnings 9 quarters in a row.\n\nShares of Taiwan Semiconductor have also rebounded this year, gaining 17%. But over the last 2 years they still have a return of a loss of 27%.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor is attractively valued with a forward P/E of 15.6.\n\nShould Taiwan Semiconductor be on your short list?\n\n3. Union Pacific Corp. (UNP)\n\nUnion Pacific, one of the large U.S. railroads, is coming off an earnings miss last quarter. It was its first miss since 2021, however.\n\nShares of Union Pacific are down 3.7% year-to-date and are in the red over the 2-year stack, falling 10.3% during that time.\n\nUnion Pacific is trading with a forward P/E of 17.4. It also pays a dividend, currently yielding 2.6%.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs Union Pacific a deal on this weakness?\n\n4. D.R. Horton, Inc. (DHI)\n\nD.R. Horton is a large, national homebuilder. D.R. Horton has an excellent earnings surprise track record, with just 3 misses in the last 5 years. Two of the misses were all the way back in 2018 and 2019. But the third miss was in late 2022.\n\nDespite slowing sales, shares of D.R. Horton are up 14.6% year-to-date and are now up 6% on a 2-year stack.\n\nIt\u2019s cheap, with a forward P/E of just 10.9.\n\nShould you be jumping into a homebuilder stock in 2023 like D.R. Horton?\n\n5. Pool Corp. (POOL)\n\nPool Corp. missed on earnings last quarter. It was its first miss since 2019, which is impressive because there was a pandemic in between the two misses.\n\nShares of Pool Corp. are up 12.2% year-to-date. But they have really fallen off their highs of the last 2 years and are now down 11% during that time period.\n\nBut are they a deal? Pool trades with a forward P/E of 20.\n\nWill Pool get back on track after the rare earnings miss last quarter?\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Market participants also are starting to walk back the notion that the Fed is done raising interest rates until after its May meeting. The Dow and the Nasdaq are both down -100 points currently, whereas the S&P 500 is -25 points in the red at this hour.\n\nWe see Q1 results from Morgan Stanley (MS) this morning, with the investment giant easily beating estimates on the top line while also posting a quarterly earnings beat. Earnings of $1.70 per share were 3 cents ahead of expectations, though still -19% year over year. Revenues of $14.52 billion were notably ahead of the $13.91 billion anticipated. Higher fixed income and wealth management in the quarter were balanced out by a -24% drop in investment banking. Yet shares are selling off on the news, -4% in this pre-market.\n\nU.S. Bancorp (USB) is out with Q1 earnings results ahead of the opening bell, outperforming on its bottom line by 3 cents to $1.16 per share, and above the 99 cents posted in the year-ago quarter. For revenues, the bank slightly edged out the Zacks consensus, $7.14 billion versus $7.13 billion expected \u2014 well above the $5.57 billion from Q1 2022. Shares of the Minneapolis-based bank have fallen -19.3% year to date, but are up +3% in today\u2019s pre-market.\n\nAfter today\u2019s close, we\u2019ll see Q1 earnings results from Tesla (TSLA) and IBM (IBM), two bellwether companies (perhaps \u201cformer bellwether\u201d would better describe IBM these days) reporting, both expected to come in below year-ago quarter\u2019s earnings but ahead on revenues \u2014 in Tesla\u2019s case, notably ahead. Tesla is also trying to keep its winning streak of 8 straight earnings beats alive. IBM will be trying to start a new string of earnings beats after last quarter\u2019s miss.\n\nAnd a new Beige Book awaits us as of 2pm ET today. This summary of economic events and forward outlook are a key into how the Fed is looking at our current financial state, and it follows last report\u2019s flat-to-up read on the economy. There are no major predictions over what\u2019s going to be in today\u2019s Beige Book; more often, analysts check the Beige Book to further calibrate what the Fed is likely to do at its next meeting.\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Market participants also are starting to walk back the notion that the Fed is done raising interest rates until after its May meeting. The Dow and the Nasdaq are both down -100 points currently, whereas the S&P 500 is -25 points in the red at this hour.\r\n\r\nWe see Q1 results from Morgan Stanley MS this morning, with the investment giant easily beating estimates on the top line while also posting a quarterly earnings beat. Earnings of $1.70 per share were 3 cents ahead of expectations, though still -19% year over year. Revenues of $14.52 billion were notably ahead of the $13.91 billion anticipated. Higher fixed income and wealth management in the quarter were balanced out by a -24% drop in investment banking. Yet shares are selling off on the news, -4% in this pre-market.\r\n\r\nU.S. Bancorp USB is out with Q1 earnings results ahead of the opening bell, outperforming on its bottom line by 3 cents to $1.16 per share, and above the 99 cents posted in the year-ago quarter. For revenues, the bank slightly edged out the Zacks consensus, $7.14 billion versus $7.13 billion expected \u2014 well above the $5.57 billion from Q1 2022. Shares of the Minneapolis-based bank have fallen -19.3% year to date, but are up +3% in today\u2019s pre-market.

Tesla is also trying to keep its winning streak of 8 straight earnings beats alive. IBM will be trying to start a new string of earnings beats after last quarter\u2019s miss.\r\n\r\nAnd a new Beige Book awaits us as of 2pm ET today. This summary of economic events and forward outlook are a key into how the Fed is looking at our current financial state, and it follows last report\u2019s flat-to-up read on the economy. There are no major predictions over what\u2019s going to be in today\u2019s Beige Book; more often, analysts check the Beige Book to further calibrate what the Fed is likely to do at its next meeting.\r\n\r\nQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

It also cut $2,000, or about 5%, from the starting price of a version of the Model 3 small sedan.\n\nTesla could have cut the Model 3 prices to make more cars loaded with options eligible for the U.S. government's $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit. With options, some Model 3s would exceed the government's $55,000 price limit for cars to be eligible for the credit.\n\nBut some industry analysts say demand may be slowing for the company's vehicles as more competition enters the market. Others say Tesla is using its high profit margins to take market share from competitors.\n\nBefore the opening bell Wednesday, shares of Tesla Inc. slid more than 3%. After major declines last year, the company's stock is bouncing back, up almost 50% so far in 2023.\n\nA message was left Wednesday morning seeking comment from Austin, Texas-based Tesla.\n\nThe cuts follow price drops earlier this week overseas, with analysts reporting cuts in Europe, Israel and Singapore.\n\nThey come just ahead of Tesla's first-quarter earnings release scheduled for after the closing bell on Wednesday.\n\nThe $3,000 price cuts on the Model Y dropped the lowest-priced Dual Motor model to $46,990. The Long Range model went to $49,990 and the Y Performance dropped to $53,990. All versions of the Model Y were already eligible for the U.S. tax credit because the price limit for SUVs is $80,000.\n\nThe Model 3 Rear Wheel Drive, Tesla's lowest-priced vehicle, saw a cut to $39,990.

REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/File Photo - REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nElon Musk has been accused of \u201ccovertly\u201d tearing up a Twitter policy designed to protect transgender people from harassment.\n\nThe social network quietly removed a section from its hateful conduct policy, which forbade users from deliberate misgendering or \u201cdeadnaming\u201d trans users.\n\nDeadnaming is where someone calls a transgender person by the name they were given at birth, rather than the name and gender they now identify with.\n\nMisgendering is where a person refers to someone using pronouns that do not reflect their gender identity.\n\nTwitter\u2019s previous policy on hateful conduct included a section that barred repeated \u201ctargeted misgendering or deadnaming of transgender individuals\u201d.\n\nAccording to an archived version of Twitter\u2019s policy, which bans attacks on protected categories, the rule was scrubbed on April 8 without announcement.\n\nSarah Kate Ellis, president of advocacy group GLAAD, said: \u201cTwitter\u2019s decision to covertly roll back its longtime policy is the latest example of just how unsafe the company is for users and advertisers alike.\u201d\n\nKelley Robinson, of the gay and trans rights group Human Rights Campaign, called the change \u201cdespicable\u201d.\n\nRival social networks, such as TikTok, still include specific blocks on misgendering and deadnaming in their policies.\n\nWhile Twitter removed the exception for misgendering from its rules, the Telegraph found it was still an option when reporting accounts, along with sexist stereotypes.\n\nAdvocacy groups have accused Mr Musk of watering down hate speech protections on Twitter since he took over the website by rolling back bans on thousands of accounts previously barred for breaking its rules.\n\nThey have called for advertisers to boycott the social network in response.\n\nMr Musk has insisted he has made changes to protect free expression online. The billionaire was approached for comment.\n\nOn Monday, the billionaire moved to limit the spread of hate speech posts by adding a new label on Twitter. Posts identified as including hateful material will have a disclaimer saying they may violate the social network\u2019s rules and have their visibility limited by the company\u2019s algorithm.\n\nStory continues\n\nDebates over gender identity have proved a flashpoint in the culture wars on both sides of the Atlantic and led to several fierce legal battles over whether \u201cmisgendering\u201d may be protected under free speech or equality rules.\n\nIn the US, the government's employment commission states that attempts to \u201cintentionally and repeatedly\u201d use the wrong name or pronouns at work could be unlawful in the workplace, although mistakes are unlikely to break employment rules.\n\nIn the UK, transgender identities are protected characteristics under hate crime legislation.\n\nAn employment tribunal ruled last year that gender critical beliefs \u2013 the assertion that sex is a fact of biology and cannot be changed \u2013 were protected under the equalities act.\n\nHowever, the judgement added the ruling does not mean \u201cthose with gender-critical beliefs can 'misgender' trans persons with impunity\u201d.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/elon-musk-accused-covertly-watering-103845698.html", "symbols": ["TL0.F", "TL0.XETRA", "TSLA.MX", "TSLA.US", "TSLA34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": -0.984, "neg": 0.108, "neu": 0.841, "pos": 0.051}}, {"date": "2023-04-19T10:27:41+00:00", "title": "Dow Jones Futures Fall As Netflix, ASML Decline; Tesla Cuts EV Prices Again With Earnings Due", "content": "Netflix and ASML fell after Q1 results.

(NYSE:F). Boy have things changed. RIVN stock is now 89% below its closing price on the first day it traded.\n\nIn the past 12 months, the company\u2019s share price has declined 63%, including a 19% pullback so far in 2023. The company and its stock are definitely on the downslope.\n\nRIVN stock has gotten knocked lower by a recent analyst downgrade at investment bank Piper Sandler (NYSE:PIPR). The analyst lowered its rating on the shares to \u201chold\u201d and dropped the price target by 76%, from $63 to $15 per share.\n\nPiper Sandler raised concerns about cost management and debt servicing at the electric vehicle start-up.\n\nOther issues weighing on Rivian stock include missed production and delivery targets, and a debt load that stands at $1.23 billion, raising doubts about its long-term viability.\n\nStory continues\n\nFisker (FSR) The Fisker logo hangs on display at the November 2011 International Auto Show.\n\nSource: Eric Broder Van Dyke / Shutterstock.com\n\nFisker (NYSE:FSR) is an electric vehicle maker named after the company\u2019s founder, Henrik Fisker. It aims to produce a fully electric SUV called the \u201cFisker Ocean.\u201d Things have not been going well for the company or its shareholders.\n\nFisker has said it plans to deliver 5,000 Ocean EVs before September this year, but has provided no firm dates for those deliveries. Fisker is also apparently waiting on some remaining approvals from the U.S. government, notably the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nDelays and a general lack of clarity have led to FSR stock tanking since the company went public in 2020. The share price has dropped 58% over the last 12 months, including a 28% plunge this year.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that a previous automotive company run by Henrik Fisker went bankrupt and the current incarnation of Fisker had, until 2021, been developing solid-state batteries but could not produce a workable battery. These facts have made many people on Wall Street skeptical of Fisker and its future prospects.\n\nNio (NIO) NIO logo, sign atop of North American headquarters and global software development center in Silicon Valley.

In the last six months, NIO stock has slumped 20%.\n\nOther Chinese automakers are making strides in challenging Nio in the domestic Chinese market. These include Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI) and BYD Company.\n\nNio is expanding into the European market, but has run into problems that have included a trademark infringement lawsuit from rival Volkswagen (ETR:VOW3) and intense competition on the continent. It all adds up to poor execution and dwindling sentiment that makes NIO stock one to avoid at all costs.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held a long position in GM.

Tesla's price cuts have prompted other automakers, including in China, to follow suit.\n\nBut the Shanghai show and the Seagull highlight a related dynamic: Chinese automakers are now leading the world in making EVs that compete on price and technology for the average budget.\n\nAnd many more of those cars from BYD and its rivals will be headed to Europe, Southeast Asia and other overseas markets, threatening established automakers, executives and analysts said.\n\nPatrick Koller, chief executive of French auto supplier Faurecia, said the entry-level EV market in Europe was an open lane for Chinese automakers.\n\n\u201cI think an attractive car for Chinese consumers will be an attractive car for a European consumer,\u201d he told Reuters.\n\nKoller said he had met with the CEO or chairman of more than two dozen Chinese automakers in Shanghai. Many are looking to export to Europe, he said.\n\nBecause of their \"fantastic competitive advantage,\" Koller predicted Chinese automakers could look to sell one million cars per year in Europe, equivalent to 8% of the market last year.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u2018OUR FAIR SHARE\u2019\n\nNio, which competes against the likes of BMW with its premium electric cars in China, said this week it would launch a new, more affordable EV brand with its first target market Europe, and is also evaluating the U.S. market.\n\n\u201cIf the overall user experience we can provide to European users is better somehow, we can establish our competitiveness,\u201d Qin Lihong, Nio\u2019s president said. \u201cWe can get our fair share.\u201d\n\nZeekr, a premium EV brand held by China\u2019s Geely, said it would be in most European markets by 2026.\n\nOther established automakers are taking advantage of China's more competitive supply chain by exporting from China. BMW, for example, exports the iX3 from China to Southeast Asia and Europe.\n\nRenault\u2019s Dacia ships the Spring EV, an entry-level hatchback like the BYD Seagull, to Europe and ranked as the second-largest EV exporter from China last year after Tesla.\n\nTesla shipped more than 271,000 Model Y and Model 3 sedans from its Shanghai factory last year to Europe and other markets, roughly a fifth of its sales.\n\nBut the biggest rise in exports is coming from Chinese automakers. China\u2019s car exports grew four-fold between 2020 and 2022 to top two million vehicles. Exports of all vehicle types are on track to top three million vehicles this year if the first-quarter pace is sustained.\n\nBYD\u2019s exports were up four-fold just last year, nearing 56,000 vehicles, led by its Yuan Plus EV, data from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers shows.\n\nBYD has not announced export plans for the Seagull, which is priced below what is now the best selling EV in China, the BYD Dolphin, which is priced from 116,800 yuan ($17,000) in China. BYD will start delivering Dolphin in Europe from the fourth quarter.\n\n\u201cMaybe we see it in Rome, Warsaw or Lisbon sooner than later,\u201d Morgan Stanley\u2019s Jonas, said of the hatchback. \u201cNo wonder Tesla keeps cutting price.\u201d\n\n(Reporting by Zhang Yan and Casey Hall; Writing by Kevin Krolicki; Editing by Mark Potter)", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ev-costs-tumble-china-export-095056019.html", "symbols": ["TL0.F", "TL0.XETRA", "TSLA.MX", "TSLA.US", "TSLA34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.978, "neg": 0.036, "neu": 0.89, "pos": 0.074}}, {"date": "2023-04-19T09:50:41+00:00", "title": "Reports: Tesla factory where worker died had safety weakness", "content": "SHANGHAI (AP) \u2014 Government inspectors concluded Tesla Inc.\u2019s Shanghai factory where an employee died in a Feb. 4 accident has weaknesses in its safety measures, news reports said Wednesday.\n\nThe emergency bureau of Shanghai\u2019s Pudong district recommended an unspecified penalty for Tesla, the business news magazine Caixin and other outlets reported.

The average estimate for automotive gross margin in the first quarter has fallen by about a fifth since late-December. Yet that hasn\u2019t prevented the stock from staging a sharp rally this year, leaving scope for disappointment.\n\n\u201cGoing into the earnings people are going to be saying is it worth the big move or has the market gotten ahead of itself?,\u201d said Catherine Faddis, senior portfolio manager at Fernwood Investment Management. \u201cMargins are going to be very consequential with the market trying to decide does this stock keep running or does it have a little pull back.\u201d\n\nHigh profitability, coupled with the promise of rapid future growth, have long been key drivers of Tesla\u2019s vast premium over other car manufacturers. After a 50% gain this year, the stock trades at around 47 times forward earnings, compared with single-digit multiples for both General Motors Co. and Ford Motor Co. The S&P 500 Index\u2019s average sits at around 19 times.\n\nWhile the shares have been driven by a broader resurgence in investor appetite for growth assets, as well as the boost to the EV industry from Biden administration\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act, profit projections have been falling. That largely reflects the impact of price cuts Tesla has made to fuel sales, the latest of which came on the eve of the earnings announcement.\n\nStory continues\n\nAutomotive gross margin is seen declining to 23% in the first quarter, from 25.9% in the previous three months, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Profit predictions have fallen 28% since late December to 86 cents a share.\n\nInvestors are divided on whether the company can maintain its January guidance for the automotive gross margin to stay above 20%, according to Barclays Plc analyst Dan Levy. While Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk has expressed willingness to sacrifice margins in order to drive sales, first-quarter \u201cearnings will be the first real test of whether this is taking place to a major extent,\u201d Levy wrote in a note Monday.\n\nIn cutting prices, Tesla is testing Musk\u2019s theory that small changes in price have a big effect on demand.\n\n\u201cThe desire for people to own a Tesla is extremely high,\u201d the CEO said at a March 1 investor day in Austin, Texas. \u201cThe limiting factor is their ability to pay for a Tesla.\u201d\n\nStubbornly high inflation, steep borrowing costs and the fear of a recession have altered the landscape for EV demand this year. And Tesla\u2019s discounts have triggered a chain reaction throughout the auto industry as other automakers follow suit.\n\n\u201cPrice cuts underscore the highly competitive nature of the auto market, where sustained high margins and high volume is unprecedented, and which we believe is necessary to justify Tesla\u2019s premium valuation,\u201d Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi wrote in a note last week.\n\nBulls remain optimistic that the company can maintain a strong advantage over rivals in terms of profitability. On average, analysts estimate Tesla\u2019s 2023 overall gross margin at around 22%, compared with GM\u2019s 17% and Ford\u2019s 15%, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\n\n\u201cTesla represents a better risk-adjusted investment opportunity compared to most other EV-related names,\u201d Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas wrote in a note Monday. \u201cWe believe the company\u2019s cost and engineering leadership will, over time, provide greater growth potential and adjacent revenue opportunity vis-\u00e0-vis the competition.\u201d\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nThe year-to-date advance in major technology and internet stocks has meant a decline in volatility associated with the Nasdaq 100. The CBOE NDX Volatility Index has dropped for five straight sessions, ending Tuesday at its lowest since January 2022. The close of 21.41 compares with an October peak of nearly 40, as well as a five-year average of 26. The Nasdaq 100 ended little changed on Tuesday.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nNetflix Inc. will begin cracking down this quarter on US viewers who share someone else\u2019s account, predicting plans to charge such customers will boost growth in the second half of the year. Apple Inc. is racing to build a trove of software and services for its upcoming mixed-reality headset, seeking to win over potentially wary consumers with apps that use the device\u2019s novel 3D interface. Meta Platforms Inc. is set to commence companywide layoffs on Wednesday as it restructures teams and works toward founder Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s goal of greater efficiency. Walt Disney Co. plans to cut thousands of jobs next week, including about 15% of the staff in its entertainment division, people familiar with the matter said. ASML Holding NV shares fell in Amsterdam trading on concerns that falling demand in the broader semiconductor industry would have a long-term impact on its results.

The Bank of England\u2019s goal is to keep inflation at 2% in the medium-term.\n\nThe ONS also reported that fuel prices fell by 5.9% in the year to March 2023, compared with a rise of 4.6% in February.\n\nGiles Coghlan, chief market analyst, consulting for HYCM, said: \u201cAfter last month\u2019s shock CPI reading, today\u2019s print still shows double digit inflation. This is a sign that inflation is not yet back on track and the longed-for decline towards pre-Covid levels is not quite there. The question investors will be asking now is, where does the Bank of England go from here? The general consensus at the moment is that the central bank will need to hike by 25bps in the May meeting, especially with the strong wage growth seen earlier in the week.\u201d\n\nCoghlan said the issue for the Pound and for the Bank of England (BoE) is whether the latest data merits continued tightening.\n\n\u201cThe surge in average earnings will no doubt be sounding alarm bells that the dreaded wage-price spiral could become entrenched in the UK, which has moved the dial in favour of another 25bps hike when the monetary policy committee convenes next month. Some investors are fearing that the dreaded wage-price spiral could be about to bite and it will be hard for the BoE to not hike rates next month,\u201d he added.\n\nRead more: UK inflation eases but remains above 10% as food prices soar\n\nEuro area inflation data for March is also due out this morning, which will determine the European Central Bank\u2019s monetary policy path.

It demonstrates that the firm has recognised that its competitive advantage has eroded, and that in order to fight for a larger part of the market, it must first comprehend the mechanism of competition. Of course, lowering prices implies lowering profit margins, and the issue now is: how do we know which will support its future earnings.\u201d\n\nNetflix earnings\n\nNetflix (NFLX) shares fell 3% after plunging 10% amid mixed first-quarter earnings results on Tuesday.\n\nThe streaming giant reported earnings per share at $2.88 (\u00a32.31), beating an estimated $2.86, while its revenue was $8.16bn, shy of the $8.18bn estimated by Bloomberg consensus estimates.\n\nThe net subscriber was 1.75 million, more than an expectation of 1.38 million. Netflix said it delayed the password-sharing crackdown.\n\n\u201cToday will be dominated by the earnings released by Netflix in the technology sector. The corporation reported yesterday night that it would not take a strong stance against password sharing, which has displeased investors. What is critical to focus on, though, is discretionary money, which has fallen dramatically \u2013 consumers are making cuts. Nobody has extra money, and everyone is thinking about reducing down,\u201d Naeem Aslam said.\n\nAslam further noted that overall, things are difficult, and Netflix's subscriber levels remain susceptible.\n\n\u201cNonetheless, Netflix's earnings per share (EPS) were higher than predicted. This is obviously a nice conclusion in the face of everything else being bad, and if investors continue to concentrate on this and less on its sales, we may see some positive movement,\u201d he added.\n\nRead more: Netflix misses subscriber estimates, reveals password crackdown to hit U.S. in Q2\n\nUS earnings\n\nIn the US, investors monitored more earnings reports on Monday, including from Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Bank of America (BAC) and Goldman Sachs (GS).\n\nJohnson & Johnson topped Wall Street\u2019s expectations and reported adjusted earnings of $2.68 a share for the first quarter of 2023, up from $2.67 in the same period the previous year \u2013 and quarterly revenue of $24.75bn, up 5.6% from the prior year.\n\nThe pharmaceutical giant also raised its full-year adjusted earnings expectations to a range of $10.60-$10.70 per share, from $10.45-$10.65 \u2013 and raised its full-year sales expectations to a range of $97.9bn-$98.9bn from $96.9bn-$97.9bn.\n\n\u201cJohnson & Johnson reported another quarter of strong results across our business in the first quarter of 2023,\" Joe Wolk, executive vice president and chief financial officer at Johnson & Johnson, said.\n\n\u201cWe remain focused on the successful separation of our Consumer Health business and are confident in the long-term growth prospects of our Pharmaceutical and MedTech businesses that continue to drive meaningful value for Johnson & Johnson shareholders,\u201d Wolk added in a statement.\n\nUS bank results\n\nBank of America earnings also topped expectations with its profits up 15% to $8.2bn, while its revenue grew 13% to $26.3bn, beating the expected $25.2bn that analysts had forecast for the bank.\n\n\u201cEvery business segment performed well as we grew client relationships and accounts organically and at a strong pace. Led by 13% year-over-year revenue growth, we delivered our seventh straight quarter of operating leverage. We further strengthened our balance sheet and maintained strong liquidity,\u201d Brian Moynihan, chair and chief executive of Bank of America, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe delivered earnings of $0.94 per share, up 18% over Q1-22, in an economy with modestly slower GDP growth. Our results demonstrate how our company\u2019s decade-long commitment to responsible growth helped to provide stability in changing economic environments,\u201d he added.\n\nGoldman Sachs, meanwhile, said revenue fell 5% to $12.22bn, which was below analyst estimates of $12.8bn, as a result of consumer loan losses and weaker than expected bond trading.\n\nThe bank said net income for the first quarter was $3.2bn, down from $3.8bn in the same period last year.\n\nIt noted a $470m loss from a partial sale and markdown of its consumer loan portfolio but said it was partly offset by a release of credit reserves.\n\nInvestors will also be keeping an eye on the outlook for interest rates ahead of the next Federal Reserve meeting in May. It\u2019s widely expected among analysts that the Fed will raise rates by another quarter percentage point.\n\nWatch: Netflix password-sharing crackdown, ad tier update: Key takeaways from the streamer's earnings call<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:1;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NFLX?p=NFLX&.tsrc=fin-srch\\\">NFLX</a>) first quarter <a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:2;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netflix-earnings-first-quarter-2023-april-18-200640705.html\\\">earnings results were mixed, </a>with the streamer slightly missing analysts' revenue projections ($8.16 billion versus<strong>\u00a0</strong>$8.18 billion expected).

In mainland China, the Shanghai Composite (000001.SS) also closed in the red \u2013 it dropped 0.64% to 3,371.53 points.\n\nIn the US, stocks closed mixed after the release of more big earnings reports. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Bank of America (BAC) beat analyst forecasts, while Goldman Sachs (GS) missed estimates.\n\nThe Dow Jones (^DJI) fell 0.03% to 33,976.63 points, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.09% to 4,154.87 points. The tech-heavy NASDAQ (^IXIC) closed down, by 0.04% to 12,153.41.\n\nEarnings will continue to take centre stage today with Tesla (TSLA) and Morgan Stanley (MS) set to post results.\n\nPound\n\nThe pound (GBPUSD=X) gained against the US dollar by 0.12% to 1.24 following the release of the latest UK inflation data. Against the euro, the sterling (GBPEUR=X) also rose by 0.30% to 1.13.\n\nOil prices\n\nCrude prices fell on Wednesday despite better-than-expected growth figures from China on Tuesday.\n\nStory continues\n\nUS crude oil, or West Texas Intermediate (CL=F), declined 0.52% to $80.44 a barrel, while Brent crude (BZ=F) also fell \u2013 by 0.50% to $84.35 a barrel.\n\nEconomic data\n\nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) fell to 10.1% last month \u2013 a return to a decline after a shock increase to 10.4% in February due to soaring food prices.\n\nCity economists had forecast a cooling in the UK\u2019s March inflation rate but for a reading of 9.8%. The Bank of England\u2019s goal is to keep inflation at 2% in the medium-term.\n\nVictoria Scholar noted that while price pressures eased for motor fuels, clothing, restaurants, and hotels, the upward effects remain from food and drinks, recreation and culture.\n\n\u201cFood and non-alcoholic drinks inflation rose from 18.2% in February to 19.2% in March, the highest level in 45-years, driven by bread and cereals inflation which hit a record high. Core inflation which strips out the more volatile components like energy, food, alcohol, and tobacco rose by 6.2% year-on-year, also ahead of expectations for 6%,\u201d she said.\n\nGiles Coghlan, chief market analyst, consulting for HYCM, also commented and said the latest data is a sign that inflation is not yet back on track and the longed-for decline towards pre-Covid levels is not quite there.\n\n\u201cThe question investors will be asking now is, where does the Bank of England go from here? The general consensus at the moment is that the central bank will need to hike by 25bps in the May meeting, especially with the strong wage growth seen earlier in the week.\u201d\n\nCoghlan also said the issue for the Pound and for the Bank of England (BoE) is whether the latest data merits continued tightening.\n\n\u201cThe surge in average earnings will no doubt be sounding alarm bells that the dreaded wage-price spiral could become entrenched in the UK, which has moved the dial in favour of another 25bps hike when the monetary policy committee convenes next month. Some investors are fearing that the dreaded wage-price spiral could be about to bite and it will be hard for the BoE to not hike rates next month,\u201d he added.\n\nRuss Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, was of the view that the latest data will only strengthen the argument for the Bank of England to keep pushing up interest rates.\n\nRead more: UK inflation eases but remains above 10% as food prices soar\n\nEuro-area inflation data for March is also due out this morning, which will determine the European Central Bank\u2019s monetary policy path. It follows the ECB\u2019s chief economist, Philip Lane, saying on Tuesday that another increase in rates would be appropriate in May.\n\nThe figures are expected to show consumer prices in the euro-area up 6.9% in the year to March, in line with price increases in February, while core inflation is forecast to remain unchanged at 5.7%.\n\nTesla results\n\nTesla (TSLA) stock will also be on the radar of investors \u2013 its results will be released today.\n\nTina Teng, analyst at CMC Markets, said Tesla\u2019s profit margin is in doubt due to its generous price cuts, despite a record Q4 delivery number.\n\n\u201cAlso, whether the EV maker can achieve its 2 million delivery number becomes suspicious amid severe Chinese carmaker competition,\u201d she added.\n\nNaeem Aslam, chief investment officer at Zaye Capital Markets, also commented: \u201cThe business announced more price reduction for its vehicles ahead of reporting. It demonstrates that the firm has recognised that its competitive advantage has eroded, and that in order to fight for a larger part of the market, it must first comprehend the mechanism of competition. Of course, lowering prices implies lowering profit margins, and the issue now is: how do we know which will support its future earnings.\u201d\n\nNetflix earnings\n\nNetflix (NFLX) shares fell 3% after plunging 10% amid mixed first-quarter earnings results on Tuesday.\n\nThe streaming giant reported earnings per share at $2.88 (\u00a32.31), beating an estimated $2.86, while its revenue was $8.16bn, shy of the $8.18bn estimated by Bloomberg consensus estimates.\n\nThe net subscriber was 1.75 million, more than an expectation of 1.38 million. Netflix said it delayed the password-sharing crackdown.\n\n\u201cToday will be dominated by the earnings released by Netflix in the technology sector. The corporation reported yesterday night that it would not take a strong stance against password sharing, which has displeased investors. What is critical to focus on, though, is discretionary money, which has fallen dramatically \u2013 consumers are making cuts. Nobody has extra money, and everyone is thinking about reducing down,\u201d Naeem Aslam said.\n\nAslam further noted that overall, things are difficult, and Netflix's subscriber levels remain susceptible.\n\n\u201cNonetheless, Netflix's earnings per share (EPS) were higher than predicted. This is obviously a nice conclusion in the face of everything else being bad, and if investors continue to concentrate on this and less on its sales, we may see some positive movement,\u201d he added.\n\nRead more: Netflix misses subscriber estimates, reveals password crackdown to hit U.S. in Q2\n\nUS earnings\n\nIn the US, the focus will be on Morgan Stanley\u2019s earnings later.\n\nIt follows results on Tuesday from Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Bank of America (BAC) and Goldman Sachs (GS).\n\nJohnson & Johnson topped Wall Street\u2019s expectations and reported adjusted earnings of $2.68 a share for the first quarter of 2023, up from $2.67 in the same period the previous year \u2013 and quarterly revenue of $24.75bn, up 5.6% from the prior year.\n\nThe pharmaceutical giant also raised its full-year adjusted earnings expectations to a range of $10.60-$10.70 per share, from $10.45-$10.65 \u2013 and raised its full-year sales expectations to a range of $97.9bn-$98.9bn from $96.9bn-$97.9bn.\n\n\u201cJohnson & Johnson reported another quarter of strong results across our business in the first quarter of 2023,\" Joe Wolk, executive vice president and chief financial officer at Johnson & Johnson, said.\n\n\u201cWe remain focused on the successful separation of our Consumer Health business and are confident in the long-term growth prospects of our Pharmaceutical and MedTech businesses that continue to drive meaningful value for Johnson & Johnson shareholders,\u201d Wolk added in a statement.\n\nUS bank results\n\nBank of America earnings also topped expectations with its profits up 15% to $8.2bn, while its revenue grew 13% to $26.3bn, beating the expected $25.2bn that analysts had forecast for the bank.\n\n\u201cEvery business segment performed well as we grew client relationships and accounts organically and at a strong pace. Led by 13% year-over-year revenue growth, we delivered our seventh straight quarter of operating leverage. We further strengthened our balance sheet and maintained strong liquidity,\u201d Brian Moynihan, chair and chief executive of Bank of America, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe delivered earnings of $0.94 per share, up 18% over Q1-22, in an economy with modestly slower GDP growth. Our results demonstrate how our company\u2019s decade-long commitment to responsible growth helped to provide stability in changing economic environments,\u201d he added.\n\nGoldman Sachs, meanwhile, said revenue fell 5% to $12.22bn, which was below analyst estimates of $12.8bn, as a result of consumer loan losses and weaker than expected bond trading.\n\nThe bank said net income for the first quarter was $3.2bn, down from $3.8bn in the same period last year.\n\nIt noted a $470m loss from a partial sale and markdown of its consumer loan portfolio but said it was partly offset by a release of credit reserves.\n\nWatch: Netflix password-sharing crackdown, ad tier update: Key takeaways from the streamer's earnings call<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:1;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NFLX?p=NFLX&.tsrc=fin-srch\\\">NFLX</a>) first quarter <a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:2;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netflix-earnings-first-quarter-2023-april-18-200640705.html\\\">earnings results were mixed, </a>with the streamer slightly missing analysts' revenue projections ($8.16 billion versus<strong>\u00a0</strong>$8.18 billion expected).

Tesla earnings are due after the close, while U.K. inflation is proving to be particularly sticky.\n\n1. Netflix disappoints with guidance, subscriber adds\n\nThe new earnings season received results from Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) after the close Tuesday, and while the streaming giant\u2019s first quarter earnings topped estimates, its guidance fell short of expectations even after the launch of its ad-supported tier.\n\nNetflix also added 1.75 million users, compared with a loss of 200,000 in the same period last year, but that missed estimates of over 2M net adds. It also forecast that second quarter paid net adds were expected to be \u201croughly similar to Q1 \u201923.\u201d\n\nThe company serves as a bellwether for the streaming industry, in which growth has slowed as competition has intensified. Its stock fell 1% in after-hours trading.\n\nThere are more earnings to digest Wednesday, including major lender Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) before the open and electric vehicle giant Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) after the closing bell.\n\n2. Fox settles Dominion lawsuit\n\nFox Corp. (NASDAQ:FOXA), the owner of Fox News, has settled a defamation lawsuit by Dominion Voting Systems for $787.5 million, the largest ever settlement struck by an American media company.\n\nDominion had sought $1.6 billion in damages in the lawsuit filed in 2021 over the media giant\u2019s coverage of false vote-rigging claims in the 2020 U.S. election.\n\nAs expensive as this settlement is, Fox\u2019s lawyers must have thought it still represented a good deal given that alongside the $1.6B, Dominion was also seeking punitive damages in any amount jurors see fit.\n\nAdditionally, the deal spared a number of well-known Fox employees, including the company\u2019s 92-year-old chairman Rupert Murdoch, from having to answer potentially embarrassing questions.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile this agreement ends this particular lawsuit, another U.S. voting company, Smartmatic, is seeking $2.7B from Fox in a similar lawsuit pending in New York County Supreme Court.\n\nThe fact Fox chose to settle is likely to provide Smartmatic with confidence of a similar result.\n\nFox stock fell 1.5% in premarket trading.\n\n3. Futures lower; Tesla earnings in focus\n\nU.S. futures traded lower Wednesday, as investors digested mixed earnings reports from a number of major companies.\n\nAt 05:00 ET (09:00 GMT), the Dow futures contract dropped 110 points or 0.3%, S&P 500 futures fell 18 points or 0.4%, and Nasdaq 100 futures retreated 75 points or 0.6%.\n\nWhile Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) beat expectations Tuesday, other big companies such as Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Netflix [see above] fell short on some measures.\n\nTesla leads the earnings schedule Wednesday after the close, and investors will also pay attention to the release of the Fed\u2019s Beige Book later in the session as it could provide more color for investors on the economic conditions around the country.\n\n4. U.K. inflation remains particularly sticky\n\nThe U.K. received another nasty inflation surprise Wednesday, as its March CPI remained in double figures, western Europe's highest rate of consumer price inflation.\n\nData released earlier Wednesday showed CPI came in at 10.1% in March, a small drop from February's 10.4%, and above the forecast 9.8%.\n\nThis elevated level was largely driven by prices of food and non-alcoholic drinks rising by 19.1% in annual terms in March - the biggest such increase since August 1977.\n\nLast month the Bank of England said it expected inflation to \"fall significantly\" in the second quarter, forecasting March inflation of 9.2%, and thus this number is likely to prompt the central bank to raise interest rates next month once more.\n\nSterling rose as a result, with GBP/USD up 0.2% to 1.2435.\n\nThe final iteration of the Eurozone\u2019s March consumer price index was also released earlier Wednesday, with the CPI rising 0.9% on the month in March, an annual rise of 6.9%, a drop from the 8.5% seen in February.\n\n5. Oil prices drop on fears of slowing U.S. growth\n\nCrude prices weakened Wednesday, weighed by concerns that another hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve will hit economic activity in the world\u2019s largest economy and major oil consumer.\n\nBy 09:00 ET, U.S. crude futures were down 1.8% at $79.40 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 1.8% to $83.25 per barrel.\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard called Tuesday for continued interest rate hikes to counter persistent inflation, while his colleague Atlanta Federal Reserve President Raphael Bostic suggested one more interest rate rise of 25 basis points was likely in May.\n\nThere was some good news Tuesday, as an industry report from the American Petroleum Institute showed U.S. crude stocks fell about 2.68M barrels last week.\n\nThe official inventory report by the Energy Information Administration is due to be released at 10:30 ET.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nNetflix adds, Fox lawsuit and U.K. inflation - what's moving markets\n\nCitigroup raises global growth forecast, sees U.S. recession in Q4\n\nChina may hold lending benchmarks steady as recovery remains on track -analysts", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netflix-adds-fox-lawsuit-u-052711417.html", "symbols": ["BAC.US", "FOX.US", "FOXA.US", "GS.US", "GSPC.INDX", "JNJ.US", "MS.US", "NFLX.US", "TSLA.US"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": -0.98, "neg": 0.092, "neu": 0.849, "pos": 0.058}}, {"date": "2023-04-19T05:00:00+00:00", "title": "Tesla Earnings Are Likely to Drop.

That revenue figure would represent a slight dip from the $24.32 million Tesla reported in Q4, but 24.6% higher than a year ago.\n\nIn terms of profit, Tesla is expected to report adjusted net income of $3.03 billion \u2014 a billion less than last quarter and $700 million less than a year ago. With revenue staying flat-ish and profit dipping, the effects of margin compression could be at play here.\n\nTesla instituted a number of price cuts in the U.S., Asia, and some European markets in Q1 of this year, most recently in the U.S. just last week. Investors will be watching how these price cuts affect gross margin figures, which last quarter came in at 23.8%, with automotive gross margin hitting 25.9% \u2014 both slightly less than quarter before.\n\nWall Street banks such as Evercore ISI have attempted to quantify the price cuts. \u201cIf we assume ~$2k US [price] cut ave translates to ~$1k global and then half of that is offset by cost improvements\u2026 then $500 cut to gross profit equates to ~100bps of gross margin pressure and implies 19% Q2/Q3 Auto gross margins (rough math,\u201d the analysts said earlier this month.\n\nSimilarly, Ryan Brinkman of JPMorgan has been wary of the price cut effect on Tesla\u2019s profitability, as well as other EV-makers.\n\n\u201cWe have been cautious about the profit impact of Tesla\u2019s price cuts, writing that the lower prices are negative overall for Tesla, less negative for traditional automakers such as GM and Ford (given they are now likely to lose even more money in the interim on EVs, although have other profit centers to offset such losses), and most negative of all for pure-play battery electric automakers competing with Tesla (such as Rivian), as they, too, are likely to lose more money on EVs although do not have profits elsewhere to offset these losses,\u201d Brinkman wrote earlier in April.\n\nStory continues Tesla CEO Elon Musk views the new Tesla Model Y at its unveiling in Hawthorne, California on March 14, 2019.

In Q1 Tesla delivered around 423K vehicles and produced 440K globally; analysts at Evercore, for instance, would like to hear any indication of how Q2 deliveries are tracking, and if the order backlog is growing.

Xpeng has said the G6 will be priced from just under $30,000, nearly $10,000 less than the lowest-priced Shanghai-built Model Y.\n\n\"It's obvious the design of the (G6) came from the Model Y,\" industry analyst Sandy Munro told Reuters. \"This is not a surprise.

Tesla executives said then that the new process, which it expects to implement next year at the company's new plant in Mexico, will enable it to dramatically shrink the factory footprint and halve production costs.\n\nTesla believes the new assembly process it is building around the simplified platform will enable it to put a sub-$30,000 electric vehicle into the market within the next two years.\n\nXpeng describes SEPA 2.0 as a \u201csmart EV architecture\u201d that integrates a software, data and hardware platform called X-EEA, as well as a new Xmart vehicle operating system that leverages artificial intelligence, sensors and software to control in-vehicle services and functions. All components were developed in-house, the company said.\n\nTo produce vehicles based on the new platform, a \u201csmart manufacturing system\u201d will be rolled out at Xpeng\u2019s Zhaoqing and Guangzhou plants over the next two years as SEPA 2.0 is deployed across at least 10 future models, starting in late 2024 with the new G6 SUV.\n\n(Reporting by Paul Lienert in Detroit, Editing by Ben Klayman and Matthew Lewis)", "link": "https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/analysis-china-xpeng-takes-cues-190815698.html", "symbols": ["TL0.F", "TL0.XETRA", "TSLA.MX", "TSLA.US", "TSLA34.SA", "XPEV.US"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.903, "neg": 0.019, "neu": 0.937, "pos": 0.044}}, {"date": "2023-04-18T19:02:02+00:00", "title": "Dow futures tick lower, Netflix down 0.4% after earnings", "content": "By Oliver Gray\n\nInvesting.com - U.S. stock futures were trading lower during Tuesday's evening deals following a mixed session among major benchmark averages as market participants weighed earnings results from major companies including Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE:GS) and Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC).\n\nBy 6:55pm ET (10:55pm GMT) Dow Jones Futures, S&P 500 Futures and Nasdaq 100 Futures were down 0.1% apiece.\n\nIn extended deals, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) fell 0.4% after the company reported Q1 EPS of $2.88 versus $2.86 expected on revenues of $8.16 billion versus $8.17 expected.\n\nInteractive Brokers (NASDAQ:IBKR) fell 3.7%, reporting Q1 EPS of $1.35 versus $1.40 expected on revenues of $1.06 billion versus $1.03 billion expected.\n\nMetropolitan Bank Holding (NYSE:MCB) popped 14.2% after the company reported Q1 EPS of $2.25 versus $1.94 expected, while revenue came in at $65.5 million versus $66.65 million expected.\n\nWestern Alliance Bancorporation (NYSE:WAL) added 15% after reporting Q1 EPS of $2.30 versus $1.97 expected, with revenue coming in at $551.9 million versus $675.91 expected.\n\nAhead in Wednesday's trade, market participants will be monitoring the Fed's Beige Book as well as a speech from the FOMC's Williams.\n\nAmong reporting companies, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), L\u2019Oreal Co ADR (OTC:LRLCY), Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), Rio Tinto ADR (NYSE:RIO), International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) and KeyCorp (NYSE:KEY) are slated to release quarterly results throughout the session.\n\nDuring Tuesday's regular trade, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the NASDAQ Composite finished little changed, down 10.6 and 4.3 points respectively, while the S&P 500 added 3.6 points or 0.1% to 4,154.93\n\nOn the data front, preliminary building permits and housing starts data both fell from the previous month's reading, while FOMC member Bowman noted that financial conditions appear to have calmed following the collapse of SVB Financial Group (OTC:SIVBQ) and Signature Bank (OTC:SBNY) last month.

The focal point of the electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer\u2019s earnings release will be its vehicle production and deliveries. Stronger-than-expected deliveries during the quarter under discussion are likely to have enhanced results.\r\n\r\n(Also Read: Tesla to Report Q1 Earnings: Is a Beat in Store?)\n\nQ4 Highlights\n\nIn the last reported quarter, Tesla reported earnings of $1.19 per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.09. This marked the eighth straight earnings beat for the company. Higher-than-expected revenues from Energy Generation and Storage and the Services and Other segments resulted in this outperformance. The bottom line also compared favorably with the year-ago earnings of 85 cents a share. Total revenues came in at $24,318 million, surpassing the consensus mark of $23,729 million. The top line, however, witnessed year-over-year growth of 37.2%.\r\n\r\nProduction and delivery totaled 439,701 and 405,278 vehicles, respectively, for fourth-quarter 2022, reflecting a year-over-year jump of 44% and 31%, respectively. Model 3/Y registered production and deliveries of 419,088 and 388,131 vehicles, respectively, marking year-over-year growth of 43% and 31%, respectively. Production and delivery of the Model S/X totaled 20,613 and 17,147 units, respectively.\r\n\r\nTesla had cash/cash equivalents and long-term debt and finance leases of $22,185 million and $1,597 million, respectively, as of Dec 31, 2022. The firm generated a free cash flow of $1,420 million during fourth-quarter 2022, falling 148.8% year over year.\n\nRecord Q1 Deliveries Outpaced Estimates\n\nFirst-quarter deliveries totaled 422,875 units, up 36.4% from the year-ago quarter and 4% from the prior quarter, which also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total vehicle deliveries of 412,884. To counter rising interest rates that have made financing vehicles expensive, Tesla has lately resorted to price cuts on most of its models to spur demand. With the vehicles getting more affordable, the company is witnessing strong orders. These price cuts make its cars more competitive compared with rivals and also make several of its models eligible for the $7,500 tax rebates.\r\n\r\nTesla\u2019s models 3 and Y are the company\u2019s most successful EVs, accounting for most of its sales. For the quarter, Tesla delivered 412,180 of those, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 390,820 units. However, deliveries of models S and X lagged estimates. First-quarter 2023 deliveries of models S and X came in at 10,695 units, below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 18,745 units.\r\n\r\nAs for production, Tesla manufactured 440,808 vehicles (421,371 units of Model 3/Y and 19,437 units of Model S/X). How does that compare with estimates? For the quarter under discussion, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total production was 452,468 units (433,563 Model 3/Y units and 18,906 Model S/X units).\n\nStory continues\n\nOverall Earnings & Revenue Projections for Q1\n\nOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Tesla as it has the right combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\r\n\r\nThe company has an Earnings ESP of +0.19%. Tesla currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter\u2019s earnings is pegged at 85 cents per share, indicating a decline of 20.56% on a year-over-year basis. The consensus mark has remained unchanged in the past seven days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $23.56 billion for sales indicates a 25.62% rise on a year-over-year basis.\n\nOther Stocks With the Favorable Combination\n\nHere are a few more players from the auto space that, according to our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat for the quarter to be reported:\r\n\r\nAutoliv ALV will release first-quarter 2023 results on Apr 21.

Electric car and Chinese customer in store. Polestar is a Swedish automotive brand owned by Volvo Cars and Geely (GGPI)\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nPolestar (NASDAQ:PSNY) is basically Volvo\u2019s electric vehicle arm that trades as an independent stock. Investors must understand that fact makes Polestar fundamentally different from other legacy names now entering the EV space. The EV sales contributions of Ford (NYSE:F) and GM (NYSE:GM) are inseparable from those firms and their stocks.\n\nPolestar\u2019s aren\u2019t. The simple truth is that Polestar benefits from its legacy vehicles that have now become an EV company. Ford and GM EVs are inextricable from their legacy owners as an investment currently.\n\nThat\u2019s one clear advantage of the Polestar brand. Another is that Polestar leverages a very well-respected brand legacy, especially across Europe. The Polestar 2 was the most popular EV in Germany in 2022, beating familiar European names, including Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VWAGY), Dacia, and Tesla.\n\nPolestar sold nearly 10,000 EVs in the U.S. in 2022. That means roughly 20% of the company\u2019s 51,000 vehicle sales were attributable to the U.S. market. It is also targeting the Chinese market with its Polestar 3 SUV priced above $100k. If Polestar can establish a strong sales base there, it\u2019ll be in a prime position with a strong, diversified sales base across the major markets.\n\nStory continues\n\nNio (NIO) NIO logo, sign atop of North American headquarters and global software development center in Silicon Valley. NIO is Chinese electric autonomous vehicles manufacturer\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nNio (NYSE:NIO) stock isn\u2019t in a great position as Tesla again slashes prices. The last time Tesla slashed prices, at the end of 2022, sales jumped by 76% to 12,000 vehicles in a single week. Tesla\u2019s latest reductions apply to the U.S. market. If those same discounts are applied in China, another sales spike could result.\n\nI would expect a few things to happen if that is indeed what happens. Just as at the end of 2022, customers will rush in to buy due to discounted prices, and those who bought prior will seek refunds. The latter issue won\u2019t be honored, just as it wasn\u2019t when buyers complained of feeling cheated by the late 2022 price reductions.\n\nAnd Nio, which is deeply connected to the Chinese state, might see some beneficial treatment. China doesn\u2019t want Tesla to initiate an EV price war in the country, especially as Nio\u2019s losses deepen. As a result, it could incentivize Nio and other Chinese EV manufacturers if Tesla\u2019s price drop is extended to China and drives up demand there.\n\nAlbemarle (ALB) Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com\n\nAlbemarle (NYSE:ALB) stock is alternately a great stock on the notion that the growing EV market benefits it and a sell as lithium prices fall from 2022 highs. In fact, lithium prices have recently crashed below $22,000 per tonne after going hyperbolic in 2022 and reaching $60,000.\n\nBut the truth is more likely somewhere in the middle. Albemarle anticipates continued strong demand for lithium sales measured by volume. It provided guidance for an expected 20-30% compound annual growth rate for lithium volume sales between 2022 and 2027. The company has certainly run various models that consider a range of outcomes, with lithium prices figuring prominently. The point is that Albemarle can\u2019t logically expect prices to remain at 2022 levels indefinitely, and its analytics teams modeled various scenarios.\n\nAlbemarle is riskier than its competitors for the simple fact that it relies on market pricing rather than futures contracts for those lithium sales. That will sting the company immediately, but the price dip could become an opportunity moving forward.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\r\n\r\nThe electric carmaker saw negative earnings estimate revision of a penny over the past 30 days for the to-be-reported quarter. Analysts decreasing estimates right before earnings \u2014 with the most up-to-date information possible \u2014 is not a good indicator for the stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter indicates a substantial year-over-year earnings decline of 20.6% and revenue growth of 25.6%.\r\n\r\nHowever, the earnings track is robust for the company, which delivered a four-quarter average earnings surprise of 23.55%.\r\n\r\nTesla has a top Growth Score of A but belongs to a bottom-ranked Zacks industry (in the bottom 33%). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the average target price is $220.25, with nearly 546% of the analysts giving a Strong Buy or a Buy rating ahead of the company\u2019s earnings.\n\nStory continues\n\nRecord Q1 Deliveries\n\nEarlier this month, Tesla reported record deliveries for the first quarter fueled by higher demand due to big price cuts across the globe. The company slashed prices globally by as much as 20% in January, unleashing a price war. The basic Model Y, which used to sell for $65,990, now costs $54,990.\r\n\r\nThe luxury carmaker delivered 422,875 (412,180 Model 3 and Y and 10,695 Model S and X) cars worldwide in the first quarter. This is up 36% from the year-ago quarter and 4% from the prior quarter. The electric carmaker produced a record 440,808 (421,371 Model 3 and Y, and 19,437 Model S and X) vehicles during the quarter (read: Tesla Rolls Out Record Deliveries in Q1: ETFs in Focus).\n\nETFs to Watch\n\nMeetKevin Pricing Power ETF (PP)\r\n\r\nMeetKevin Pricing Power ETF is an actively managed ETF that seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing primarily in the U.S.-listed equity securities of Innovative Companies that, in Kevin\u2019s view, have more \u201cpricing power\u201d than their peers.

U.S. EV king Tesla TSLA has sparked an EV price war in China that has resulted in massive price cuts by various automakers in the world\u2019s largest car market. It all started in October when Tesla cut the prices of its popular models in China. The discounts were further escalated in January that made locally-produced cars up to 14% less expensive than 2022. In some cases, the prices of cars in China were around 50% cheaper than in the United States and Europe.\n\nTo keep up with the stiff competition, intensified by Tesla\u2019s steep price reductions, rivals were left with little option but to follow the EV behemoth\u2019s footsteps. Not only China-based EV makers like NIO Inc. NIO, XPeng Inc. XPEV and BYD Co Ltd BYD followed suit, legacy automakers including Ford F, Volkswagen and others also joined the EV price war bandwagon.\n\nBYDDY currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). TSLA and XPEV are #3 Ranked (Hold) each, while F and NIO carry a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) currently.\n\nYou can see\u00a0the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nMad Rush to Slash Prices\n\nChina\u2019s EV industry has experienced exponential growth since 2020, with sales doubling last year, in part due to government subsidies. However, with the subsidy program expiring in December 2022, competition has intensified in the EV space. This has resulted in a crowded market, with companies vying to attract buyers. In addition to that, an uncertain macro environment has started to hurt vehicle demand in the world\u2019s biggest car market. China\u2019s car sales dwindled 13% in the three months ending March 2023. While sales of gas-powered ICE vehicles plunged, growth in EV sales also slowed down, per the China Passenger Car Association.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting here traditional automakers are facing the challenge of selling off their older inventory of diesel- and gas-powered vehicles before stricter national emissions standards come into effect in July, which will make it harder to sell these vehicles.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo remain competitive in the market, carmakers are taking drastic measures by not just offering steep discounts but also providing incentives such as giveaways at dealerships after China phased out its nationwide subsidies for EVs at the end of last year.\n\nSo far this year, more than 40 carmakers in China have discounted both electric and gas-powered vehicles. These discounts vary from several hundred dollars for more affordable models to tens of thousands of dollars for higher-end offerings.According to data compiled by China Auto Market, approximately 20% of the available passenger cars witnessed price reductions exceeding 10,000 yuan ($1,500) in the country during the first quarter of 2023.\n\nAutomakers Join Tesla-Fueled Price War\n\nAmid a bleak vehicle demand outlook in China due to economic worries, Tesla cut prices of its models last October, reversing a string of price hikes over the past two years. Prices of Models 3 and Y were cut by around 10% in October. And just in less than three months, TSLA again slashed prices of Models 3 and Y in January 2023 by as much as 13.5%.\n\nTesla's decision to deepen discounts in China for the second time in January came after a drop in December deliveries of its locally produced vehicles, marking the lowest figures in five months. Additionally, the end of Beijing's subsidy program, which played a crucial role in spurring EV sales in China, resulted in Tesla slashing its sticker prices to boost sales and eventually fueling a price war in the country.\n\nTesla\u2019s steep price reductions prompted other automakers to follow suit amid cut-throat competition. China\u2019s EV maker XPengreduced prices for its G3i SUV, P5 sedan, and P7 sedan models by as much as 13% in January. In a statement to InsideEVs, XPeng cited \u201cThe move will increase the competitiveness of our current products, allowing a broader spectrum of users to experience the intelligent features, and creating a more favorable momentum ahead of our new product launches.\u201d\n\nXPeng\u2019s close peer NIO also started offering discounts of up to 100,000 yuan ($14,900) on some models to boost sales. Per local media reports, NIO started slashing prices of the 2022 ES6, ES7 and ES8 in February.\n\nShenzhen-based BYD\u00a0implemented its first major price reduction of 2023 in February. Specifically, the company reduced the price of its 2021 Han EV model by 20,000 RMB in Beijing, while the 2021 Qin EV experienced a price cut of 15,000 RMB. The discount rate for newer models ranges from 6,000 to 8,000 RMB.\n\nLegacy automakers like Ford\u00a0and Volkswagen, BMW AG and Toyota among others also joined the EV price war bandwagon in China. In response to Tesla\u2019s price cuts in October, Ford reduced the prices of the Mustang Mach-E in China by up to 28,000 yuan\u00a0at the end of October.\u00a0 In March, the company again slashed the prices of the model in China by a substantial 40,000 yuan.\n\nIn a bid to attract price-sensitive customers to its offerings, Germany-based carmaker Volkswagen slashed the prices of its ID series EVs in China last month. The carmaker\u2019s two ventures in China, FAW-Volkswagen and SAIC-Volkswagen, offered discounts of up to 20%, or 40,000 yuan on battery-powered sport-utility vehicles (SUVs). Close peer BMW is also offering substantial discounts on its i3 EV, which can result in savings of up to 100,000 yuan. Precisely, the auto biggie is offering 30% discount on its i3's sticker price of 353,900 yuan.\n\nJapan\u2019s top automaker Toyota cut prices of its bZ4X electric SUV in China by 30,000 RMB in February. After the 15% price cut, the Toyota bZ4X starts at 169,800 RMB ($24,660).\n\n\u201cThe severity of this cycle of price cuts is something that I\u2019ve never seen,\u201d said Tu Le, a managing director at the Beijing consultancy Sino Auto Insights.\n\nA Shakeout in the Cards?\n\nThe intense price war by companies to secure market share is causing significant disruption in China\u2019s auto market. The China Association of Automobile Manufactures doesn\u2019t view this price-cutting spree as a long-term fix to ebbing sales and accumulation of inventory. Many industry watchdogs are of the view that this intensifying EV price war that the situation may result in will wipe out financially weaker automakers and/or lead to potential partnerships and consolidations among Tesla's competitors.\n\nIn order to maintain sales volumes, EV makers are feeling the pressure to reduce prices but can they really afford it? Most of the EV upstarts are struggling financially and are not profitable yet. Such price cuts may further clip margins. While some companies may suffer reduced profit margins, others will likely accept greater losses to sustain their sales figures. While big EV makers like Tesla and BYD can afford to get aggressive with price reductions, smaller and not so financially sound rivals may find it difficult to keep up with this price war.\n\nWall Street predicts that the market will experience a \"survival-of-the-fittest\" shakeout, with only a few dominant electric vehicle players remaining, while weaker brands fade away.\n\nWho is Benefitting From This Price War?\n\nIt is not the carmakers who are reaping the benefits of this price war. As Tesla is set to report earnings tomorrow, analysts are expecting the company\u2019s margins to shrink amid price cuts. The price war is taking its toll on even the most resilient of EV makers. Lest we forget, BYD\u00a0suffered an $18 billion wipeout in value in February amid the Tesla-ignited EV price war.\n\nWith near-term prospects of such strong companies getting muted, we can\u2019t expect the relatively smaller EV players to tackle the current scenario well. It is also difficult for legacy automakers like Ford, whose EV business is still not profitable.\n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that the EV price war hasn\u2019t ended yet. In fact, more price cuts by EV makers are expected in China as the competition is even more cut-throat now. Per Fitch Rating, the price war in China's car market is likely to extend into the second quarter and erode profitability along the entire automobile value chain in 2023.\n\nAt this crucial point, if anyone is on the winning side, it\u2019s the consumers. As a potential EV buyer in 2023, it is you who can benefit from the price war in the face of increasing competition among automakers as more EVs enter the market. With the market already featuring a vast selection of brands and more than 150 new electric cars and plug-in hybrids set to be launched in 2023, consumers will be spoilt for choices, and that too at much more affordable sticker prices.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

All three posted better-than-expected results, exceeding both earnings and revenue expectations.\n\nThis week, we have a full slate of quarterly reports, including those from market titans Netflix and Tesla. Below is a chart illustrating the year-to-date performance of both stocks, with the S&P 500 blended in as a benchmark.\n\nAs we can see, both stocks have outperformed the general market in 2023, indicating favorable momentum. Let's take a look at how both stack up heading into their quarterly releases.\n\nNetflix\n\nA central focus point of NFLX's quarterly results is Net Subscriber Additions, telling us if consumers continue to flock to the platform. The company's earnings release is scheduled for Tuesday, April 18th, after market close.\n\nNet Subscriber Adds came in well above expectations in its latest release; Netflix reported Net Subscriber Adds of roughly 7.7 million, handily beating our consensus estimate of 4.5 million by nearly 70%.\n\nIn fact, it represented Netflix's third consecutive quarter of exceeding Net Subscriber Additions expectations, undoubtedly a major positive.\n\nSurprise (%) - Net Subscriber Additions\n\nThe market cheered on the better-than-expected Subscriber Additions, with Netflix shares climbing nearly 9% the following trading session.\n\nNow, for its upcoming release, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Net Subscriber Additions sits at 3.7 million, reflecting a notable improvement to the year-ago quarter when the company lost roughly 200,000 subscribers.\n\nRegarding the bottom line, the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $2.81 indicates a roughly 20% Y/Y pullback within earnings, with the quarterly earnings estimate remaining unchanged over the last 60 days but up 3% since January of this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn addition, Netflix is forecasted to have generated roughly $8.2 billion in revenue throughout the period, implying growth of 4% compared to the year-ago quarter.\n\nTesla\n\nWe're all highly familiar with Tesla, the undisputed leader in EVs. Like Netflix, investors like to focus on an individual metric of Tesla \u2013 the company's EV deliveries. TSLA's earnings release is scheduled for April 19th, after market close.\n\nOn April 2nd, the company unveiled its production and delivery numbers; Tesla produced roughly 441,000 vehicles throughout the quarter, with total EV deliveries tallying approximately 422,800 and growing 36% Y/Y. As usual, the Model 3/Y represented the bulk (about 97%) of the deliveries, totaling 412,000.\n\nThe market didn't particularly react well to the results, with Tesla shares losing 6% in value the following trading day.\n\nCurrently, the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $0.85 indicates a 20% year-over-year pullback within earnings, with the quarterly estimate down 1% over the last 60 days. Price cuts within the company's EVs have undoubtedly impacted analysts' views on Tesla's bottom line.\n\nTesla posted better-than-expected results in its latest release, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by roughly 9% and delivering a 2.5% revenue beat.\n\nBottom Line\n\nWith earnings season kicking into higher gear, investors will have plenty of quarterly results to sort through daily.\n\nAnd soon, we'll hear from Netflix and Tesla. Both companies will reveal their results after market close, with Netflix scheduled for Tuesday, April 18th, whereas Tesla is scheduled for Wednesday, April 19th.\n\nInvestors will be focused on Netflix's subscriber additions, a metric that the company has consistently positively surprised on as of late. Regarding Tesla, investors will get a better view of how price cuts have affected margins.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +6.2 average gain per year.

It Was the Bank\u2019s Undoing One Tesla Deal Propels Little-Known Family to $800 Million Fortune A $300,000 Salary Feels Like $100,000 in The Priciest US Cities\n\nThe 37-year-old Chicago attorney is in the market for a new vehicle and was considering an Ioniq 5 electric SUV. He may end up buying a plug-in hybrid instead for one reason: The Hyundai model didn\u2019t make the just-released list of EVs eligible for up to $7,500 US tax credits.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s not on there, I\u2019m not going to buy it,\u201d Scott said of the Ioniq 5. \u201cBuying a car with a subsidy really kind of shifts my buying power. It allows me to purchase a more expensive car.\u201d\n\nHyundai\u2019s electric model getting snubbed was no surprise. The Inflation Reduction Act that President Joe Biden signed into law in August limited credits to EVs assembled in North America, and the South Korean automaker won\u2019t have a new $5.5 billion Georgia factory up and running until late next year.\n\nBut more consumers like Scott are likely to change their car-buying calculus on account of Biden making credits more elusive starting Tuesday. In addition to needing to build their EVs in North America, car companies must line up supply of battery components and raw materials from the US and its free-trade partners to qualify.\n\nThe stringent content rules are the stick Biden is using to get automakers and their battery suppliers to invest in the US. The carrot \u2014 manufacturing incentives that could render the country the most profitable place in the world to produce battery cells \u2014 is helping make the massive spending necessary an easy sell in board rooms. Companies announced plans for more than $52 billion worth of EV and battery manufacturing projects in the six months after the IRA passed, according to BloombergNEF.\n\nStory continues\n\nBiden\u2019s hands were tied by West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin, who insisted on EV incentives being conditioned upon making the US and its allies less dependent on China for batteries and raw materials. The result of that hardline: Only 10 electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles will be eligible for the full tax credit for now, and seven will qualify for $3,750.\n\nGeneral Motors lays claim to half the EV models in line for the $7,500 incentive for months to come. One of those \u2014 the Chevrolet Bolt \u2014 ended up with a customer earlier this month who\u2019d been wavering over whether to buy a new EV, until the tax credits got her off the fence.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been waffling back and forth,\u201d said Ashley McDonnell, a 33-year-old podcaster in Cinnaminson, New Jersey, who purchased her Bolt the first week of April.

It also introduced a Lexus-brand minivan, the \"Luxury Mover,\" a hybrid designed to be chauffeur driven, a preference for many Chinese luxury car buyers.\n\nBoth Toyota and VW's mass-market brands have lost share in China over the past year as the market shifted to EVs and plug-in hybrids where made-in-China brands, led by BYD , have moved faster.\n\nIn a mark of that reversal, BYD outsold both Toyota and VW brand vehicles in the first quarter of this year in China.\n\nOn Tuesday, BYD launched an entry-level EV, the Seagull, aimed at the small car market that Toyota has long-dominated with models such as the Corolla, a global best-seller.\n\nThe Seagull will start at the equivalent of just over $11,000. By comparison, Toyota's most popular EV on offer in China, the bZ4X, starts at more than $29,000.\n\n\"Amazingly affordable,\" Bill Russo, founder of Automobility, a Shanghai-based consultancy. \"This will be the best-selling car in China within six months of launch.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nThe hatchback-styled Seagull comes with battery options rated at between 305-km and 405-km of range and represents a cheaper alternative to BYD's Dolphin, China's best-selling electric car this year.\n\nCHINA TODAY, TOMORROW THE WORLD\n\nBMW, which plans to launch 11 EV models in China by the end of the year, said it had added features in response to the China market, like the rear-entertainment system in the i7 sedan.\n\n\u201cWhat moves Chinese customers today, moves the world tomorrow,\u201d BMW CEO Oliver Zipse said.\n\nOther Chinese auto executives underlined the pace and pressure to cut costs in a market where electric-drive cars now make up almost a third of new sales.\n\nZhu Jiangmin, chief executive of privately held Leapmotor, offered a bold prediction on how low prices could go, a promising notion for consumers but threatening to automakers.\n\nWithin a decade, he said, he expected China to be able to sell a SUV-styled EV with a battery range of 400 km (249 miles) for around $7,500.\n\nTesla's Model Y, the U.S. EV-maker's top seller globally ahead of its Model 3, is estimated to have a range of 545 km in China but starts at almost $40,000 in the country.\n\nTesla, which has faced some pushback from Chinese consumers and some of its earliest fans for not introducing new models and features faster, opted to skip the Shanghai auto show this year.\n\nThe company reports first-quarter results on Wednesday where the key focus will be how much its discounts in China and other markets cut into its margin.\n\n\"The real situation is that the Model 3 was competitive in 2018, but not so competitive today, and it is normal for them to cut prices,\" Nio founder William Li told reporters. \"You can get better cars for the same price in China.\"\n\nLi estimated Nio and other automakers that manufacture primarily in China had as much as a 20% cost advantage over Tesla because of China's dominance over the supply chain and raw materials for battery-electric cars.

The website of the Nevada secretary of state\u2019s office says the business was formed on March 9 and lists Musk as its director and his longtime adviser, Jared Birchall, as secretary.\n\nMusk has for many years expressed strong opinions about artificial intelligence and has dismissed other tech leaders, including Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates, for having what he has described as a \u201climited\u201d understanding of the field.\n\nMusk was an early investor in OpenAI \u2014 the startup behind ChatGPT \u2014 and co-chaired its board upon its 2015 founding as a nonprofit AI research lab.

U.S. safety regulators last month announced an investigation into a fatal crash involving a Tesla suspected of using an automated driving system when it ran into a parked firetruck in California.\n\nThe firetruck probe is part of a larger investigation by the agency into multiple instances of Teslas using the automaker\u2019s Autopilot system crashing into parked emergency vehicles that are tending to other crashes. NHTSA has become more aggressive in pursuing safety problems with Teslas in the past year, announcing multiple recalls and investigations.\n\nIn the year after Musk resigned from the board, OpenAI was still far away from working on ChatGPT but publicly unveiled the first generation of its GPT system, on which ChatGPT is founded, and began a major shift to incorporate itself as a for-profit business.\n\nBy 2020, Musk was tweeting that \u201cOpenAI should be more open\u201d while noting that he had \u201cno control & only very limited insight\u201d into it.\n\nAt times, he has been complementary.

Reminds Investors That Class Action Lawsuits Have Been Filed Against Catalent, Tesla, DLocal, and Cognyte and Encourages Investors to Contact the Firm", "content": "NEW YORK, April  17, 2023  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, reminds investors that class actions have been commenced on behalf of stockholders of Catalent, Inc. (NYSE: CTLT), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA), DLocal Ltd (NASDAQ: DLO), and Cognyte Software Ltd. (NASDAQ: CGNT). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided.\n\nCatalent, Inc. (NYSE: CTLT)\n\nClass Period: August 30, 2021 - October 31, 2022\n\nLead Plaintiff Deadline: April 25, 2023\n\nThis case is about the rise and fall of a company that initially benefited from the COVID-19 pandemic (also referred to herein as \u201cCOVID-19,\u201d \u201cCOVID,\u201d or the \u201cpandemic\u201d). As a vaccine manufacturer, Catalent was one of the beneficiaries of COVID because it seemed well positioned to capitalize on the rapidly growing demand for vaccine production capacity. Indeed, Catalent almost\u00a0doubled its business during the first year of the pandemic when the bulk of\u00a0vaccines were administered. Catalent\u2019s success during the early stages of the\u00a0pandemic caused its stock price to soar to record highs. By mid-2021, when COVID-related work dropped off, Defendants engaged in accounting and channel stuffing schemes to pad the Company\u2019s revenues. These schemes gave Catalent the appearance of continued growth, causing its stock price to reach new record highs. Meanwhile, to support these schemes and keep pace with its lofty growth targets, Catalent was cutting corners on safety and control procedures at key production facilities. By late 2022, Catalent reported significant sales declines and excess inventory throughout its supply chain. As a result, Catalent stock dropped to pre-COVID levels causing substantial losses to its investors as they learned that Catalent\u2019s early-COVID revenues were never sustainable, and its Class Period revenues were the product of securities fraud.\n\nBy way of background, Catalent is a multinational corporation that manufactures and packages drugs into delivery devices fit for human consumption (i.e., pre-filled syringes, vials, pills, etc.) pursuant to long-term supply contracts with pharmaceutical companies. Catalent directly sells these products to pharmaceutical companies which later sell them through the supply chain to healthcare providers (i.e., hospitals, clinics, etc.), which administer them to\u00a0patients, who are the end consumers.\n\nPrior to the onset of the pandemic, Catalent\u2019s quarterly revenue averaged approximately $669 million between April 2018 and March 2020. During the period that those revenues were reported to the market, Catalent stock had an average closing price of approximately $47.57 per share. In early 2020, Catalent took on numerous large-scale COVID projects, including filling vaccines into syringes for Moderna and AstraZeneca. Those projects catapulted the Company\u2019s quarterly revenues to record highs, which averaged approximately $940 million between April 2020 and March 2021, a 40 percent jump over preCOVID revenues. Over the period when that revenue surge was reported to the market, Catalent stock had an average closing price of $102.42 per share.\n\nBy mid-2021, as the pandemic wore on, demand for Catalent\u2019s COVID products decreased because vaccinations had already been administered to a large number of potential patients. For example, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (\u201cCDC\u201d) data indicates that COVID vaccinations in the United States reached an all-time high of 4.5 million doses on April 1, 2021, and averaged 1.5 million daily doses between December 14, 2020 and August 28, 2021. By comparison, CDC data indicates that average daily vaccinations in the United\u00a0States were under 625,000 during the Class Period.\n\nDespite this marked decline in the demand for COVID vaccines, Catalent continued to report growing revenues and assured investors that customer demand remained strong during the Class Period. The average quarterly revenue reported during the Class Period was $1.2 billion, an 80 percent increase over preCOVID-19 revenues and a 28 percent increase over its reported revenues for the first year of the pandemic. Unbeknownst to investors, Defendants artificially inflated these revenues through fraudulent accounting and channel stuffing schemes to mislead investors into believing that Catalent was generating\r\nsustainable revenue growth. Defendants\u2019 fraud caused Catalent stock to trade at a record high of $142.64 per share on September 9, 2021 and an average closing price of approximately $108.00 per share during the Class Period.\n\nStatements made by Defendants throughout the Class Period were materially false and misleading when made because they misrepresented or failed to disclose the following adverse facts, which were known to Defendants or recklessly disregarded by them:\n\na. Catalent materially overstated its revenue and earnings by prematurely recognizing revenue in violation of U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d);\n\nb. Catalent had material weaknesses in its internal control\u00a0over financial reporting related to revenue recognition;\n\nc. Catalent falsely represented demand for its products while it knowingly sold more product to its direct customers than could be sold to healthcare providers and end consumers;\n\nd. Catalent disregarded regulatory rules at key production facilities in order to rapidly produce excess inventory that was used to pad the Company\u2019s financial results through premature revenue recognition in violation of GAAP and/or stuffing its direct customers with this excess inventory; and\n\ne. As a result of the foregoing, Defendants lacked a reasonable basis for their positive statements about the Company\u2019s financial performance, outlook, and regulatory compliance during the Class Period.\n\nCatalent\u2019s misrepresentations were first revealed to the market on August 29, 2022, when the Company disclosed that demand for its COVID-related products was facing substantial headwinds. On this news, Catalent\u2019s stock price declined by 7.4 percent to close at $92.28 per share on August 29, 2022.\n\nThen, on September 20, 2022, a Washington Post report exposed that the release of COVID-19 vaccines produced by Catalent had been delayed by\u00a0regulators because of improper sterilization at one of Catalent\u2019s key facilities. On\u00a0this news, Catalent\u2019s stock price declined by 9.3 percent over two trading sessions,\u00a0to close at $79.06 per share on September 22, 2022.\n\nOn November 1, 2022, Catalent revealed that its quarterly earnings had declined to zero and lowered its financial guidance, indicating falling demand. The Company also disclosed that regulatory issues at its key facilities were negatively impacting its financial results. On this news, Catalent\u2019s stock price declined by 31.7 percent over two trading sessions, to close at $44.90 per share on November 2, 2022. All told, over the course of the Class period, Catalent stock fell from a high above $142.00 to close at $44.90 on November 2, 2022, a more than 68 percent decline.\n\nOn November 16, 2022, Catalent revealed that it was carrying approximately $400 million in excess inventory, further revealing that the Company had misrepresented demand for its products as well as its purported ability to predict future demand. On this news, Catalent\u2019s stock price declined by 8.5 percent, over two trading sessions, to close at $42.07 per share on November 17, 2022.\n\nThen, on December 8, 2022, GlassHouse Research published a report claiming that Catalent had been materially overstating its revenues by $568.2 million in violation of GAAP. The report detailed numerous red flags that were\u00a0indicative of Catalent\u2019s improper accounting practices. These red flags included\u00a0the rapid increase in Catalent\u2019s contract asset and inventory balances, declining\u00a0customer deposits, executive turnover, and recent scrutiny of the Company\u2019s revenue accounting by regulators. The report also described how Catalent\u2019s direct customers were stuffed with excess inventory which \u201cwill take years to unwind.\u201d On this news, Catalent\u2019s stock price declined 3.6 percent to close at $45.54 per share on December 8, 2022.\n\nAs a result of Defendants\u2019 wrongful acts and omissions, and the precipitous decline in the market value of Catalent securities, Plaintiff and other\u00a0Class members have suffered significant losses and damages.\n\nFor more information on the Catalent class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/LLAP\n\nTesla, Inc.

Since then, the Company has touted refinements and enhancements to the Company\u2019s ADAS and Autopilot features, including so-called \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d (\u201cFSD\u201d) software, which purportedly enables Tesla vehicles to drive autonomously to a destination entered in the car\u2019s navigation system.\n\nThroughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company\u2019s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically,\u00a0Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Defendants\u00a0had significantly overstated the efficacy, viability, and safety of the Company\u2019s Autopilot and\u00a0FSD technologies; (ii) contrary to Defendants\u2019 representations, Tesla\u2019s Autopilot and FSD technologies created a serious risk of accident and injury associated with the operation of Tesla vehicles; (iii) all the foregoing subjected Tesla to an increased risk of regulatory and governmental scrutiny and enforcement action, as well as reputational harm; and (iv) as a result, the Company\u2019s public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.\n\nOn April 18, 2021, media outlets reported that a Tesla vehicle with \u201cno one\u201d driving it had crashed into a tree, killing two passengers near Houston, Texas in a \u201cfiery\u201d crash. A Harris County Precinct constable told local news station KPRC 2 that the investigation showed \u201cno one was driving\u201d the 2019 Tesla vehicle when the accident occurred.\n\nOn this news, Tesla\u2019s stock price fell $25.15 per share, or 3.4%, to close at $714.63 per share on April 19, 2021.\n\nOn August 16, 2021, media outlets reported that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (\u201cNHTSA\u201d) had opened a formal investigation into Tesla\u2019s Autopilot system after a series of collisions with parked emergency vehicles. The scope of the investigation included 765,000 vehicles, or nearly every vehicle that Tesla has sold in the U.S. since the start of the 2014 model year.\n\nOn this news, Tesla\u2019s stock price fell $31.00 per share, or 4.32%, to close at $686.17 per share on August 16, 2021.\n\nOn June 3, 2022, media outlets reported that NHTSA had issued a formal inquiry to Tesla about the Autopilot and FSD features for certain models of its vehicles after receiving complaints from more than 750 owners of the vehicles about sudden and unexpected braking with\u00a0no immediate cause.\n\nOn this news, Tesla\u2019s stock price fell $71.45 per share, or 9.22%, to close at $703.55 per share on June 3, 2022.\n\nOn January 27, 2023, media outlets reported that the SEC was investigating statements made by Tesla and its Chief Executive Officer (\u201cCEO\u201d), Defendant Elon R. Musk (\u201cMusk\u201d), concerning the Autopilot system, including whether Musk made inappropriate forward-looking statements regarding the Autopilot system.\n\nOn this news, Tesla\u2019s stock price fell $11.24 per share, or 6.32%, to close at $166.66 per share on January 30, 2023.\n\nOn February 16, 2023, media outlets reported that NHTSA had ordered a recall of nearly 363,000 Tesla vehicles equipped with the Company\u2019s FSD \u201cBeta\u201d software, stating that the software may allow the equipped vehicles to act \u201cin an unlawful or unpredictable manner,\u201d increasing the risk of a crash.\n\nOn this news, Tesla\u2019s stock price fell $12.20 per share, or 5.69%, to close at $202.04 per share on February 16, 2023.\n\nThen, on February 18, 2023, media outlets reported that a Tesla vehicle had crashed into a fire truck that was responding to an earlier accident, killing the driver and injuring a passenger and four firefighters. News reports linked the crash with prior reports of Tesla vehicles crashing into stationary emergency vehicles as a consequence of poorly performing ADAS technologies, increasing market and public concerns regarding the Autopilot system in Tesla\u2019s vehicles.\n\nOn this news, Tesla\u2019s stock price fell $10.94 per share, or 5.25%, to close at\u00a0$197.37 per share on February 21, 2023, the next trading day.\n\nAs a result of Defendants\u2019 wrongful acts and omissions, and the precipitous decline in the market value of the Company\u2019s common stock, Plaintiff and other Class members have suffered significant losses and damages.\n\nFor more information on the Tesla class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/TSLA\n\nDLocal Ltd (NASDAQ: DLO)\n\nClass Period: In connection with the June 2021 IPO\n\nLead Plaintiff Deadline: May 1, 2023\n\nDLocal, which conducted its IPO in New York and trades on the NASDAQ under the ticker symbol \u201cDLO,\u201d connects global merchants to emerging markets, earning revenues from fees charged to merchants in connection with payment processing services for cross-border and local payment transactions.\n\nIn June 2021, Defendants (defined below) commenced DLocal\u2019s IPO, issuing over 33.8 million shares at $21.00 per share, including the full exercise of the Underwriter Defendants\u2019 (defined herein) option to purchase additional shares, all pursuant to the Registration Statement.\n\nAmong other things, the Registration Statement repeatedly touts DLocal\u2019s supposed \u201cgrowing and deepening relationships\u201d with new and existing global merchant clients. The Registration Statement tells prospective investors that DLocal measures its success by means of its \u201ccohort\u201d performance in terms of TPV, or total payment volume, and offers historic TPV data to support the narrative that DLocal has a strong track record. In addition, the Registration\u00a0Statement advises prospective investors that a remediation plan designed to improve the\u00a0Company\u2019s internal controls over financial reporting is being implemented, assuring the market\u00a0that DLocal is serious about its internal controls over financial reporting.\n\nThe Registration Statement\u2019s numerous representations about DLocal\u2019s TPV and its internal controls over financial reporting, however, contained untrue statements of material fact and omitted to state material facts both required by governing regulations and necessary to make the statements made not misleading. Specifically, the Registration Statement misrepresents the TPV derived from new merchants in DLocal\u2019s 2019 and 2020 cohorts, which, at the time of the IPO, were severely lower than what the Registration Statement reported, as well as the fact that the remediation plan DLocal implemented before the IPO was patently defective and, thus, incapable of improving the Company\u2019s internal controls over financial reporting.\n\nWhen the truth regarding the Company\u2019s TPV and internal controls reached the market, DLocal\u2019s common stock cratered over 50%. All told, investors have lost hundreds of\u00a0millions of dollars.\n\nFor more information on the DLocal class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/DLO\n\nCognyte Software Ltd. (NASDAQ: CGNT)\n\nClass Period: February 2, 2021 - June 28, 2022\n\nLead Plaintiff Deadline: May 1, 2023\n\nOn December 16, 2021, after the market closed, Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, issued a \u201cThreat Report,\u201d which included the results of its \u201cmonths long\u201d investigation into the \u201csurveillance-for-hire industry,\u201d revealing for the first time that Cognyte (along with six private companies) regularly targeted, without their knowledge, journalists, dissidents, critics of authoritarian regimes, families of opposition, and human rights activists around the world, and collected intelligence on these people by manipulating them to reveal information and/or by compromising their devices and accounts, in violation of Facebook\u2019s \u201cmultiple community standards and Terms of Service.\u201d In particular, the Threat Report revealed\u00a0that Cognyte \u201csells access to its platform which enables managing fake accounts across social media platforms including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, and VKontakte (VK), and other websites to social-engineer people and collect data.\u201d This conduct \u201cviolated multiple Community Standards and Terms of Service,\u201d and \u201cgiven the severity of their violations,\u201d Meta disabled Cognyte\u2019s ability to use its platforms (removing about 100 accounts on Facebook and Instagram), shared is findings with security researchers, other platforms, and policymakers, issued Cease and Desist warnings, and alerted the nearly 50,000 individuals (across 100 countries) who were believed to be targeted to help them strengthen the security of their accounts.\n\nOn this news, the price of Cognyte\u2019s common stock fell 5.11%, closing on December 17, 2021, at $18 per share, before declining another 5.5% the next trading day. By December 22, 2021, Cognyte\u2019s stock had fallen to trade at $15 per share, representing a decline of nearly 21%.\n\nThen, on April 5, 2022, Cognyte issued its Annual Report on Form 20-F for the period ended January 31, 2022 (the \u201c2021 Annual Report\u201d), revealing that the Company was forced to modify its solutions in response to the Threat Report, stating in relevant part:\n\nOur solutions capture, fuse and analyze data collected from various sources, including from commercial web sources and social platforms. Such sources and platforms may allege that our solutions and techniques for capturing and collecting data and information from such sources violate their terms of use or other propriety rights of such sources or of their users. In December 2021, Meta Platforms Inc., or Meta, issued a report alleging that certain solutions offered by us that interface with Facebook and Instagram platforms violate their terms of use. Concurrently with the issuance of the foregoing report, Meta announced that it had removed accounts that it claimed were associated with our solutions and requested we cease data collection from its social platforms. In response to Meta\u2019s allegations, we made modifications to certain features of our solutions, which impacted the manner our customers can use these solutions. Any allegations that our solutions and techniques infringe the terms of use or rights of third parties may result in legal claims against us or our customers. These claims may damage our reputation, adversely impact our customer relationships and create liability for us.\n\nOn the same day it published its 2021 Annual Report, Cognyte reported its fourth quarter 2021 financial results, representing the period during which Facebook disrupted and disabled Cognyte\u2019s use of its platforms for purposes of reconnaissance. Cognyte badly missed analyst consensus estimates for non-GAAP earnings per share and sales, and significantly undershot the midpoint of its guidance range by several millions of dollars, citing in the Company\u2019s accompanying press release \u201clower conversions within [its] product pipeline,\u201d among other macroenvironmental challenges. Specifically, the Company\u2019s non-GAAP earnings of $0.16 per share were not only down significantly from the $0.36 per share it earned in the year-ago quarter but also $0.06 per share below analysts\u2019 expectations of $0.22 per share. Similarly, Cognyte\u2019s sales of $124.9 million, representing a less than 1% increase from the year-ago period, also came significantly below analysts\u2019 consensus estimate of $129.6 million.\n\nThe response from analysts was swift with many reducing their price targets, including Wedbush, who lowered their price target from $17 to $9 and concluded: [T]he Cognyte business model is turning into a debacle of [ ] epic proportions for investors that once believed in the story. Since the spin-off from Verint over the past year, the Cognyte story ha[s] been a nightmare for investors as the execution shortfalls, longer sales cycles, and myriad of challenges has created a perfect storm for the Street. Most troubling to us is that CGNT was unable to guide for 1Q23 and 2023, which means to us that management may not have their arms around the sales execution and headwinds in our opinion.\n\nThe market also responded immediately and harshly. Cognyte\u2019s stock price plummeted over 31% on unusually high trading volume, closing at $8.03 per share on April 5, 2022, which was down $3.63 per share from its April 4, 2022 close of $11.66 per share.\n\nThen, on June 28, 2022, Cognyte released its first quarter 2022 financial results, which, once again, badly missed analyst estimates across the board. Cognyte\u2019s 1Q22 revenue of\u00a0$87 million, for example, represented a decline of 25%. Analysts were expecting a decline of 2%.\n\nIn response, analysts immediately downgraded the Company\u2019s rating and reduced their price targets. William Blair, for example, downgraded Cognyte to \u201cmarket perform\u201d and concluded that Cognyte\u2019s \u201clow pipeline conversion\u201d issues were a symptom of a broader problem, stating in relevant part:\n\nCognyte\u2019s brand has been negatively impacted by increased scrutiny of the cyber intelligence industry and fellow Israel cyber surveillance firm NSO Group. Last fall, the U.S. government blacklisted the NSO Group after a multitude of reports surfaced that its software was being used inappropriately by governments to spy on citizens with dissenting views. While we believe there is value to cyber intelligence we believe that it is important for investors and customers that there are rigid safeguards in place and high transparency to ensure that the software is used in an ethical manner.\n\nOn this news, Cognyte\u2019s shares declined $1.84, or over 28.66%, to close at $4.58\u00a0per share.\n\nFor more information on the Cognyte class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/CCNT\n\nAbout Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C.:\n\nBragar Eagel & Squire, P.C. is a nationally recognized law firm with offices in New York, California, and South Carolina.

Shares fell more than 1% today.\n\nInvestingPro users always know first. Start your free 7-day trial to get on board.\n\nThe downgrade was due to the stock\u2019s significant run-up, trading approximately 84% higher year-to-date. According to the firm, The Year of Efficiency re-rating is likely finished, and while cost cuts could help estimates, they're unlikely to impact the multiple significantly.\n\nAdditionally, the firm is concerned about high costs related to AI and Metaverse investments and their potential impact on margins in the mid-to-long term. To become more bullish on Meta, the firm wants to see increased adoption of Advantage+ and other ad tech tools, as well as reduced competition from TikTok.\n\nThe company will report its Q1/23 earnings results on April 26. Consensus estimates stand at $2.02 for EPS and $27.62 billion for revenues.\n\nRivian Automotive downgraded to Neutral as current strategy is 'costly'\n\nPiper Sandler downgraded Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ:RIVN) to Neutral from Overweight on Friday and cut its price target to $15.00 from $63.00, as it believes the company\u2019s strategy is too costly.\n\n\u201cWe still like Rivian's strategy, which uses vertical integration to capture lucrative after-sales revenue (e.g. software, service, and charging). Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is the only other company with so much ambition, and arguably, Tesla's superiority stems from its ability to unilaterally control all aspects of design, production, sales, and service,\u201d said the firm, noting that the problem is that this strategy is costly.\n\nAccording to the firm, in order for Rivian to justify its cost structure, the company must spread its investment over millions of units (just like Tesla does), and in order to finance such aggressive expansion, it will need capital. Specifically, the firm believes over $4 billion will be needed to fund growth beyond 2025.\n\nStory continues\n\nUpstart started with Underweight at JPMorgan, shares down 9% last week\n\nJPMorgan initiated coverage on Upstart Holdings (NASDAQ:UPST) with an Underweight rating and a price target of $11.00, given funding headwinds, its growing on-balance sheet credit exposure, and uncertain near-term origination and profit outlook.\n\nWhile the firm likes the longer-term potential of Upstart's AI Lending platform, it noted that the business is proving to be extremely cyclical and sensitive to the whims of its funding partners.\n\nShares closed nearly 9% lower last week.\n\n3 more downgrades\n\nCiti downgraded Vale (NYSE:VALE) to Neutral from Buy and cut its price target to $16.00 from $20.00 with iron ore about to enter a period of seasonal weakness driven by the China steel mill stocking cycle.\n\nLonger-term, Citi remains positive based on Vale\u2019s strong asset quality and the potential to improve operating performance.\n\nJPMorgan downgraded Wolfspeed (NYSE:WOLF) to Neutral from Overweight and cut its price target to $65.00 from $100.00, given the higher likelihood of negative catalysts in the near term, including challenging improvement in yields on taller boules and throughput from the Durham facility, respectively, and at the same time a more modest ramp in MVF through 2024 even though early revenue still remains on track likely for Q4/23.\n\nTeradyne (NASDAQ:TER) shares closed more than 2% lower today after JPMorgan downgraded the company to Underweight from Neutral and cut its price target to $81.00 from $90.00, noting increasing risks around elevated expectations of a rebound in revenue and earnings starting with the back half of 2023 and in 2024.\n\nThe company will report its Q1/23 earnings results on April 25.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUBS makes changes to buyback programme following Credit Suisse takeover\n\nOnce-dominant foreign auto brands pledge comeback in China", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/6-analyst-cuts-weekly-meta-004358168.html", "symbols": ["FB2A.F", "FB2A.XETRA", "META.US", "RIVN.US", "TER.US", "TEY.F", "TL0.F", "TL0.XETRA", "TSLA.MX", "TSLA.US", "TSLA34.SA", "UPST.US", "VALE.US", "WOLF.US"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.974, "neg": 0.065, "neu": 0.834, "pos": 0.101}}, {"date": "2023-04-18T00:15:47+00:00", "title": "Japanese carmakers\u2019 China sales hit by sluggish EV rollout", "content": "Toyota and other Japanese carmakers are suffering the sharpest sales decline in China among foreign brands as analysts warn that their slow rollout of electric vehicles is threatening their future in the world\u2019s largest auto market.

No change to text.)\n\nSHANGHAI, April 18 (Reuters) - China's auto market, the world\u2019s largest, is accelerating toward an electric future \u2013 leaving established global brands stuck in the slow lane.\n\nWhen auto executives convene in Shanghai for the auto show starting Tuesday, they will return to a sharply different market from the one they left in 2021 when the industry gathered for a limited event under strict COVID-19 controls.\n\nThe biggest change: China-made brands now lead in key segments and their rise has been powered by new electric-drive models that are gaining share at home and overseas.\n\nThe biggest winner has been BYD, which will use the Shanghai show to unveil a new hatchback electric vehicle (EV) for value-seeking buyers and a pricier EV styled as an SUV.\n\nBYD\u2019s sales in China are up almost 69% this year, giving it an 11% share of the overall car market, more than the Volkswagen brand or the Toyota brand, according to an analysis of sales data.\n\n\"The stratification of this market into clear winners and losers is becoming clear,\" Bill Russo, founder of consultancy Automobility said in a note issued on Tuesday. \"And there are very few winners and a whole lot of losers.\"\n\nChina\u2019s passenger car sales were down 13% in the first quarter, data from the China Passenger Car Association show.\n\nBut sales of EVs and plug-in hybrids \u2013 an area where Chinese automakers led by BYD now dominate \u2013 were up 22%. Sales of internal-combustion vehicles were down by an almost equal margin.\n\nThe result has been a double whammy for the likes of Volkswagen, General Motors, Honda and Nissan . Sales are down and so is market share.\n\nMore than 40 auto brands have followed Tesla in cutting prices on EVs since January in a price war that has supported sales of EVs and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), both of which are classed as \u201cnew energy vehicles\u201d in China. It has also cut into industry-wide profitability, analysts say.\n\nStory continues\n\nTHE \u2018FINAL BASTION\u2019 FOR COMBUSTION\n\nFor years, China\u2019s entry-level market for passenger cars was dominated by combustion-engine cars made by global automakers in partnership with Chinese brands.\n\nBut for cars priced between $22,500 and $30,000, this year has been a wipeout for gasoline-only vehicles. Sales were down 20.5% in the first quarter, compared to a 68% gain for EVs and plug in hybrids.\n\nBYD\u2019s Song plug-in hybrid SUV, with a starting price of about $20,000, outsold the Nissan Sylphy, which had been China\u2019s top-selling car for three straight years. BYD\u2019s Dolphin EV, which starts at about $17,000, was ahead of the Volkswagen Passat.\n\nBecause of the cost pressure on EVs from battery materials, the entry-level market is likely to be \u201cthe final bastion\u201d for gasoline-only vehicles in China, Xu Haidong, deputy chief engineer at the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers said.\n\nIn China\u2019s premium market, with prices between about $52,500 and $60,000, electric-drive cars are already the best sellers.\n\nBYD dominates China\u2019s market for plug-in hybrids, cars that have a combustion engine but are capable of being charged and running for shorter distances on electric power.\n\nPlug-ins represent more than half of BYD sales this year, giving the company scale to compete on price across its line-up, analysts say.\n\nTESLA\u2019S \u2018HEART AND LUNGS\u2019\n\nTesla saw a 27% increase in Chinese sales in the first quarter to just over 137,000 of its Model 3 sedans and Model Y crossovers. Tesla also increased share after cutting prices in China by between 6% and almost 14% in January.\n\nThat put starting prices for Teslas in China between $7,500 and about $10,700 lower than current U.S. prices, which have also been discounted.\n\nAnalysts and investors will focus on what that means for margins when Tesla announces first-quarter results on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cGaining further share in the key China market will be the hearts and lungs of the Tesla growth story,\u201d Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said in a note on Monday.\n\nIn a further threat to established brands, China\u2019s exports are growing fast, led by EVs and PHEVs. Industry-wide exports from China were up 83% last quarter from a year earlier.\n\nBYD, which markets its cars in Europe and Southeast Asia, had a 13-fold increase in exports from China.
