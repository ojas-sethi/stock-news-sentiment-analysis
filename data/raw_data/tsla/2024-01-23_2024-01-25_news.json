[{"date": "2024-01-25T23:30:02+00:00", "title": "Why Tesla Stock Plummeted Today", "content": "Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) stock lost ground Thursday following the publication of the company's fourth-quarter earnings results. The electric vehicle (EV) company's share price closed out the daily session down 12.1%, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nTesla's Q4 report arrived with some concerning results for shareholders. The company posted non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings of $0.71 per share on revenue of $25.17 billion in the fourth quarter. The average analyst estimate had called for the company to report adjusted per-share earnings of $0.74 on sales of roughly $25.76 billion.\n\nTesla's growth is slowing\n\nWhile Tesla's revenue grew approximately 3.5% year over year in the fourth quarter, this growth came in significantly below the market's expectations. Performance in the period signals a significant shift in the EV market. While free cash flow (FCF) grew roughly 45% year over year to reach approximately $2.06 billion in the period, future FCF growth won't be so strong unless the company can re-energize its sales momentum.\n\nThe business had posted roughly 9% year-over-year sales growth in Q3 last year, which was already somewhat disappointing. The EV specialist's fourth-quarter results reflect broader headwinds facing the electric vehicle industry. Demand for EVs appears to be weakening, but that doesn't necessarily mean that investors should give up on Tesla. The company has recently implemented substantial price cuts in order to boost vehicle sales, and its pricing power could put pressure on its rivals.\n\nWhat comes next for Tesla?\n\nOver the long term, Tesla could still deliver strong performance. The company is a clear leader in the EV space, and it has multiple ways to win in the category.\n\nEven with recent headwinds dampening its performance, the business continues to post margins that are far above most other players in the automotive industry. Tesla is also an early leader in the robotaxi space, and success in the category could power strong sales and earnings growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company's fourth-quarter results reflect industrywide headwinds. Investors should approach the stock with the understanding that performance could be pressured in the near term, but there's still plenty of long-term growth potential here.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

A closer look suggests a bullish view for Li Auto and a bearish view for Lucid Group.\n\nChina-based Li Auto designs, develops, manufactures, and sells electric SUVs, while U.S.-based Lucid Group manufactures electric luxury sports cars and grand tourers, a type of luxury car designed for long-distance and high-speed driving.\n\nShares of Li Auto have already plunged 25% year-to-date, although they\u2019re still in the green for the past one-year period, up 11%. Meanwhile, Lucid Group stock has plummeted 37% year-to-date and is off 70% over the last 12 months.\n\nThose year-to-date declines in both stocks are the result of an industry-wide plunge in EV makers so far in 2024. Even the mighty Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has tumbled 17% year-to-date following a growing number of headlines that suggest weakening demand for EVs in general.\n\nBetween the news of Tesla\u2019s price cuts and Ford\u2019s decision to cut production of its all-electric F-150 Lightning, EV stocks just can\u2019t catch a break. However, this recent sell-off could offer some buy-the-dip opportunities in the EV space.\n\nIn fact, the sell-off has dragged both Li and Lucid down nearly to oversold territory, with Li\u2019s Relative Strength Index at 30.6 and Lucid\u2019s at 30.8. However, a closer look is needed to determine whether either company is worth picking up on the cheap.\n\nLi Auto (NASDAQ:LI)\n\nLi Auto is a particularly interesting EV play because of how quickly it has scaled and become profitable. Its exposure to China is a key factor in that rapid growth, and the fact that it is one of only a few profitable EV makers there further sets it apart. Thus, a bullish view seems appropriate in light of these factors and the recent sell-off. At current levels, this stock looks far too cheap to ignore.\n\nGoldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) initiated coverage of Li Auto earlier this month with a price target betting on a 50% pop in Li\u2019s stock price. Analyst Tina Hou highlighted the company\u2019s skyrocketing delivery growth and preparations for the launch of a new all-electric model.\n\nStory continues\n\nLi delivered over 50,000 vehicles in December, up 137% year-over-year and achieving its monthly delivery target. During the fourth quarter, the company delivered 131,805 vehicles, a 184.6% year-over-year increase. In all of 2023, Li Auto delivered 376,030 vehicles, bringing its total number of vehicles delivered to over 600,000, the most among emerging new-energy automakers in China.\n\nHou also noted that Li is one of the very few Chinese EV makers that is profitable and highlighted its innovative use of range extenders that utilize a fuel tank to charge the battery and extend the range. Li Auto also plans to launch multiple new vehicles this year, bringing its portfolio to a total of eight models by the end of the year. Thus, there are plenty of upcoming catalysts that could drive further upside this year.\n\nWhat is the Price Target for LI Stock?\n\nLi Auto has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on six Buys, zero Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned over the last three months. At $53.58, the average Li Auto stock price target implies upside potential of 93.4%.\n\nLucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID)\n\nUnlike Li Auto, Lucid Group is not profitable. In fact, at its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 10, Lucid is trading at a steep premium to Li with its P/S of 2.1. Thus, a bearish view looks appropriate for Lucid Group, especially considering that it\u2019s trading at that premium to Li Auto, even though it\u2019s a fraction of the size.\n\nLi Auto has generated US$13.7 billion in sales over the last 12 months compared to Lucid\u2019s $695.8 million in revenue. Lucid delivered 1,734 vehicles during the entire fourth quarter and 6,001 vehicles in all of 2023, so it has a long way to go to catch up to its Chinese competitor.\n\nIn fact, a deeper dive into Lucid\u2019s production and delivery numbers reveals some potential problems. Although its full-year production number of 8,428 vehicles was toward the top of the automaker\u2019s guidance, its original target was to produce 14,000 vehicles in 2023. Lucid cut that original guidance to 10,000 and then lowered it again late in the year to a range of 8,000 to 8,500.\n\nAdditionally, Reuters reported recently that Lucid\u2019s push into Saudi Arabia could be fraught with trouble due to the kingdom\u2019s lack of supply-chain infrastructure for automakers. Saudi Arabia also doesn\u2019t have a workforce skilled in building cars and could face significant problems getting raw materials there. Meanwhile, Li Auto is chugging along in the rapidly growing Chinese market, which is a far better place to be right now.\n\nFurther, this might not be the best time to be trying to scale up while exclusively selling luxury cars, given the possibility of a recession. At the same time, Li Auto has a much wider array of vehicle types and classes, and its price war with Tesla has attracted plenty of press (a.k.a. free advertising).\n\nFinally, after the recent sell-off, Lucid shares are trading around their record low, but there are just too many potential issues to warrant picking up some shares, even at current prices.\n\nWhat is the Price Target for LCID Stock?\n\nLucid Group has a Hold consensus rating based on zero Buys, eight Holds, and one Sell rating assigned over the last three months. At $5.09, the average Lucid Group stock price target implies upside potential of 91.7%.\n\nConclusion: Bullish on LI, Bearish on LCID\n\nComparing Li Auto with Lucid Group is like comparing night and day. Where Li Auto\u2019s delivery and growth trends are positive as its sales continue to jump higher, Lucid is failing to meet its targets. Additionally, Lucid is trading at a much higher P/S multiple than Li, a valuation that simply doesn\u2019t make any sense. Thus, if you were to continually monitor only one emerging EV maker, it probably should be Li Auto.\n\nDisclosure", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/li-vs-lcid-ev-stock-232903516.html", "symbols": ["2015.HK", "GS.US", "L87A.F", "LCID.US", "LI.US", "TSLA.US"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.977, "neg": 0.032, "neu": 0.903, "pos": 0.065}}, {"date": "2024-01-25T22:29:29+00:00", "title": "Dow Jones Futures: Stock Market Rises As Tesla Triggers Bearish Signals; Intel Tumbles Late", "content": "Stocks rose Wednesday, but there are reasons to be wary.

EPS of $0.71 were below analysts\u2019 estimates of $0.74 and Revenue of $25.17 billion missed the mark of $25.76 billion.\n\nWhile neither of those results are egregious misses, the sales results show just a 1% YoY increase. Additionally, management offered concerning guidance saying that volume growth \u201cmay be notably lower.\u201d\n\nBecause Tesla\u2019s premium valuation is based on the expectations of major secular growth in the EV market, seeing this slowdown could be a worrying development.\n\nFurthermore, pressure on growth is only worsened by price cuts on cars, which further compresses margins.\n\nEarnings Estimates and Valuation\n\nIn the chart below, which shows Tesla\u2019s earnings revisions trend, we can see that once 2024 and 2025 estimates began to fall, the stock also started to struggle.\n\nTesla currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating, reflecting mixed earnings estimates. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAdding to the downside risk is the premium valuation Tesla commands. But if the electric vehicle manufacturer can\u2019t maintain the impressive growth rates of past years, it may not be able to boast such a high relative valuation.\n\nTSLA is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 64.4x, which is below its three-year median of 89x, but way above its competitors.\n\nBelow I will share two legacy auto manufacturers that are trading at far more reasonable valuations, and also have much better earnings growth expectations. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAutomaker Alternatives\n\nToyota Motors TM and Honda Motor Co. HMC are two of the largest carmakers in the world, with long histories of success. Both Honda Motor Co and Toyota Motors have Zacks Rank #3(Hold) ratings, indicating mixed earnings revisions, but have other promising catalysts.\n\nStory continues\n\nOver the next 3-5 years Honda Motor Co. is projected to grow EPS by 21.2% annually, while Toyota Motors is expected to grow by 24.6% annually over the same period. Tesla on the other hand is currently forecasting 3\u20135-year EPS growth of 18.8% annually.\n\nBut the most important contrast between the auto companies is the valuations. In addition to better EPS growth forecasts, HMC and TM both have very appealing valuations.\n\nToyota Motors is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 10.3x, just above its 10-year median of 9.8x. However, that gives TM a PEG Ratio of 0.42x, a discounted valuation based on the metric.\n\nHonda Motor Co. valuation is even more appealing on a relative basis. Now trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 7.9x, it is below its 10-year median of 9.1 and has a PEG Ratio of just 0.37x. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nTesla stock likely has a promising long-term future, as Elon Musk has managed to continuously defy the odds, and release truly amazing products. However, because growth is such a critical driver of near-term returns in the stock and struggling, I don\u2019t think the outlook is currently favorable.\n\nI think for now, investors may want to consider avoiding Tesla stock and consider those trading at more appealing levels like Honda Motor Co. and Toyota Motors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The drop, which took $82 billion out of Tesla\u2019s market cap, was the worst single-day performance for shares of Elon Musk\u2019s EV giant since the 21% plunge seen in September 2020\u2014and analysts were quick to criticize management.\n\nWedbush Securities' Dan Ives, a noted Tesla bull, said in a Thursday note that the company\u2019s earnings call left Wall Street with \u201cminimal answers and lots of questions and frustration yet again.\u201d\n\nInvestors were looking for specifics regarding declining margins and the seemingly \u201cnever-ending\u201d string of EV price cuts at Tesla, Ives said, but instead they got a \u201cmore cautious\u201d Musk who was focused on the production of next-gen EVs as well as full-self-driving and AI investments.\n\n\u201cWe were dead wrong expecting Musk and team to step up like adults in the room on the call and give a strategic and financial overview of the ongoing price cuts, margin structure, and fluctuating demand,\u201d Ives wrote. \u201cInstead we got a high level Tesla long term view with another train wreck conference call.\u201d\n\nShaky earnings\n\nTesla\u2019s reported fourth-quarter revenue of $25.17 billion on Wednesday, well below Wall Street\u2019s estimate for $25.64 billion, and an increase of just 3% from a year ago. At the same time, the company\u2019s gross profit margin, which has been investors\u2019 main focus in recent quarters amid repeated EV price cuts, sank to 17.6%, from 23.8% in the same period a year ago. Tack on the outlook for \u201cnotably lower\u201d EV sales growth in 2024 compared to 2023, and it was a \u201cbitter pill to swallow\u201d for Tesla\u2019s stockholders, Ives said.\n\nOn the call, Tesla warned that it is stuck \u201cbetween two major growth phases\u201d as it develops next-gen EVs, full-self-driving tech, and AI and robotics offerings. On that front, Musk said that it was \u201cquite likely\u201d that Tesla\u2019s $25,000 entry-level EV would launch as soon as late 2025, but offered only \u201crelatively superficial comments\u201d about his new humanoid robot, Optimus, and full-self-driving beta testing, according to Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe long-term story\n\nDespite the poor earnings report, Wedbush\u2019s Ives maintained his buy-equivalent \u201coutperform\u201d rating on Tesla shares. He did lower his 12-month price target from $350 to $315, arguing that the potential for more EV price cuts and a lack of concrete margin and sales guidance amount to a \u201ccategory 4 storm\u201d for the company. But overall, he said he believes the long-term growth story at Tesla still remains intact and that mass-market adoption of full-self-driving technology and EVs will eventually boost the company\u2019s earnings.\n\n\u201cOur near-term confidence in the story is shaken, but we remain firm on a long term bull thesis around Tesla and the broader AI story set to take hold. This is a pivotal period for Musk to get Tesla through that will help shape (or haunt) its EV future,\u201d he wrote.\n\nCFRA Research analyst Garret Nelson also remains bullish. Nelson reiterated his \u201cbuy\u201d rating for Tesla on Wednesday, arguing that the production of low-cost, mass-market EV in 2025 \u201ccould be the catalyst the stock needs.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile the bottom-line miss was disappointing and uncharacteristic, as the low-cost U.S. EV producer and with prices appearing to be nearing an inflection point, we see significant earnings leverage for TSLA,\u201d he wrote.\n\nOn the other hand, Tesla\u2019s bears came out firing this week. Gordon Johnson, founder and CEO of GLJ Research, argued in a Thursday note that Tesla\u2019s fourth-quarter numbers show it is just a \u201cstruggling car company,\u201d and not the high-growth AI, robotics, and green energy powerhouse that its supporters see.\n\nJohnson maintained his \u201csell\u201d rating and $23.53 price target for Tesla, which represents 87% potential downside, and argued Musk is nothing but \u201cthe world\u2019s (most successful) sleazy used car salesman.\u201d\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/one-wall-street-biggest-tesla-211336899.html", "symbols": ["TL0.F", "TL0.XETRA", "TSLA.MX", "TSLA.US", "TSLA34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": -0.913, "neg": 0.108, "neu": 0.803, "pos": 0.089}}, {"date": "2024-01-25T21:11:41+00:00", "title": "Tesla Stock Dives 12% As Long-Term Bull Slams 'Train Wreck' Earnings Call", "content": "Tesla tumbled Thursday as analysts offered cautious notes and slashed 2024 estimates after the EV giants weak earnings and gloomy guidance.\n\nContinue reading", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/m/d695381d-7015-3b65-9e30-5096e53da95b/tesla-stock-dives-12%25-as.html", "symbols": ["TL0.F", "TL0.XETRA", "TSLA.MX", "TSLA.US", "TSLA34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": -0.7, "neg": 0.291, "neu": 0.709, "pos": 0}}, {"date": "2024-01-25T21:05:00+00:00", "title": "Ford and GM Get New Buy Ratings, Sort Of.

Tesla reported adjusted EPS of $0.71 against $0.73 expected. Adjusted net income totaled $2.48 billion against the $2.61 billion expected by the Street.\n\nIn terms of its full-year production, Tesla said its \"vehicle volume growth rate may be notably lower than the growth rate achieved in 2023, as our teams work on the launch of the next-generation vehicle at Gigafactory Texas,\" indicating it would not reach Street estimates of 2.19 million for 2024, which would have been a 21% increase from 2023.\n\nTesla stock has lost more than 26% this year.\n\nOn a call with analysts, CEO Elon Musk did confirm that the company's next-gen vehicle will be coming in the second half of 2025. In its earnings release and later on the earnings call, Tesla also mentioned progress on its next-gen manufacturing platform.\n\n\"We are focused on bringing the next-generation platform to market as quickly as we can, with the plan to start production at Gigafactory Texas,\" the company said. \"This platform will revolutionize how vehicles are manufactured.\"\n\n\"We're very far along on our next-gen low-cost vehicle. We're really excited about this. This is a revolutionary manufacturing system, far more advanced than any other in the world,\" Musk said on the earnings call, clarifying that the company's current schedule has this vehicle hitting production in the second half of 2025. This echoes a report from Reuters earlier Wednesday that said Tesla told suppliers it wants to start production of a new mass-market EV codenamed \"Redwood\" in mid-2025.\n\nTesla's drop in profitability is likely due to downward pressure on margins since Tesla began its cost-cutting efforts late in 2022. Tesla reported a Q4 gross margin of 17.6% vs. 18.1% estimated, a big drop compared to a year ago and a sequential decline from the 17.9% achieved in Q3.\n\nStory continues\n\nHeadlines like rental car firm Hertz shedding thousands of EVs, Tesla cutting prices in China, a two-week production halt in Berlin, and CEO Elon Musk's ill-timed demand for more stock have also weighed on Tesla.\n\nEarlier this month, Tesla reported 484,507 deliveries in Q4, beating Street estimates of 483,173, per Bloomberg. That figure represents an all-time record quarter for Tesla, nearly 20,000 units higher than its past record quarter of 466,000 units delivered in Q2 of last year.\n\nFor the year, Tesla said that vehicle deliveries grew 38% year over year to 1.81 million and production grew 35% year over year to 1.85 million. While its 38% delivery growth rate was below its 50% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) target, Tesla previously said it would not attain that goal due to factory shutdowns and improvements that occurred in Q3.\n\nAlso of note are Cybertruck deliveries. Tesla did not break out this total in its Q4 delivery update, though the company did say the Cybertruck production ramp would take longer than other models.\n\n\"[Cybertruck] demand is off the hook,\" Musk said on the call, repeating similar comments that made last year.

(Mike Blake/REUTERS/File Photo) (Reuters / Reuters)\n\nMusk also addressed his comments from last week, claiming that he would need to secure greater control of Tesla if the company is going to meet its wide-reaching AI ambitions.\n\nMusk said on the earnings call that his concern would be, given his current shareholding, that he will have \"so little influence\" in the future that some major shareholder could strip away his control or make a bad decision.

Small-cap healthcare stocks tend to be nimbler and more innovative than their blue-chip counterparts (with some exceptions), meaning they\u2019re better equipped to navigate tricky market conditions and changing industry trends.\n\nAt the same time, many of the best small-cap healthcare stocks capitalize, in one way or another, on global trends that sent stocks like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) soaring. Innovations within small-cap healthcare stocks include advanced AI, machine learning, automation, alternative transportation, and more. What sets these small-cap healthcare stocks apart from megaliths like Nvidia or Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), of course, is their relative cheapness \u2013 and their potential to skyrocket and join the ranks of the biggest stocks driving tomorrow\u2019s market.\n\nClearPoint Neuro (CLPT) Nurse holding a tablet with icons representing different aspects of healthcare and healthcare data representing CANO stock.\n\nSource: metamorworks / Shutterstock\n\nClearPoint Neuro (NASDAQ:CLPT) is on a winning streak this month, making it one of the best-performing small-cap healthcare stocks you\u2019ve never heard of. CLPT\u2019s flagship product is its ClearPoint platform, which helps surgical providers better navigate the brain and associated systems when diagnosing and treating neurological disorders. So what\u2019s sending ClearPoint\u2019s shares surging nearly 15% since Jan. 1? Rapid-fire regulatory approvals across market domains entrench ClearPoint as the \u201cnext big thing\u201d in medical device manufacturers.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe first and most impactful approval was the FDA\u2019s nod towards clinical usage of ClearPoint\u2019s SmartFrame OR Stereotactic System. This platform helps providers better navigate directed radiation therapy during stereotactic radiosurgery. This non-invasive surgery is a radiological alternative to slicing patients open and, instead, beams radiation toward cancerous areas to damage the cancer cells and shrink tumors.\n\nStory continues\n\nCritically, the platform leverages ClearPoint\u2019s tech within the operating room rather than restricting it to an MRI facility, as past tech demanded. President and CEO Joe Burnett summarized the bullish benefits well:\n\n\u201cMore than 95% of all stereotactic neuro-navigation procedures take place in the OR [and] this product is the first in ClearPoint\u2019s history that does not require the use of MRI during the procedure, allowing us to access more hospitals, and to support an order of magnitude more patients than our legacy portfolio.\u201d\n\nClearPoint also secured approval from European Union regulators to ship existing products to the continent this month, further expanding its footprint and increasing its total addressable market.\n\nTransMedics Group (TMDX) stethoscope on a stock chart representing healthcare stocks to buy. Healthcare Stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nTransMedics Group (NASDAQ:TMDX) leads small-cap healthcare stocks as the only FDA-approved platform for lung, heart, and liver transports. This sets it apart operationally, of course, but also helps the healthcare industry address major issues within its organ donor infrastructure.\n\nIn 2022, about 15,000 organ and tissue donors died, but the total donor organ utilization rate was a fraction of the total available. For instance, of the 14,905 viable lungs available in 2022, providers successfully transplanted just 2,692. The delta between available organs and those transplanted is primarily due to difficulties in safe transport and tissue maintenance, a challenge TMDX effectively addresses.\n\nTo that end, the sales of this small-cap healthcare stock are skyrocketing, showcasing its long-term potential. The company\u2019s third-quarter revenue increased by 26% to $66.4 million and marked seven consecutive quarters of revenue growth. We\u2019ll have to wait until Feb. 20 to see TMDX\u2019s end-of-year report, but if 2022\u2019s 200% revenue jump compared to 2021 is any indication, we should expect big things from this small-cap healthcare stock.\n\nHims & Hers Health (HIMS) The logo for Hims & Hers (HIMS) displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Lori Butcher / Shutterstock.com\n\nHims & Hers Health (NYSE:HIMS) is a small-cap healthcare stock that\u2019s tapped into the expanding telehealth trend that, while obvious in retrospect, was innovative at its inception. The company specializes in providing healthcare services considered \u201cembarrassing,\u201d such as sexual wellness and hair loss treatment, remotely and conveniently. This approach bypasses the discomfort and inconvenience of in-person care. HIMS expanded its services to include therapy post-pandemic, creating a self-contained ecosystem that retains customers on its platform.\n\nBut, serving a long-term strategy, HIMS recently partnered with Hartford HealthCare to offer in-person referrals for conditions like heart health and weight loss. Though seemingly contrary to the telehealth model, this decision aims to bolster the company\u2019s stability. By incorporating in-person referrals, HIMS expands its service range for existing patients and eases the management of elective healthcare needs.\n\nThis approach mirrors its expansion into mental health treatment, further developing a comprehensive, closed-loop ecosystem. Moreover, HIMS is poised to gain from Hartford providers who may recommend HIMS for specialized patient needs. While the synergy only benefits Connecticut users and patients for now, successful implementation today could mean a national pivot tomorrow for this small-cap healthcare stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

Still, some have accused BYD and other Chinese car companies of anticompetitive behavior.\n\nThe Biden administration has explored raising tariffs on Chinese EVs as the country continues to dominate the sector. Chinese electric vehicles are already subject to a 25% tariff in the U.S.\n\nInvestigators from the European Commission also plan to visit several Chinese automakers over the coming weeks as the European Union decides whether to raise tariffs on Chinese companies to protect European carmakers. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in September accused Chinese automakers of benefiting from large state subsidies that keep their prices \u201cartificially low.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cThis is distorting our market,\u201d she added.\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla is in the process of launching its own lower-cost model that could allow it to compete in a distinct category from that of its higher-price-tag vehicles. Musk said on Wednesday\u2019s earnings call that production will begin on Tesla\u2019s \u201cnext-generation\u201d $25,000 electric vehicle in mid-2025.\n\nIt is still unclear whether Tesla\u2019s success in the more expensive EV category will translate to the lower-cost EV sector, which is largely dominated by Chinese companies. Still, in terms of licensing and partnering, Musk said Wednesday that Tesla is willing to play nice with Chinese companies\u2014for a price.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re also happy to license for self-driving, perhaps license other technologies and anything that could be helpful in advancing the sustainable energy revolution,\u201d he said.\n\nTesla\u2019s drop almost equal to GM and Ford\u2019s entire value\n\nThe $82 billion decline in Tesla\u2019s market value as of midafternoon on Thursday nearly exceeds the entire valuations of both GM ($48 billion) and Ford ($45 billion), and equals around one-third that of Toyota ($270 billion). Since Tesla now confirms it won\u2019t come anywhere near meeting its own, or Wall Street\u2019s, expectations for either volume or margin growth in the next couple of years, the big question for investors is whether the stock\u2019s newly discounted price accurately reflects the new, downsized expectations. The bulls will argue that at these prices, Tesla\u2019s stock is still a good deal.\n\nThe numbers, however, are daunting. Though Tesla\u2019s stock price is falling, so too are its earnings, meaning that its price-to-earnings multiple remains towering. In Q4, Tesla\u2019s pretax income, excluding regulatory credits, was roughly $2 billion (after adjusting to a normalized tax rate and excluding a big one-time tax benefit). Its net earnings have fallen rapidly in past quarters, going from $3.9 billion in Q4 of last year to $2.4 billion in Q3 before sliding once again.\n\nA steep climb for its stock to recover\n\nSince Tesla presented virtually no positives on the call, let\u2019s assume that its net income is now running at the current clip of $2 billion a quarter or $8 billion a year. That puts its price-to-earnings ratio at 72. How fast must Tesla\u2019s profits wax to grow into that still astounding valuation?\n\nFor investors to pocket a 10% annual gain over the next seven years, Tesla\u2019s market cap would need to reach $1.2 trillion by early 2031. If we assume its P/E will decline to a still formidable 30, the EV giant will need to post GAAP net earnings of $40 billion. That\u2019s almost half of what Apple makes now, 60% of Alphabet\u2019s current profits, and twice what Toyota\u2019s averaged over the past three years.\n\nThe chances of getting anywhere near a double-digit return gets even dimmer if Musk gets his way, and the Tesla board awards him an extra 12% or 13% of Tesla equity to entice the maverick to develop an AI juggernaut for the automaker. Musk wants the shares for free as a reward for his additional services. Unlike any other stock offering, this one wouldn\u2019t put cash for investment in Tesla\u2019s war chest. Put simply, the move would dilute current shareholders so that instead of owning 88% of Tesla, they own 76% or 77%. Hence, their share of the hypothetical, probably mythological $1.2 trillion valuation would go from $1.05 trillion to $920 billion, cutting their return from 10% to 8.8%.\n\nThe last thing Tesla investors need is for Musk to raise the bar on garnering decent gains on his stock. Even the Tesla bulls must be questioning whether Elon himself sees where his stock is headed, and wants to get a lot more for free to cushion the blow.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/elon-musk-warning-market-takes-201045134.html", "symbols": ["TL0.F", "TL0.XETRA", "TSLA.MX", "TSLA.US", "TSLA34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.991, "neg": 0.047, "neu": 0.867, "pos": 0.086}}, {"date": "2024-01-25T19:30:23+00:00", "title": "Tesla Drags Nasdaq Into Negative Territory", "content": "The Nasdaq Composite was under pressure Thursday after a selloff in Tesla stock.

For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article 5 Stocks That Will Outperform the S&P 500 in 2024.\n\nAll indicators show that the US economy remains resilient and in a much better shape than expected, defying all recession worries. The latest report on economic growth released by the Commerce Department shows the US economy grew 3.1% on a year-over year basis in the fourth quarter of 2023 as consumer spending on healthcare, dining out and cars remained strong. Holiday season sales also came in better than expected. Holiday sales during November and December touched a whopping $964.4 billion, not adjusting for inflation, according to data from the National Retail Federation.\n\nThe US economy's strengths and the possibility of rate cuts later this year are causing market bulls to make more ambitious predictions and set new targets for the S&P 500. For example, Katie Stockon, Fairlead Strategies founder and managing partner, said during a program on CNBC earlier this month that the S&P 500 could reach 6,100 in the long term if we see new highs. The analyst said the market is showing signs of strengths despite some stocks being overbought and all of this points to the start of a bull market.

(NYSE:TGLS) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cTecnoglass Inc. (NYSE:TGLS) is a vertically integrated manufacturer, supplier, and installer of architectural glass, framing systems, windows, and doors. The company\u2019s automated manufacturing base in Colombia allows it to manufacture products at a much lower cost than domestic companies. Shipping expenses are a low-single digit percentage of revenues because Tecnoglass transports products to the United States in containers that would otherwise return empty (there is a significant trade imbalance between the US and Colombia).\n\nThe company has a reputation for quality. Its entry-level windows are made of tempered glass (compared to more fragile annealed glass of competitors) and its framing systems are coated with a resin-based coating that performs better (resistance to fade/scratches) than the powder coat coating of peers. The company initially took market share by pricing below competitors, but as its reputation for quality and dealer network has grown the company has been able to increase prices and currently prices at or near market rates\u2026\u201d (Click here to read the full text)\n\n12.

Redditors like Pfizer Inc's (NYSE:PFE) $43 billion acquisition of Seagen.\n\n\"..They are shifting their game to the cancer arena as covid ha(s) died down, also a few obesity drugs in the pipeline, PFE is a undervalued buy for sure,\" said a Reddit comment.\n\nSmead Value Fund made the following comment about Pfizer Inc.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 81\n\nRedditors are deeply divided when it comes to Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA). While a huge number of posts and comments on Reddit say Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) will outperform the S&P 500 in 2024, many also believe the stock will have a tough time amid competition.\n\nA Redditor who is bullish on Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) for 2024 said the following about the stock:\n\n\"I believe it\u2019s a trillion dollar company at the minimum with just the EV\u2019s, so roughly 330$ share price. I also believe 2024 is the year we see energy revenue explode.

(NASDAQ:TSLA) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cTesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) ($248.48 \u2013 up 101.7% for the year. Recent high $299.29): Tesla has significant and underappreciated competitive advantages across multiple verticals including electric vehicles, software and energy storage. Misunderstood by much of Wall Street \u2013 and consequently a favorite of short sellers \u2013 Tesla continues to grow rapidly and increase its lead over the competition while delighting consumers in the process. Despite his unconventional (and sometimes off-putting) personality, Elon Musk is a visionary who has created enormous shareholder value. Musk is also a long-term thinker who has embraced the scale-economies-shared business model favored by Henry Ford and Jeff Bezos, intentionally reducing prices, increasing the customer value proposition and expanding the total addressable market. Tesla\u2019s massive scale and cost advantages are now challenging the viability of legacy auto, which has hundreds of billions of dollars of outdated property, plant and equipment in a world that is rapidly transitioning to electric vehicles (EVs). While we expect competition for EVs to intensify and for Tesla to lose market share over time, we also believe the company will increase production and deliveries from approximately 1.8 million vehicles today to approximately 15 million vehicles in 2030 and further its lead in autonomous driving capability. In fact, we expect Tesla will eventually license its autonomous driving software, creating high-margin (70-80%), recurring licensing revenue. Tesla is also one of only two companies that dominate the energy storage market, which has the potential to grow to several hundred billion in revenue as power plants around the world increase their focus on renewable energy. Our investment in Tesla is aligned with our preference for companies that have strong balance sheets and the managerial skill to reinvest capital at high rates of return into large addressable markets.\u201d\n\n7. Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 89\n\nWalt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS)\u00a0has been facing tough times over the past few months amid growth concerns and strong competition. But a lot of investors on Reddit believe the stock could rebound in 2024.\n\nHere's what a Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS)\u00a0bull on a Reddit discussion thread said about Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS):\n\n\"Governors come and go (reference: DeSantis vs Disney spat). Disney owns half of Hollywood and still has the absolute best amusement parks in the world, even if Universal is catching up. With only Deadpool being released next year, it sounds like maybe they've finally learned their lesson to slow down. They should have stretched phase 4 and 5 out way more. But now they will hopefully stretch phase 6 out (or wherever we are). I predict an overhaul and a massive spike in a few years.\"\n\nMadison Sustainable Equity Fund made the following comment about The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cDuring the quarter, we sold our positions in Bristol-Myers Squibb and\u00a0The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS).\u00a0 The Walt Disney Company is facing a difficult and uncertain transition in its core media business assets including the ESPN business and other linear media assets. These media assets are cash generative but face secular decline as consumers are cutting their expensive cable subscriptions and moving to alternative streaming options. This has resulted in a decline in operating profits for the media division. The media business has long-term fixed costs related to its sports broadcasting agreement with multiple sports leagues which will further pressure profits during this transition.\u201d\n\n6. Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. (NYSE:TSM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 107\n\nRetail investors on Reddit believe Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. (NYSE:TSM) will outperform the S&P 500 in 2024. Many Redditors said in latest discussion threads that the market is not appreciating the AI potential of Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. (NYSE:TSM) due to geopolitical risks. Redditors believe China would not risk a conflict when its economy is going through a crisis. Redditors also like Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd.'s (NYSE:TSM) expansion in Arizona, Germany, and Japan.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 107 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. (NYSE:TSM). The biggest stakeholder of Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. (NYSE:TSM)\u00a0was Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management which owns a $2.6 billion stake in Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. (NYSE:TSM).\n\nWedgewood Partners stated the following regarding Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) was also a top contributor to performance. The Company began shipping chips that were fabricated using its industry-leading \u201cN3\u2033 node. Nearly all of the Company\u2019s N3 capacity has been filled by high-end chip designers such as Apple, NVIDIA and even Intel. As high-performance computing, particularly related to AI in both data centers and edge devices, continues to build momentum, the Company will be a key supplier for many years to come. Despite the boom-and-bust cycle in demand seen for many semiconductors during Covid-19 and post-Covid-19, the Company should be able to post solid double-digit growth next year as inventories and end-market demand across most of its technology nodes get back to normal levels. The Company also maintains dominant market share in leading-edge nodes, which is in short supply, given the difficulties its competitors have had in scaling up EUV-based manufacturing. The Company has been able to secure higher prices because of this and can still generate excellent returns on elevated capital expenditures necessary for this scarce capacity. The Company is arguably one of a handful of the world\u2019s most important and largest companies, but because the Company\u2019s shares trade as an ADR (American Depositary Receipt) the shares are not part of the major stock market indices in the U.S. As a result, the shares are woefully under owned by U.S. investors (institutional and individual), particularly for a company that regularly generates cash flow return on invested capital in excess of +40%. Therefore, our growing position in these shares represent a significantly relatively overweight portfolio position versus our peers and benchmarks. We could not be more pleased by this anachronistic institutional imperative.\u201d\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 Stocks That Will Outperform the S&P 500 in 2024.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n13 Stocks That Outperform the S&P 500 Every Year for the Last 5 Years 10 Stocks with 50% Upside Potential According to Analysts 12 Extreme Dividend Stocks With Upside Potential\n\nDisclosure.

With the world\u2019s richest man at the helm (Elon Musk), Tesla has gone from an obscure start-up to the EV king. Tesla has transformed the EV space like Amazon (AMZN), changed the retail landscape, and Netflix (NFLX) revolutionized entertainment. In fact, roughly 70% of battery-powered electric car sales in the United States are courtesy of Tesla. However, for four straight quarters, TSLA stock has plummeted after reporting earnings, and the stock is more than 50% off its all-time high of $414.50, which was achieved in 2021. Is it time to give up on Tesla, or is the most recent dip an opportunity for bargain hunters?\n\nHistorical Data Tells us that Crisis Equates to Opportunity\n\nJason Goepfert (@jasongoepfert on X) ran historical price data on Tesla and made a significant discovery: \u201cEvery time Tesla gapped down 5% or more to a 6-month low, it rebounded strongly over the next 30 days. 100%-win rate, 18% (!) median return.\u201d Thursday, Tesla gapped down more than 5% to 6-month lows. Will history repeat?\n\nValuation is at Rock-Bottom Lows\n\nTesla\u2019s price-to-book ratio of 12.19 (calculated by taking total assets \u2013 liabilities, preferred stock, and intangible assets) is at its lowest level since early 2020. The last time TSLA\u2019s p/b was this low, TSLA exploded from $35 to more than $400 per share. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nCompetition is Fading\n\nPure-EV competitors to Tesla are collapsing. For example, Nio (NIO),Rivian (RIVN), and Lucid (LCID) are more than 90% off their all-time highs.\n\nChina Stimulus\n\nEarlier this week, news broke that China is planning to unveil a massive stimulus package to boost the country\u2019s struggling economy. In addition, the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) will allow banks to hold smaller cash reserves. Should the stimulus effort be successful, it will be a big boost for Tesla, whose second-largest market is China.\n\nRecord Cash on Hand\n\nStory continues\n\nTesla is turning into a cash cow with nearly $30 billion cash on hand. With so much dry powder, Tesla\u2019s board has the flexibility to buy back shares of TSLA or inject more cash into the business to ramp up production. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nAs Tesla faces a stock decline for four consecutive quarters, recent data suggests a potential opportunity for investors. Historical analysis reveals that every time Tesla experienced a 5% or more gap down to a 6-month low, shares roared back in the next 30 days. Finally, an attractive valuation and cash hoard bode well for the EV king.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Others, however, have not.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), for example, continues to flounder amid weak box office numbers and poor financial results. That\u2019s not just bears saying it, either.\n\nIn fact, AMC CEO Adam Aron wrote on X, the social platform formerly known as Twitter, that: \u201cSo painful: 4 years after Covid the industrywide box office is still ludicrously anemic.\u201d Several factors were at work here, including inflation, the lackluster quality of new movie releases and the continuing rise of streaming as a share of the total marketplace.\n\nIn any case, AMC stock keeps plumbing new lows as the reality of its financial situation sets in. There is a reason AMC has engaged in financial maneuvering to issue more stock and raise capital; the business simply isn\u2019t making money. Indeed, analysts expect the company to lose money again in both 2024 and 2025. All the meme stock energy in the world can\u2019t change the fact that movie theaters appear to be a declining industry, and AMC\u2019s balance sheet is in tatters.\n\nNio (NIO) NIO logo on the smartphone screen and the chart of stock market at the blurred background.\n\nSource: JOCA_PH / Shutterstock.com\n\nAround five years ago, Nio (NYSE:NIO) was a hot EV startup aiming to dethrone Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) in the upscale segment of the vehicle market. NIO stock enjoyed a tremendous run at one point as investors liked the looks of both Nio\u2019s vehicles and business plan.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlas, things failed to come together. Nio was unable to make much of its purported first-moved advantage. The Chinese EV market is now flooded with all manner of competition. And the industry saw its fortunes plummet in 2023 amid a weak local Chinese economy.\n\nTesla just reported lackluster earnings this week. And other EV makers are following suit. Nio, with its large operating losses and struggling business model, does not appear to be one of the long-term winners in this industry.\n\nNIO stock may have seemed like a great idea many years ago, but its time has long since passed. Incredibly enough, Nio lost $664 million from operations last quarter alone. At this rate, Nio investors should question whether the company can stay in business long enough to even try to turn things around.\n\nPeloton Interactive (PTON) Peloton (PTON stock) sign on city storefront\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nBack in 2020, Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON) seemed like a surefire winner.\n\nThe smart fitness company was made for the moment. People were stuck at home. With gyms closed down for the pandemic, Peloton\u2019s bikes and engaging virtual classes were a great exercise option.\n\nHowever, Peloton sought to expand way too quickly, going into other products, such as treadmills, that didn\u2019t garner the same level of customer excitement. Then, as the world started to reopen, the Peloton trend lost steam, and the business\u2019 metrics went into reverse.\n\nThe company\u2019s revenues peaked at $4.0 billion in fiscal year 2021. Analysts expect it to generate less than $2.8 billion this year. Meanwhile, Peloton is running large operating losses and the balance sheet is worsening. It seems only a matter of time until PTON shares slide deep into penny stock territory.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Bezek did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Currently down almost 11% on the day after the company warned of slower growth in its latest quarterly results. And I'm really interested in Elon Musk's comments on Chinese competition. Let's listen to what he said.\n\nELON MUSK: The Chinese car companies are the most competitive car companies in the world. Frankly, I think if there are not trade barriers established, they will pretty much demolish most other car companies in the world.\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: So when he's talking about competition from some of these Chinese cars, essentially though, what he's talking about is some of these cheaper priced models, and also a range of cars as well, something that he had the opportunity to do. He had the opportunity to come up with a cheaper car.\n\nWe're now seeing that potentially coming out in 2025 with this Redwood model. But this was really his crown to lose at this point. And he's actually very lucky at this point that there are those trade barriers that don't allow Chinese EVs to flood the US, as we're seeing that competition in the EU.\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, in many ways, Tesla has had what some would argue a first mover advantage for so long, right, in terms of having that brand as we've seen this shift to EVs. But now we're talking about this second phase, if you will, in the transition. And to your point, the Chinese makers really, really giving Tesla a run for its money.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd the question here is when they start to expand beyond their home market of China, how does Tesla go head to head, especially with that pricing? Yesterday, we were talking about that. $25,000 car that Tesla is potentially looking into moving forward here, because that cycle of Model Y's and Model 3's-- Elon Musk essentially said yesterday, things are starting to stall out on that front.\n\nWhat I think is kind of interesting is looking at Tesla's stock move. We have seen it just get battered on the back of those results yesterday after hours. Today, extending those losses, down about 10.7%. And Rachelle, the question-- this has been the ongoing question for Tesla. Is it a car company? Is it a tech play?\n\nAnd to me, what's interesting is so many analysts that have come out, before any of the earnings calls, to say this is a tech company. This is an AI robotics company. And yet when you look at this reaction today, it clearly still, in a significant way, trades on the car side of things.\n\nBecause AI robotics side simply isn't there. The product isn't there. Elon Musk has all but admitted they are not leading on that. So then what happens to the price of the stock? I mean, today, it is a direct reaction. But you have to wonder long term here what that looks like.\n\nAdam Jonas put out a note initially before the earnings call, which I thought was kind of interesting, breaking down what he thinks is sort of the price, the value of this stock. At $345 a share, which is where he thinks it should be, he thinks Tesla share is worth only $75 comes from selling electric vehicles.\n\nSo a bit of a surprising move, you could argue, if that's the breakdown. I mean, not everybody in the market believes that. But this is still moving on the auto side because the AI and robotics bet is still ways ahead.\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: No, I mean, and you raise a good point that-- I did think it was interesting in that same note from Jonas, he said that he didn't think that the Tesla-- that 4Q earnings result and the earnings call didn't move the narrative in either direction. But it was the fact that he didn't-- we didn't hear much about anything to alleviate the bearishness, so it's sort of letting that narrative run, continues to fuel this potential negativity.\n\nWe're already seeing a slowdown in the EV space. So if you wanted to hear some good news, obviously, that's not what Musk does. He's going to tell it how it is. But that's clearly not what investors were looking for, especially as they see him continue to be distracted by making X the everything app. They really did want to see some signs of growth here and really not getting it.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/video/tesla-stock-headed-correction-growth-165725415.html", "symbols": ["TL0.F", "TL0.XETRA", "TSLA.MX", "TSLA.US", "TSLA34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.989, "neg": 0.034, "neu": 0.881, "pos": 0.085}}, {"date": "2024-01-25T16:32:41+00:00", "title": "Tesla Stock Dives As Long-Term Bull Slams 'Train Wreck' Earnings Call", "content": "Tesla tumbled Thursday as analysts offered cautious notes and slashed 2024 estimates after the EV giants weak earnings and gloomy guidance.\n\nContinue reading", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/m/d695381d-7015-3b65-9e30-5096e53da95b/tesla-stock-dives-as.html", "symbols": ["TL0.F", "TL0.XETRA", "TSLA.MX", "TSLA.US", "TSLA34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": -0.7, "neg": 0.291, "neu": 0.709, "pos": 0}}, {"date": "2024-01-25T16:23:06+00:00", "title": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk says he wants 'strong influence but not control' in push for new share class", "content": "If Tesla (TSLA) becomes a juggernaut in AI as CEO Elon Musk envisions, the risk of activist shareholders taking control of the company and steering it in the wrong direction are too great, he contends.\n\nIn his latest push for greater influence over company decisions, Musk reiterated during an earnings call on Wednesday his support for creating a new class of super-voting shares that would allow him to be \"an effective steward of very powerful technology.\"\n\nMusk said that activists at major shareholder advisory companies could eventually oust him or take Tesla down the wrong path unless he wields more sway through voting influence.\n\nWe were dead wrong expecting Musk and team to step up like adults in the room and give a strategic and financial overview of the ongoing price cuts, margin structure, and flucuating demand..INSTEAD we got a high level view with another train wreck conf call for Street.

The company missed estimates for its fourth quarter and issued a downbeat full-year production outlook that sent the stock plunging. Even some Tesla bulls expressed disappointment after the latest earnings report.\n\n\"We were dead wrong expecting Musk and team to step up like adults in the room on the call and give a strategic and financial overview of the ongoing price cuts, margin structure, and fluctuating demand....instead we got a high level Tesla long term view with another train wreck conference call,\" said Wedbush analysts led by Dan Ives in a note on Thursday.\n\nStory continues\n\nInstead of a one-vote-one-share dynamic, the dual class structure Musk wants entails super-voting shares counting for many more votes, allowing its owners to hold more sway over company decisions without the company having to dilute everyone else's stake.\n\nBut the creation of a multiple-class share structure typically requires shareholder approval. In cases where company founders and early investors hold the majority of shares and want a dual class arrangement, they can vote it into existence. In Musk's case, however, that would require shareholders to essentially give up their own voting influence to empower an impulsive and headstrong executive \u2014 one who already faces criticism of acting against the interests of the company in favor of his own whims and other business endeavors. \"What I'm aiming for is a strong influence but not control,\" Musk said, explaining that his desire for a 25% stake in Tesla would grant him just enough power. (Photo by STR/NurPhoto via Getty Images) (NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nThat's not an impossible scenario. But it is an unlikely one.\n\nTesla could also grant Musk's desired level of influence by simply handing over additional shares. But that would dilute the ownership of existing shareholders, and would draw further criticism that the board of directors is too deferential to Musk without serving as a check on his power.\n\nThe extra shares would also constitute an enormous pay raise for Musk. Tesla is already entangled in litigation that stemmed from his 2018 compensation package, which has the potential to add up to more than $50 billion. A shareholder lawsuit alleged the pay plan constituted corporate waste and unjust enrichment, and that board members breached their fiduciary duties by approving the package.\n\nOn Thursday shares fell nearly 10%.\n\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

In 2022, global EV sales exceeded 10 million. Further, EV sales for last year are likely at 14 million and would account for 18% of total car sales. As healthy growth sustains, I am bullish on some of the best EV stocks.\n\nI would further add that these numbers are dwarfed in comparison to the estimates for 2030. It\u2019s expected that global EV car stock will expand to 350 million vehicles by the end of the decade. Also, EVs would represent more than 60% of vehicles sold globally.\n\nA key conclusion from these estimates is that there is huge growth potential for EV companies. Revenue can increase multi-fold in the next five to seven years. This is likely to translate into significant cash flow upside and massive value creation.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAs the world faces near-term macroeconomic headwinds, it\u2019s a good time to consider exposure to attractively valued EV stocks. In my view, a portfolio of these stocks can deliver 10x returns by 2030.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) supercharging station during the day.\n\nSource: Arina P Habich / Shutterstock.com\n\nA sub-portfolio of electric vehicle stocks would be incomplete without considering exposure to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). In July 2023, TSLA stock had surged to highs of $299. The considering correction has followed to current levels of $209 and it seems like a good accumulation opportunity.\n\nWith mass deliveries of Cybertruck impending, I am positive on the stock trending higher. Further, Roadster is also in the pipeline and I believe that Tesla\u2019s deliveries growth will be healthy in the next few years.\n\nIn the long term, Tesla has set an ambitious target of producing 20 million EVs annually by 2030. Of course, there will be challenges related to competition. However, the market has potential and Tesla has high financial flexibility to set-up multiple new factories.\n\nTesla has also indicated that it\u2019s committed to halving EV production cost. If this is achieved in the coming years, the Company can see delivery volumes skyrocketing in emerging markets like India and Indonesia, among others.\n\nStory continues\n\nLi Auto (LI) Li Auto (Li Xiang) brand logo and electric car in store. A Chinese EV(electric vehicle) company\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmong emerging Chinese EV stocks, Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI) looks like the best bet. While Chinese market sentiments have depressed the stock, I am bullish on multibagger returns over the next five years. It\u2019s worth noting that LI stock is trading at a forward price-earnings ratio of 20. With the Company is growing at over 100% on a year-on-year basis, undervaluation is significant.\n\nFor 2023, Li Auto reported deliveries growth of 182.2% on a year-on-year basis to 376,030. With the launch of Li MEGA in March, I expect deliveries growth to remain strong. Further, deliveries growth will be supported by aggressive retail expansion within China.\n\nLi Auto has also been active on the innovation front. The Company has partnered with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) to explore the integration of artificial intelligence and electric vehicles. The Company will be using Nvidia\u2019s Drive Thor autonomous driving chip in its next-generation EVs from 2025.\n\nPanasonic Holdings (PCRFY) A Panasonic (PCRFY) sign hanging in Beijing, China. generation z\n\nSource: testing/Shutterstock.com\n\nPanasonic Holdings (OTCMKTS:PACRFY) is among the undervalued millionaire maker EV stocks to buy. PCRFY stock trades at an attractive forward price-earnings ratio of 7.8 and offers a dividend yield of 2.38%. With ambitious expansion plans for the EV battery business, I am optimistic on the stock delivering multibagger returns.\n\nPanasonic Holdings has guided to increase EV battery capacity to 200GWh by financial year 2031. This would imply quadrupling of capacity and translate into healthy revenue growth. At the same time, the Company has guided for continued improvement in EBITDA margin.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that innovation will continue to provide an edge to Panasonic. The Company is working on batteries that have higher energy density. The target is to increasing volumetric energy density to 1,000 Wh/L by 2031. This will be 25% higher from current levels. With aggressive expansion and focus on innovation, Panasonic is positioned to be a value creator.\n\nAlbemarle Corporation (ALB) Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com\n\nIt\u2019s expected that global demand for lithium will surge five-folds by 2030 on the back of demand for EV batteries. It\u2019s therefore important to hold few lithium stocks for multibagger returns. With lithium prices correcting sharply, it\u2019s the best time to accumulate undervalued names.\n\nAlbemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB) stock looks massively undervalued at a forward price-earnings ratio of 5.6. The 1.33% dividend yield stock might have bottomed out and I expect a strong rally after consolidation.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Albemarle is likely to see significant EBITDA margin contraction. However, that\u2019s discounted in the stock. An important point to note is that even with depressed lithium price, Albemarle has guided for operating cash flow of $600 to $800 million for 2023.\n\nOnce lithium trends higher and Albemarle boosts its lithium conversion capacity, cash flows will be robust. Albemarle targets increasing lithium conversion capacity to 600ktpa by 2027. This would imply tripling of capacity from 2022 levels. Of course, a lot depends on the time-line for recovery in lithium prices.\n\nLithium Americas (LAC) smartphone with logo of Canadian company Lithium Americas Corp on screen\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nLithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) is a lithium miner that\u2019s likely to deliver 10x returns within the next five years. At a market valuation of $741 million, Lithium Americas is a steal considering the asset potential.\n\nTo put things into perspective, the Company\u2019s Thacker Pass project has an after-tax net present value of $5.7 billion. Further, the asset has a mine life of 40 years and is expected to deliver an average annual EBITDA of $1.1 billion. Therefore, the asset is a cash flow machine and once lithium trends higher, LAC stock is likely to skyrocket.\n\nI must add here that I don\u2019t see any financing concerns related to project construction. General Motors (NYSE:GM) will be infusing $650 million in the project. The Company has also committed a ten-year offtake agreement from phase one of the project. Therefore, lithium price is the only factor that holding back the stock from surging. I would buy at current levels and hold with patience for the next few years.\n\nSolid Power (SLDP) Smartphone with logo of American battery company Solid Power Inc. on screen in front of business website. Focus on center-left of phone display.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSolid Power (NASDAQ:SLDP) is among the high-risk bets that can deliver multibagger returns. The Company is working towards the commercialization of solid-state batteries. If there is success on that front, SLDP stock is an easy 10x from current levels of $1.5.\n\nIn terms of news flow, there are two important points to note. First, Solid Power has made its first A-1 EV cell deliveries to BMW to formally enter automotive qualification. Positive results from validation testing can be a game-changer.\n\nFurther, the Company has deepened its partnership with SK On. As a part of the agreement, Solid Power will license its cell designs and production processes to the latter. Additionally, Solid Power will be installing a pilot cell production line for SK On at Korea facility.\n\nTechnology licensing is likely to help in accelerating the commercialization through parallel research and development. I must add that in December 2022, the Company licensed its cell design and manufacturing process to BMW (OTCMKTS:BMWYY) for parallel R&D. Therefore, with strong partners, I am optimistic on Solid Power achieving commercialization by 2026.\n\nBlink Charging (BLNK) a blink charging station, BLNK stock\n\nSource: David Tonelson/Shutterstock.com\n\nAmong EV charging stocks, Blink Charging (NASDAQ:BLNK) looks attractive after a big correction. With positive news on the financial front, I expect BLNK stock to trend higher.\n\nThe first reason to be positive on Blink is stellar growth. For Q3 2023, the Company reported revenue of $43 million. On a year-on-year basis, revenue surged by 152%. With significant penetration potential, I expect healthy revenue growth to sustain in the coming years.\n\nThe second positive to note is that Blink has guided for gross margin of 30% for 2023. Further, the Company expects to achieve positive adjusted EBITDA by December 2024. With healthy revenue growth, I expect continued margin expansion on operating leverage.\n\nFrom a growth perspective, the Company has contracted 1,435 DC-fast chargers during the first nine months of 2023. This has translated into $27 million in recognized revenue. Product diversification is likely to support strong growth.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

My name is Martin Viecha, VP of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Vaibhav Taneja, and a number of other executives. Our Q4 results were announced at about 3.00 pm Central Time in the Update Deck we published at the same link as this webcast. During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC. During the question-and-answer portion of today's call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Please use the raise hand button to join the question queue. But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?\n\nElon Musk: Thank you. So the Tesla team did an incredible job in 2023. We achieved record production and deliveries of over 1.8 million vehicles in line with our official guidance. And in Q4, we were producing vehicles at an annualized run rate of almost 2 million cars a year. This is really a phenomenal achievement. Looking at just the Fremont factory alone, we made 560,000 cars. This is a record. In fact, it's the highest output of automotive plants in North America. And people are often surprised that the highest output factory, car factory in North America is in the San Francisco Bay area. It's a little counterintuitive, perhaps. And it's really had an incredibly positive impact on that entire area. What would have been a rundown strip mall is the highest productivity car plant in the Americas.\n\nStory continues A mix of Tesla electric cars driving on a highway, showing the latest electric transportation technology.\n\nThink about that. It was derelict when we got it, and now it's the most productive plant in this entire part of the world. And it's enriched the community in so many different ways. It's really a gem. So I'm super proud of the people that work there. Model Y became the best-selling vehicle globally, as predicted. The best-selling vehicle of any kind, not just electric vehicles with over 1.2 million units delivered. The energy storage business delivered nearly 15 gigawatt hours of batteries in 2023, compared to 6.5 gigawatt hours the year before. So tremendous year-over-year growth, triple-digits. And yeah, I think we'll continue to see very strong growth in storage, as predicted. I said for many years that the storage business would grow much faster than the car business, and it is doing that.\n\nFree cash flow remains strong at $4.4 billion in 2023, in spite of record spending on future projects. So we had record CapEx expenses as well as record R&D. This brings us to 2024. There's a lot to look forward to in 2024. Tesla is currently between two major growth waves. We're focused on making sure that our next growth wave, driven by next-gen vehicle, energy storage, full self-driving, other projects, is executed as well as possible. For full self-driving, we've released Version 12, which is a complete architectural rewrite compared to prior versions. This is end-to-end artificial intelligence. So another bit nets basically photons in and controls out, and it really is quite a profound difference. This is currently just with employees and a few customers, but we will be rolling out to all customers in the U.S. who request full self-driving in the weeks to come.\n\nThat's over 400,000 vehicles in North America. So this is the first-time AI is being used, not just for object perception, but for path planning and vehicle controls. We replaced 330,000 lines of C++ code with neural nets. It's really quite remarkable. Yeah, sort of, as a side note, I think Tesla is probably the most efficient company in the world for AI inference. Out of necessity, we've actually had to be extremely good at getting the most out of hardware, because Hardware 3 at this point is several years old. So I think we're quite far ahead of any other company in the world in terms of AI and inference efficiency, which is going to be a very important metric in the future in many arenas. So, the new Model 3 is now available globally. So we did an updated Model 3.\n\nSee also 16 Most Profitable New Stocks Today and 11 Stocks That Will Make You Rich in 5-10 Years.\n\nTo continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-inc-nasdaq-tsla-q4-150736569.html", "symbols": ["TL0.F", "TL0.XETRA", "TSLA.MX", "TSLA.US", "TSLA34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.997, "neg": 0.008, "neu": 0.884, "pos": 0.107}}, {"date": "2024-01-25T15:00:42+00:00", "title": "Q4 2023 Tesla Inc Earnings Call", "content": "Participants\n\nAndrew D.

So I don't -- I think we're quite far ahead of any other company in the world in terms of AI inference efficiency, which is going to be a very important metric in the future in many arenas.\r\nSo see, the new Model 3 is now available globally, so we did an update in Model 3. While the car looks similar, a lot of work has gone into the vehicle to make it better in every way. It is significantly quieter, more refined, better equipped, has longer range and many other improvements, and I recommend taking it for a test drive. If you have not driven a Model 3 in a long time, you should really try the new one, so steady improvements.\r\nAnd we're very far along on our next-generation low-cost vehicle. This is an earnings call, not a product announcement. So there'll not be many questions that try to ask us about new products coming, but we reserve product announcements for product announcements, not earning calls. So -- but we're very excited about this, and this is really going to be profound not just in its design of the vehicle itself but in the design of the manufacturing system. This is a revolutionary manufacturing system, significant -- far more advanced than any other automotive manufacturing system in the world like by a significant margin.\r\nSeveral years ago, I said the -- perhaps the most important competitive characteristic of Tesla in the future will be manufacturing technology. And you will really see that come to bear with our next-gen vehicle.\r\nThe first manufacturing location for this will be at our Gigafactory and headquarters in Austin, Texas. And then we'll follow that up with other locations around the world, probably our -- the factory we built in Mexico will be second, and then we'll be looking to identify a third location perhaps by the end of this year or early next outside of North America.\r\nIn conclusion, we had a great year with record production, record deliveries and a strong free cash flow in spite of a very high interest rate environment. And we are focused on exciting new projects that will -- I think, ultimately, if we execute on all these things, and it is very hard to do all these things, not a sure thing, but I do see a path where Tesla could 1 day be the most valuable company in the world. I do want to emphasize that is not an easy path and a very difficult one, but it is now a set of possible outcomes. And previously, I would not have thought it is a set of possible outcome. \r\nSo -- and thank you again to all of our investors, our employees and our suppliers for a strong year and looking forward to a great 2024 and years to come. Thank you.\n\nStory continues\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nThank you, and our CFO, Vaibhav, has some opening remarks as well.\n\nVaibhav Taneja\n\nThanks, Martin. Good afternoon, everyone. As Elon mentioned, we had a record year in terms of both production and deliveries for our auto business as well as record deployments in our energy business. This was achieved despite 2023 being a challenging year in terms of higher interest rates and higher inflation. Big thanks to our customer for being with us through this challenging period. I would also like to thank the whole Tesla team for their resolve and dedication throughout.\r\nIn terms of our 2023 financials, we ended the year with over $96 billion of revenue and generated $4.4 billion of free cash flow to end the year with over $29 billion of cash and investments on hand. Our 2023 GAAP net income was impacted by the recognition of onetime noncash benefit of $5.9 billion from the release of valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets. This was due to our recent history of sustained profitability and is similar to several other companies who have recently gone through a similar change in their accounting.\r\nAccordingly, starting with Q1, our booked tax rate will now be more in line with other companies in the S&P 500. In our vehicle business, we continue to see improvements in our per unit cost despite us being in the early phase of Cybertruck era. As a result, our auto gross margin improved sequentially. That said, predicting auto gross margins is extremely challenging since there are many moving parts to this equation, some of which are out of our control, like the change in tariffs or local incentives, to name a few. While the teams are focused on cost reductions, we are approaching the limits within our current platforms.\r\nOn the demand front, as promised, we made investments in digital campaigns in 2023. We fully appreciate the importance of customer education as we are still in the customer acquisition phase. Our data suggests that around 90% of our vehicle buyers in 2023 never owned a Tesla before. We are being creative in figuring out ways to bring in new customers and educate them about the benefits of owning a Tesla versus gas-powered vehicles, the key among them being total cost of ownership. This concept is mostly overlooked for just the upfront cost. We will be rigorous in evaluating our campaigns, curating the content and optimizing spend accordingly to support the overall demand.\r\nThere are 2 additional things I would like to mention as it relates to the U.S. market. First, for customers who qualify for buyer credit, we now offer that as a point-of-sale benefit for Model Y, which means an immediate reduction of $7,500 at the time of purchase to the end customer. Secondly, we continue to offer very attractive lease rates for Model 3 and Y using our partner leasing program. Note that the sales under this program are recognized as upfront revenue and reported within automotive sales.\r\nOur Energy Storage business had another record year with deployments more than doubling and revenues increasing by more than 50%. This business is poised to again surpass our auto business in terms of growth rate in 2024. This has been in the works for quite some time with us laying the foundation a few years back by building our Megafactory in metro. I would like to thank the whole Tesla energy team for their efforts to make this a reality.\r\nOur services and others business also started contributing meaningfully to our results, and our fleets -- as our fleets grows as we expect the fleet-based revenues from supercharging, used cars and services to continue to increase. For 2024, our focus is to continue growing our output, continuing our cost reduction efforts and increasing investments in our future growth initiatives. Accordingly, we are currently expecting our capital expenditure for 2024 to be in excess of $10 million. We believe this would be critical in helping us lay the foundation for the next phase of growth.\r\nOnce again, I would like to thank everybody at Tesla, our investors and our suppliers for being with us in this journey. We can open it up to questions, Martin.\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nThank you, and let's go through investor questions. Question #1 is from Michael. Given that you moved the start of the next-generation compact vehicle production to Austin, has the time line improved so that we might see the next-generation platform vehicles in 2025?\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nWe -- I mean I won't certainly say things with -- that should be taken with a grain of salt since I'm often optimistic. But I don't want to blow your mind, but I'm often optimistic regarding time. But our current schedule shows that we will start production towards the end of 2025, sometime in the second half. That's just what our current schedule says. There's a lot of new technology, like a tremendous amount of new revolutionary manufacturing technology here.\r\nThe reason I want to put this new revolutionary manufacturing line at Giga Texas was because we really need the engineers to be living on the line. This is not sort of off-the-shelf, just works type of thing. And it's just a lot easier for Tesla engineering to live on the line if it's in Austin versus elsewhere. So -- but we are currently expecting to start production second half of next year. That will be a challenging production ramp. Like I can't emphasize, we'll be sleeping on the line practically. In fact, not practically, we will be.\r\nBut I am confident that once it is going, it will be head and shoulders above any other manufacturing technology that exists anywhere in the world. It's next level. So it's always difficult to predict what that S curve of manufacturing looks like. It always starts off real slow, and then it grows exponentially. So -- and predicting that intermediate S curve is difficult but -- so I don't know. It's hard to say what the unit volume would be next year. We're not going to make any predictions on that front, but it does seem quite likely that we will start production next year.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nThank you. The next question is from Michael again. What has been the barrier to ramping 4680 cells into multimillion cells per week rate? And when do you expect to get there? Drew?\n\nAndrew D. Baglino\n\nYes. First, I just want to allay any concerns regarding 4680 limiting the Cybertruck ramp because I've seen some people commenting about that. Today, 4680 production is ahead of the ramp with actually weeks of finished cell inventory. And the goal is to keep it that way not only for Cyber but for our future vehicle programs. And as Elon said, it is an S curve here too. Like it's hard to predict these things. But I'm just describing our goals.\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nIt's a hard problem. Like there are entire companies where all they do is make battery cells. That's like all they do.\n\nAndrew D. Baglino\n\nIndeed. Indeed.\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nWe do a lot of other things. And we've got a lot of breakthrough technologies that take time to figure out what is -- it's not just that it's a 46-millimeter diameter by 80-millimeter fuel cell. That's just the dimensions. There's tremendous amount of new technology in the cell itself.\n\nAndrew D. Baglino\n\nAnd manufacturing technology.\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nYes, exactly.\n\nAndrew D. Baglino\n\nAnd just regarding what the team was able to do in Q4, Texas successfully swapped line 1 from the Model Y design of the cell to the Cybertruck design of the cell, which was the 10% cell energy increase I've mentioned before. And as with any major new product introduction, the factory and engineering teams collaborated to ensure quality of the new design and the process changes as their first priority. And now our focus returns to cost and production ramp in Q1.\r\nAnd in terms of what we're doing, we're currently running 1 production line, 1 assembly line, using 2 assembly lines in addition for yield and rate improvement trials, and we have a fourth in commissioning, and 4 more will be installed starting in Q3 this year. So definitely, this is a big year for ramping 4680.\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nWe also do want to emphasize that we also expect to ramp orders from our suppliers. So this is not about replacing our suppliers. It's about supplementing our suppliers. So we are very appreciative of our suppliers. Panasonic, obviously, is our longest supplier. They're an amazing company. We've got CATL. We've got LG and BYD.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nThank you. The next question is from Adam. Should retail shareholders be concerned that Elon has stated that he is uncomfortable expanding AI and robotics at Tesla if he doesn't have 25% of voting?\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nYes. I guess let me explain why -- what my concern is here, which is that I see a path to creating an artificial intelligence and robotics juggernaut of truly immense capability and power. And my concern would be -- I don't want to control it, but if I have so little influence over the company at that stage that I could sort of be voted out by some sort of random shareholder advisory firm -- we've had a lot of challenges with institutional shareholder services, ISS, I call them ISIS, and Glass Lewis, which there's a lot of activists that basically infiltrate those organizations and have strange ideas about what should be done.\r\nSo I want to have enough to be -- like if we could do a dual-class stock, that would be ideal. I'm not looking for additional economics. I just want to be an effective steward of very powerful technology.\r\nAnd the reason I just sort of roughly picked approximately 25% was that that's not so much that I can control the company even if I go bonkers. And if I'm like mad, they can throw me out, but it's enough that I have a strong influence. That's what I'm aiming for, is a strong influence but not control. There's some way to achieve that, that would be great.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nThank you. The next question is what is your expectation for automotive gross margin ex regulatory credits for the full year?\n\nVaibhav Taneja\n\nLike I said in my opening remarks, we're focused on reducing the cost of our vehicles. This is very extensive and involved exercise, where we -- whereby we look at not just the component cost down to -- but down to the packaging used to get the materials to the production floor. Each element of the cost is scrutinized to optimize further.\r\nA few pennies saved at the subcomponent level, whether through engineering redesign or from many other things, which I mentioned, leads to cost reduction. This is a constant exercise, and we just have to chase down every penny possible. We have a strong team, which is hyper focused on this. However, this is a very difficult thing to predict precisely because there are a lot of...\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nWe don't know. We don't have a crystal ball, so it's difficult for us to predict this with precision. If the interest rates come down quickly, I think margins will be good. And if they don't come down quickly, they won't be that good. Yes.\r\nIt's always important to remember that the vast majority of people buying a car is about the monthly payment. It's not that people don't want -- we have tons of -- we have lots of people who want to buy our car but simply cannot afford it. And that -- as that -- as interest rates drop and that monthly payment drops, then they're able to afford it and they buy the car. It's pretty straightforward. And there are no tricks around -- to get around this.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nOkay. Thank you. The next question is does the company anticipate 50% volume CAGR to be realized in either 2024 or 2025? If not, why not?\n\nVaibhav Taneja\n\nAs we have said in our prior guidance, there will be periods where we won't be growing at the same rate as before. We are between 2 major growth waves. The first one began with the global expansion of Model 3 and Y., and we believe the next one will be initiated with the next-generation platform. In 2024, our volume growth will be lower, as we have said, because we're trying to focus the team on the launch of the next-generation vehicle.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nAll right. Thank you very much. The next question is from Michael. When will Tesla start construction on the Giga Nevada expansion and Giga Mexico? And when can we expect each of these to produce their first products such as 4680 cell semi and the next-gen vehicles?\n\nAndrew D. Baglino\n\nWe have recently broken ground the next phase of Giga Nevada expansion to incorporate semi and other projects. But as said earlier, as regarding Mexico, we want to first demonstrate success with the next-generation platform in Austin before we start construction. Therefore, we have started the long lead work to get the basics ready and plan to follow our recipe from the 3, Y ramp with Shanghai, where we started with learnings from Fremont and ramped really quickly.\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nYes, exactly. It's important to emphasize that, I mean, Model 3 production was 3 years of hell, honestly before, some of the really worst years of my life, frankly. Still have mental scar tissue from that, from those 3 years as do many. But then -- and then Model Y was somewhat of a variant on Model 3, so a much easier situation.\r\nAnd then we're able to actually do an improved -- slightly improved versions of -- in some cases, significantly improved versions of the Model Y production line in Shanghai and Berlin. And that's the right -- I think the sensible way to go about things, is kind of figure out the core technology of the manufacturing line and then replicate it with improvements throughout the world.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nThank you. The next question for Michael is has there been any progress made with an FSD licensing agreement with another company?\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nI really think lots of car companies should be asking for FSD licenses, but -- and we've had some tentative conversations, but I think they don't believe it's real quite yet. I think that will become obvious probably this year. And I do want to emphasize that if I were CEO of another car company, I would definitely be calling Tesla and asking to license Tesla full self-driving technology. It's definitely the smart move.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nThank you. The next question from Siddharth, what is the time line for Optimus first production of volume production line? And what are the barriers to getting there?\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nOptimus obviously is a very new product, an extremely revolutionary product and something that I think has the potential to far exceed the value of everything else at Tesla combined. And when you think of an economy, economy is productivity per capita times capita. And what if there's no limit to capita? There's no limit to the economy. And the technologies that we -- the AI technologies we've developed for the car translate quite well to a humanoid robot because the car is just a robot on 4 wheels.\r\nTesla is arguably already the biggest robot maker in the world. It's just a 4-wheeled robot. So Optimus is a robot with -- a humanoid robot with arms and legs, just by far the most sophisticated humanoid robot that's being developed anywhere in the world.\r\nI think we've got a good chance of shipping some number of Optimus units next year. This is a brand-new product, a lot of uncertainty as -- when you have -- when there's a lot of uncertainty in your uncharted territory, it's obviously impossible to make a precise prediction.\r\nBut we will be updating the public with progress on Optimus every few months. And you can see that the -- it's advancing very quickly. I was just in the Optimus lab actually until late last night. Like midnight or something, I finally left the Optimus lab. The team is doing amazing work.\r\nThat's obviously the case where we want to make sure that Optimus is safe, especially at scale and that there's no -- it should be impossible for any centralized control to upload malware to a humanoid robot. So we're going to want to fold in localized shutoff that cannot be updated from the -- from a central server. That's the case where we really have to -- extreme thought to safety. But like I said, I do think it has the potential to be the most valuable product of any kind ever by far.\n\nAndrew D. Baglino\n\nJust to comment on the barrier. I think the barrier, and we've talked about this, is like getting it to actually do something useful. Like we can get it to walk around. We can get it to do things, but it's like that utility part.\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nIt can already do some useful things.\n\nAndrew D. Baglino\n\nBut like to making millions of these things, it's like utility. You got to get to utility of it.\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nYes, a smart robot that can do -- that's capable of doing generalized tasks is what it will be. And in terms of doing moderately specialized tasks, well, it can already do that, and it'll just get better through the course of the year.\r\nAs we improve the technology in the car, we improve the technology in Optimus at the same time. It runs the same AI inference computer that's on the car, same training technology. I mean we're really building the future. I mean the Optimus lab looks like the set of Westworld, but admittedly, that was not a super utopian situation.\n\nAndrew D. Baglino\n\nYes, not the best reference.\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nYes. The creators of Westworld, Jon Nolan -- Lisa Joy, Nolan, all friends of mine actually, and I invited them to come see the lab. I think -- well, come see it hopefully soon. It's pretty wild, especially the sort of subsystem test stands, where you just got like one leg on a test stand just doing repetitive exercises and one arm in a test stand, pretty wild. Yes.\n\nAndrew D. Baglino\n\nWe're not entering Westworld anytime soon.\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nRight, right. We're going to take safety very, very seriously.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nThank you. The next question from Nermin is how many Cybertruck orders are in the queue? And when do you anticipate to be able to fulfill existing orders?\n\nUnidentified Company Representative\n\nFirst of all, I want to thank all of the Cybertruck reservation holders for their patience. The reservation to order conversion rate so far has been very, very encouraging. If the trend continues, as it very likely to be, we will soon sort out all the builds in 2024. And also, we have new orders come in after the launch. The order numbers keep growing. So we're now all hands on deck focused on ramping, so we can fulfill all the demands in a reduced lead time.\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nYes, it's important to emphasize that this is very much a production-constrained situation, not a demand-constrained situation. And obviously, we could dramatically raise the price, but that doesn't feel right to us to sort of gouge people for early delivery. So -- but really, the demand is off the hook. As long as we have -- the price is affordable, I mean, I see us ultimately delivering on the order of like 0.25 million, something like 0.25 million Cybertrucks a year in North America but maybe more but give or take, roughly on that time frame. And it's -- I mean, it sure is a head turner. Yes.\n\nVaibhav Taneja\n\nDefinitely is. Anywhere you go, people look at you. They give you thumbs up.\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nYes. It's like finally the future looks like the future. It's just that with the other trucks on the road there, which -- and there are some very good trucks on the road. But if you were to switch out the brand name, you would hardly know which company made them. But you definitely would know the Cybertruck. It's our best product ever.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nAll right. Thank you. The next question is can we get Tesla energy volumes reported in the production and delivery release.\n\nAndrew D. Baglino\n\nYes. We will strive to do so starting from this quarter. And just a brief update from the business perspective. Megapack continues to see strong demand signals globally, driving consistent growth trajectory through '24 and '25. We want to thank all of our partners who put their trust in the Megapack team to execute on critical infrastructure around the world. And I would like to personally thank the Megapack engineering and production teams for their strong 2023 execution. Lathrop continues to ramp through 2024 with the operation of a second final assembly line to double capacity from 20 to 40 gigawatt hours by the end of the year.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nThank you. And the last investor question is from Siddharth. What are the preliminary results on the return on investment of your ads and education campaign? Given that many people still lack awareness the Tesla average price is less than the average non-luxury car price of $45,000, will you expand educational ads?\n\nUnidentified Company Representative\n\nAs Elon mentioned, the ultimate solution to increase EV adoption is really address the affordability issue. But at the same time, we do aware -- there's awareness issue as well. So in Q4, we ran a series of digital campaigns, very targeted digital campaigns across different geos and different channel. The target of these tests is really just to drive awareness and ultimately measure the return on investment on those digital channels.\r\nAnd the messaging we're driving is really focused on our product and also try to address some of the misconception of the EV, such as safety, affordability. And one particular awareness campaign where you run -- in Texas, we reached the audience about 10 million unique viewers and generally close to 0.5 million visits to our website. A large number of these viewers are first-time visitors to our site.\r\nThe traffic through these digital channels actually behave very similar to those organic traffic come to our website. So going forward, we're just going to keep exploring different channels and doing our trials to get a better understanding of the effectiveness of this digital campaign.\n\nVaibhav Taneja\n\nBut I would also like to caution that we will be very careful that we don't want to overspend on this side. We want to make sure people are aware, but we'll -- that's where we'll keep tweaking our methodology about how and where we spend the money because we understand the importance of increasing awareness, but at the same token, we don't want to spend a lot of money on just creating awareness.\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nYes. I mean there are some geographies where our market share is remarkably low, like Japan for example. Now we obviously need to make sure that we have Superchargers in the right locations and the service centers are there and the product works well in Japan, but Japan is the third largest car market in the world, of any country.\r\nSo -- and we should at least have a market share proportionate to, say, other non-Japanese carmakers like Mercedes or BMW, which we do not currently have. So I think that's the case. And when I talk to friends of mine in Japan, they're like -- there is like quite a lack of awareness of Tesla. So that's a case where we definitely need to increase awareness in countries and regions where there is, yes, not that much awareness.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nThank you. Let's go to analyst questions. The first question comes from Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research. Pierre, can you hear us?\n\nPierre C. Ferragu\n\nOkay. Well, it's really tough to find the unmute button on Teams, guys. I'm sorry for being late. So yes, my question would be on like the cost reduction. You've talked about it already a lot. And if I look at it over the last like 5, 6 quarters on average, the COGS per car has been coming down like more than 2% sequentially on average. So that means you are like on a trajectory of COGS per car going down 10% a year. So that's probably like unheard of in the auto industry. I don't think any car manufacturer ever achieved that.\r\nBut that's very, very mundane and very -- it's a good performance, but it's a very normal performance in a lot of other manufacturing industry like microelectronics or consumer electronics. And so I'd love to hear your thoughts about whether you consider yourself closer to the latter, to like a microelectronics business, where you have this ability to actually always improve costs, you have more control on how things are pulled together into your cars, and you see yourself sustainably taking costs down with that kind of pace. Or do you think your ability to take down cost is actually going to become more like in line with the rest in the industry over time?\n\nVaibhav Taneja\n\nYes. I think I've covered this in a pretty lengthy detail even in my opening remarks and in a previous question, but to just further clarify, we are constantly looking for what we can do to reduce costs. Like I said, it's a game of pennies. We've talked about it before as well. And the team is constantly going and checking where can we reduce the cost further. And do I believe that we will have the same pace which you've seen over the past few years? Probably not because, remember, we were coming out with a period wherein commodity prices were rising. So then we did see benefits coming from that.\r\nSo those are more or less taken care of, but there is more, which we're still chasing. And I would say a big kudos goes to the team out here at Tesla, both the engineering team as well as the supply chain team because every time we give them a challenge, they go gangbusters to try and figure out whatever they can to take out further cost.\r\nBut yes, I would -- like I said, I would want to caution that do not project the previous cost reduction at the same pace completely in the future because with our current platform, we are getting to a place wherein there is -- there are limitations.\n\nUnidentified Company Representative\n\nYes, the increased scale also sort of helps us there. As we introduce new products, we have the opportunity to go renegotiate existing suppliers for better pricing. We're looking at every penny like Vaibhav and Elon mentioned. Just to give you an example, our inbound logistics cost has come down by 22% year-over-year. And this is because of optimization on using returnable packaging as opposed to cardboard, which is even better for the environment; optimizing trucking routes, negotiating better pricing with shipping companies, with trucking companies, going with the full truckloads and just doing that sort of -- the bigger we become, the more we put far into these things and the more efficient we become as a result of it. So those work streams are going to continue.\n\nUnidentified Company Representative\n\nWe are also getting into the tiers of supply chain to see where there are opportunities. Getting to the Tier 2s, Tier 3, Tier 4 levels and then negotiate those pricing as well to get more efficiency out of the system.\n\nAndrew D. Baglino\n\nAnd then on the design side, we're not static, right, like especially in areas where the technology is still improving rapidly. Power electronics is a great example. We continue to bring improvements there that are like fundamentals sort of driven from the device up that result in cost reductions generation over generation. And they don't only go into the new vehicles. They come to the old vehicles as well. So that's closer to what you were talking about with like the microelectronics space. Some of that exists in the vehicle.\n\nUnidentified Company Representative\n\nAnd certainly, our car is more computer than car in many ways and has a lot of new tech over the last 100 years of automotive production, so everyone is trying to scrape pennies from.\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nWe have a crazy amount of compute in our cars compared to anyone else. It's like orders of magnitude.\n\nAndrew D. Baglino\n\nAnd we get to ride that down, right?\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nMaybe 1,000x more. I don't know, it's some nutty number.\n\nAndrew D. Baglino\n\nI mean like if I just look at the main microcontroller that makes the motor go, for example, like when we -- when I think about what that costs when we stuck it in a roadster in 2006, the cost now, there's like no comparison. So we've definitely been riding that electronics cost wave.\n\nUnidentified Company Representative\n\nAnd then even on like non -- what you call traditional vehicle side, we do things that no other automakers do to bring costs down through breaking down the way structures are built and the way we put our cars together. And I think that mindset that we have is very much closer to the microprocessor or power electronics industry than the automotive industry.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nThank you. Pierre, do you have a follow-up?\n\nPierre C. Ferragu\n\nYes, a quick one. It's -- you mentioned this like phase in which you are between 2 big growth periods. I'd love to hear you about what you consider the size of your addressable market with the portfolio you have today, like the 3, the Y, the X and the S. What's your estimate of your addressable market? You're shipping like probably about like a 2 million unit run rate today. And given the price points of these cars, what kind of market share of what you addressed with this car do you think you've already achieved today?\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nI don't know if we have -- did anybody -- I actually don't think we have a firm idea that's -- it's hard to say exactly.\n\nVaibhav Taneja\n\nYes, this -- I wouldn't say there's -- I mean, one way to think about it is look at the automotive industry as well. EVs still contribute a very small market share. So yes, our goal is to try and take as much market share out of that pie. But do I have a specific number to give you? I don't think we can say that with certainty.\n\nUnidentified Company Representative\n\nAnd it's a growing pie as well. It's like it's 9% today, but it could be 20% in a couple of years or in the future.\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nYes.\n\nUnidentified Company Representative\n\nAnd certainly, like the way we've looked at it, and we've always said this, it's not about how many EVs you can sell. It's how many great cars you can sell, how many vehicles you can sell. And that market's 100 million a year, and we're barely 2% of that. I still think there's 98% more to get.\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nI mean it's worth noting that if you look at, say, the average selling price of the other top-selling vehicles in the world, they are much lower priced than Model Y. So like a Toyota RAV4, Corolla, Honda Civic, that kind of thing, they're much lower priced than ours. So people are really stretching their wallets to be able to afford a Tesla. It's quite a difficult thing for them to do and remarkable that it's the best-selling car in unit volume despite being much more expensive than other high-volume cars.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nThank you. Let's go to the next analyst. The next question comes from Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley.\n\nAdam Michael Jonas\n\nSo I can't wait to see the Optimus lab. I'm sure everybody on this call feels the same way. Your last AI Day, Elon, was September 2022. Can we expect a Tesla AI Day this year? It seems like a lot has changed in that realm and is this year the time?\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nYes, it's a good question. We have found that when we do these AI Days, some of our competitors literally look at what we do on a frame-by-frame basis.\n\nAdam Michael Jonas\n\nThey do.\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nAnd then we find these things being copied.\n\nAndrew D. Baglino\n\nSame thing with Battery Day.\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nSame thing with Battery Day. So we have to be a little cautious about revealing the exact recipe of the secret sauce. But I think some kind of update would be good to do. I'll talk it over with the team. And yes, I think we might do something later this year. Our main goal with these AI Days is recruiting, so -- and to sort of change the perception of Tesla as people think of Tesla as a car company when they should be thinking of Tesla as an AI robotics company.\n\nAdam Michael Jonas\n\nMaybe as a follow-up, Elon, I'd love your thoughts on the topic of China-based OEMs expanding into western markets as that -- as the China market kind of gets saturated and there's a tremendous growth in the supply, how much success should Tesla investors allow for this competition to achieve in western markets? And can you envision a scenario where Tesla could partner with a Chinese OEM to help accelerate sustainable transport in markets like Europe and the United States?\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nWell, our observation is generally that the Chinese car companies are the most competitive car companies in the world. So I think they will have significant success outside of China, depending on what kind of tariffs or trade barriers are established. Frankly, I think if there are not trade barriers established, they will pretty much demolish most other car companies in the world. So they're extremely good.\r\nWe don't see an obvious opportunity to partner. Certainly, we're happy to -- except on the Supercharger front, we're obviously happy to give any electric car company access to our Supercharger network. We're also happy to license full self-driving, perhaps license other technologies and anything that could be helpful in advancing the sustainable energy revolution.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nThank you. And the next question comes from Dan Levy from Barclays.\n\nDan Meir Levy\n\nFirst, I'm wondering if you can just walk through some of the gating factors required to unlock your next-gen platform. You talked about a number of cost initiatives back at the Investor Day a year ago, things in manufacturing and powertrain. Maybe you can just give us a sense of where these initiatives stand.\r\nAnd do you believe -- we know that there's a number of new features and technologies in Cybertruck, things like 48-volt architecture really employing your 4680 batteries. To what extent do you think Cybertruck is really a proving ground for next-gen platform and is really going to be a gating factor to unlocking cost reductions needed for the next-gen platform?\n\nUnidentified Company Representative\n\nYes. I don't think that anything in Cybertruck should be considered gating for the next-gen platform. We're obviously doing a lot of manufacturing innovations, as Elon said, for the next-generation vehicle. When you do something at that scale, you have to prove it out. You don't just throw it on the line and just build it. So we're going through those validation phases for all those new manufacturing technologies now.\r\nSure, 48-volt was definitely something we wanted to carry forward, and it's something we hope the industry adopts as well. We're also open to partnering if everyone wants to do that.\n\nElon R. Musk\n\n(inaudible) but people really know that this is like inside-baseball thing, but, man, 48 -- it's so high time that the auto industry moved from 12 -- the random number of 12 to 48.\n\nUnidentified Company Representative\n\nRandom number of 48.\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nYes. Well, it's much less random.\n\nUnidentified Company Representative\n\nSlightly less random based on human injury but...\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nI mean dramatically reduces the amount of copper you need in the vehicle and moving to sort of higher bandwidth communications, sort of Ethernet level of communications as opposed to CAN bus, which is pretty slow. So it's really just bringing cars to...\n\nUnidentified Company Representative\n\nThe 21st century.\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nYes, pretty much. So certainly like -- it's like normal for a laptop.\n\nUnidentified Company Representative\n\nCertainly bringing that like is an evolution in our architecture of the vehicles, but it's not gating by any means. The gating work is just to finish the design and manufacturing of the car, test them out and get them going.\n\nAndrew D. Baglino\n\nYes, programs and execution, right? Right. So it's talking about like tooling lead time, manufacturing equipment lead time, factory lead time and executing this program.\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nThere's a lot of specialized machines that make the machine for our next-gen vehicle. So these are not machines you can just order from anyone. They actually have to design a machine that has never existed to build a car in a way that has never existed.\n\nAndrew D. Baglino\n\nYes. So you don't just have like a design validation phase, but you have an equipment design validation phase as well.\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nIt doesn't make it very hard to copy us because you have to copy the machine that makes the machine that makes the machine.\n\nUnidentified Company Representative\n\nTalking about tiers.\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nYes, yes, exactly, manufacturing inception. So I do think it's quite a powerful, sustainable advantage because there just is no place to go to order the machines that make our next-gen car that don't exist.\n\nDan Meir Levy\n\nAs a follow-up, your release does not mention Dojo, so if you could just provide us an update on where Dojo stands and at what point do you expect Dojo to be a resource in improving FSD. Or do you think that you now have sufficient supply of NVIDIA GPUs needed for the training of the system?\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nI mean the AI part of your question is -- that is a deep one. So we're obviously hedging our bets here with significant orders of NVIDIA GPUs. GPU is the wrong word. They really didn't see it -- there's no -- you can't like produce graphics, so that's not a graphic processing unit, neural net processing unit or something like that. Yes, GPU's a funny word, like vestigial.\r\nSo -- and a lot of our progress in self-driving is training limited. Something that's important with training, it's much like a human. The more effort you put into training, the less effort you need in inference. So just like a person, if you train in a subject, sort of class, 10,000 hours, the less mental effort it takes to do something. If you remember when you first started to drive how much of your mental capacity it took to drive, it was -- you had to be focused completely on driving. And after you've been driving for many years, it only takes a little bit of your mind to drive, and you can think about other things and still drive safely.\r\nSo the more training you do, the more efficient it is at the inference level. So we do need a lot of training. And we're pursuing the dual path of NVIDIA and Dojo, but I would think of Dojo as a long shot. It's a long shot worth taking because the payoff is potentially very high but it's not something that is a high probability. It's not like a sure thing at all. It's a high risk, high payoff program. Dojo is working, and it is doing training jobs, so -- and we are scaling it up. And we have plans for Dojo 1.5, Dojo 2, Dojo 3 and whatnot. So I think it's got potential.\r\nI can't emphasize enough, high risk, high payoff. So I think it still makes sense given the -- even if it's a low probability of success for the -- I think anyway -- I'm belaboring the subject. It's a very interesting program. It has the potential for something special. There's also our inference hardware in the car, so we're now on what's called Hardware 4, but it's actually version 2 of the Tesla-designed AI inference chip.\r\nAnd we're about to complete design of -- the terminology is a bit confusing. About to complete design of Hardware 5, which is actually version 3 of the Tesla-designed chip because the version 1 was Mobileye. Version 2 was NVIDIA, and then version 3 was Tesla. So -- and we're making gigantic improvements from 1 -- from Hardware 3 to 4 to 5.\r\nI mean there's a potentially interesting play where when cars are not in use in the future, that the in-car computer can do generalized AI tasks, can run a sort of GPT4 or 3 or something like that. If you've got tens of millions of vehicles out there, even in a robotaxi scenario, whether in heavy use, maybe they're used 50 out of 168 hours, that still leaves well over 100 hours of time available -- of compute hours. Like it's possible with the right architectural decisions that Tesla may, in the future, have more compute than everyone else combined.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nThank you. And the next question comes from Colin Langan from Wells Fargo.\n\nColin M. Langan\n\nAs we're thinking about going into 2024, the press release talks about hitting 36,000 or slightly above in Q4. And the comments on the release talk about approaching the [aperture] limits, and it sounds like you're continuing to try to [whittle] that away, but that sort of implies there's not much left.\r\nIn addition, you have the hourly wage increase, I guess, will add to that into next year. And I thought you said raw material costs are kind of -- that benefit is sort of almost played out. So is there an opportunity to continue to go below the 36,000? Or should we kind of be modeling that it kind of stays at this level into '24?\n\nVaibhav Taneja\n\nWe are definitely aware of the cost increases, which are coming through because of the wage increases. But like I said, we keep looking at other cost opportunities and try and figure out where else can we cut down. So there is definitely more opportunity to bring down costs further. I won't specifically guide to a number, which we will try and get to, but there's definitely more opportunity there.\n\nAndrew D. Baglino\n\nYes, we're chasing lots of cost opportunities on the design side still for 2024. North of 8 figures is what we're -- just in my organization. Lars has got a bunch. And then from a commodities perspective, it's such a long cycle time through the whole material supply chain that even with what we've already seen to this point, there's more to come on commodities reductions.\n\nUnidentified Company Representative\n\nAnd there's still some tailwind left on the commodities.\n\nAndrew D. Baglino\n\nThat's what I mean. Yes.\n\nUnidentified Company Representative\n\nAluminum and steel.\n\nAndrew D. Baglino\n\nYes. And battery materials.\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nIt boggles my mind to think that if we make a 1% improvement in cost, that's $1 billion. So it's like, on average, if we reduce the cost by $0.01, $1 billion. What? I mean we started off not long ago that we're only making like 10 cars a week. And yes, where does it lead ultimately? With good execution -- like I said, it's not a slam dunk, but with -- if we execute very well, I think Tesla could be the most valuable company in the world.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nThank you. Colin, do you have a follow-up question?\n\nColin M. Langan\n\nYes, just a quick follow-up. In the commentary, you mentioned the taxes would go to the S&P 500 level. I think you've been trending slightly below 10%. S&P, I think it's typically 25%-ish. Is that going to -- should we expect that to jump right up next year when we're modeling next year? Or would it be like a gradual change over the next few years? And any cash impact from that tax change as well that we should be considering?\n\nVaibhav Taneja\n\nYes. So there's no impact on cash taxes from the release of the valuation amount, which I spoke about. What it does is it's how you account for taxes on your books. So it's basically an accounting change wherein there are certain jurisdictions because we had enough NOLs, et cetera, wherein we didn't have to accrue book taxes. Now that the valuation allowance has been released and we have recognized deferred tax assets on the books, that means your tax rate immediately goes up.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nOkay. I think that's all the time we have for today. Thank you so much for all of your questions, and we'll speak to you again in 3 months. Thank you. Bye-bye.\n\nElon R.

Analysts polled by FactSet predicted a profit of 73 cents per share. Revenue was expected to be $25.64 billion.\n\nProfits were off because Tesla lowered prices worldwide through the year in an effort to boost its sales and market share.\n\nShares slid more than 9% in Thursday morning trading.\n\nWedbush's Dan Ives said in a client note that Tesla's conference call on Wednesday to go over its financial results left many frustrated.\n\n\u201cConsistent with last quarter\u2019s call, investors wanted to get their arms around the falling margins and constant, never ending price cuts seen globally, but instead, we heard from a much more cautious Musk who focused on production, next-gen vehicle timelines, and FSD/AI investments where much of the larger Tesla story was talked about instead of concrete guidance,\u201d Ives wrote.\n\nStill, the analyst remains optimistic on Tesla, believing that electric vehicle adoption to a broader mass market is near. However, Ives concedes there are still challenges to contend with.\n\n\u201cThis is a pivotal period for Musk to get Tesla through that will help shape (or haunt) its EV future,\" he said.\n\nJeffrey Osborne of TD Cowen said that in the short term, it will be hard for EV competitors to catch up to Tesla as the company focuses on electrical efficiency and investing in battery technology.

Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.\u00a0\r\n\r\nTop 5 Upgrades:\n\nDeutsche Bank upgraded Avis Budget(CAR) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $248, up from $234. The firm notes the stock's multiples continue to compress as sentiment has turned overwhelmingly negative as many bears appear to be casually assuming that issues at Hertz (HTZ) will eventually find their way over to Avis as well. BofA upgraded RTX (RTX) to Neutral from Underperform with a price target of $100, up from $78, to reflect better execution in servicing contaminated powder-metal discs in Geared Turbo Fan, or GTF, engines at Pratt & Whitney.  Oppenheimer upgraded Inovio Pharmaceuticals(INO) to Outperform from Perform with a $4 price target after hosting a call with a key opinion leader in recurrent respiratory papillomatosis and members of the company's management team. Opco thinks Inovio could be a commercial company in 2025 given the high unmet need for RRP patients.  BofA upgraded Heico (HEI) to Buy from Neutral with an unchanged price target of $220. The firm believes the pullback in the shares is \"overdone\" and sees continued strength at Heico.  Truist upgraded Vericel (VCEL) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $51, up from $39. The firm says stock's valuation does not reflect Vericel's growth acceleration potential and coming profit inflection.\n\nTop 5 Downgrades:\n\nKGI Securities downgraded Tesla (TSLA) to Neutral from Outperform with a price target of $213, down from $309. The company's Q4 earnings slightly missed estimates with gross margin down quarter-over-quarter, the firm notes.  BofA downgraded Boeing (BA) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $225, down from $255, in the wake of the Alaska Airlines (ALK) Flight 1282 incident and the subsequent 737 grounding.  Deutsche Bank downgraded Humana (HUM) to Hold from Buy with a price target of $360, down from $595. Humana reported Q4 results and issued 2024 guidance that missed the most pessimistic investor expectations, the firm tells investors in a research note.  Williams Trading downgraded VF Corp.(VFC) to Sell from Hold with a price target of $13, down from $17. Based on channel checks and commentary from some retailers at the recent ICR conference, there are no indications that Vans will turnaround in the foreseeable future, the analyst tells investors. Deutsche Bank downgraded Hertz (HTZ) to Hold from Buy with a price target of $9, down from $16. Hertz's well-chronicled electric vehicle strategy, which recently pivoted to include the sale of one-third of the fleet, leaves investors with little conviction in the company's true run rate earnings power over the next few years, the firm says.\n\nTop 5 Initiations:\n\nSeaport Research initiated coverage of IPG Photonics(IPGP) with a Buy rating and $125 price target. IPG has been mired in a period of earnings weakness since 2019, but the firm sees pressures that included COVID, supply chain, weak pricing, elevated costs in Russia and sluggishness in the General Industrial markets as \"increasingly moving behind\" the company.  BTIG initiated coverage of Bloom Energy(BE) with a Buy rating and $21 price target. The firm continues to believe hydrogen adoption will gain momentum and play a role in the energy transition.  RBC Capital initiated coverage of Axsome Therapeutics(AXSM) with an Outperform rating and $126 price target. The company's lead value driver Auvelity is showing good Rx growth, and sales can reach $296M in 2024, ahead of $272M consensus thanks to the earlier than expected adoption of the drug, the firm says.  OTR Global initiated coverage of CyberArk (CYBR) with a Positive view, stating that its checks showed CyberArk's brand and new mid-market logo gains contributed to \"strong\" Q4 sales for partners and expectations for their 2024 business to benefit from continued large enterprise success and expanded PAM adoption.  Benchmark initiated coverage of DDC Enterprise (DDC) with a Buy rating and $8 price target. The firm's positive views on the consumer brand company providing ready-to-heat, ready-to-cook, and ready-to-eat plant-based meal products are based on a belief that the RTE industry in China is at an onset of a multi-year growth trajectory and that DDC is poised to reap the benefit of high growth in the next three to five years.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-boeing-downgraded-wall-streets-144908926.html", "symbols": ["0J46.LSE", "ATQP.BE", "ATQP.F", "ATQP.MU", "ATQP.STU", "BA.MX", "BA.US", "BCO.F", "BCO.XETRA", "BOEI34.SA", "HC1.F", "HC1.STU", "HC1A.F", "HEI-A.US", "HEI.US", "IPF.BE", "IPF.F", "IPF.STU", "IPGP.US", "TL0.F"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.996, "neg": 0.029, "neu": 0.863, "pos": 0.108}}, {"date": "2024-01-25T14:38:00+00:00", "title": "Tesla Stock Is Down After Earnings \u2018Train Wreck.\u2019 Wall Street Is Cutting Target Prices.", "content": "Tesla reported worse-than-expected fourth quarter earnings.

Tesla reported adjusted EPS of $0.71 against $0.73 expected. Adjusted net income totaled $2.48 billion against the $2.61 billion expected by the Street.\n\nIn terms of its full-year production, Tesla said its \"vehicle volume growth rate may be notably lower than the growth rate achieved in 2023, as our teams work on the launch of the next-generation vehicle at Gigafactory Texas,\" indicating it would not reach Street estimates of 2.19 million for 2024, which would have been a 21% increase from 2023.\n\nCEO Elon Musk did confirm that the company's next-gen vehicle will be coming in the second half of 2025.\n\nIn its earnings release and later on the earnings call, Tesla also mentioned progress on its next-gen manufacturing platform.\n\n\"We are focused on bringing the next-generation platform to market as quickly as we can, with the plan to start production at Gigafactory Texas,\" the company said. \"This platform will revolutionize how vehicles are manufactured.\"\n\n\"We're very far along on our next-gen low-cost vehicle. We're really excited about this. This is a revolutionary manufacturing system, far more advanced than any other in the world,\" Musk said on the earnings call, clarifying that the company's current schedule has this vehicle hitting production in the second half of 2025. This echoes a report from Reuters earlier Wednesday that said Tesla told suppliers it wants to start production of a new mass-market EV codenamed \"Redwood\" in mid-2025.\n\nTesla's drop in profitability is likely due to downward pressure on margins since Tesla began its cost-cutting efforts late in 2022. Tesla reported a Q4 gross margin of 17.6% vs. 18.1% estimated, a big drop compared to a year ago and a sequential decline from the 17.9% achieved in Q3.\n\nStory continues\n\nHeadlines like rental car firm Hertz shedding thousands of EVs, Tesla cutting prices in China, a two-week production halt in Berlin, and CEO Elon Musk's ill-timed demand for more stock have also weighed on Tesla.\n\nEarlier this month, Tesla reported 484,507 deliveries in Q4, beating Street estimates of 483,173, per Bloomberg. That figure represents an all-time record quarter for Tesla, nearly 20,000 units higher than its past record quarter of 466,000 units delivered in Q2 of last year.\n\nFor the year, Tesla said that vehicle deliveries grew 38% year over year to 1.81 million and production grew 35% year over year to 1.85 million. While its 38% delivery growth rate was below its 50% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) target, Tesla previously said it would not attain that goal due to factory shutdowns and improvements that occurred in Q3.\n\nAlso of note are Cybertruck deliveries. Tesla did not break out this total in its Q4 delivery update, though the company did say the Cybertruck production ramp would take longer than other models.\n\n\"[Cybertruck] demand is off the hook,\" Musk said on the call, repeating similar comments that made last year. Tesla's new Cybertruck is shown on display at a Tesla store in San Diego, Calif., Nov. 20, 2023. (Mike Blake/REUTERS/File Photo) (Reuters / Reuters)\n\nMusk also addressed his comments from last week, claiming that he would need to secure greater control of Tesla if the company is going to meet its wide-reaching AI ambitions.\n\nMusk said on the earnings call that his concern would be, given his current shareholding, that he will have \"so little influence\" in the future that some major shareholder could strip away his control or make a bad decision.

(STR/NurPhoto via Getty Images) (NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\n\"I could be voted out by some random shareholder advisory firm,\" he said, citing Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass Lewis, two major shareholder proxy advisory companies, as an example.\n\n\"[A] lot of activists infiltrate shareholder rights organizations,\" Musk said, adding that he's \"not looking for additional economics; I just want to be an effective steward of powerful technology.\"\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Automotive gross margin came in at 18.8%, down from 25.9% reported in fourth-quarter 2022 but topping our forecast of 18.4%. This can be attributed to lower-than-expected cost of automotive sales.

Notably, energy storage deployments came in at 3.2 GWh, falling short of our projection of 4.1 GWh. Solar deployments declined both on a sequential and yearly basis amid high interest rates. The metric came in at 41 MW, significantly missing our forecast of 90MW.\n\nServices and Other revenues were $2,166 million, up 27.3% year over year, but missed our estimate of $2,203 million.

For a quick overview of\u00a0such stocks, read our article 5 Best Tech Stocks for the Next 5 Years.\n\nDespite the massive bull run of 2023 and eye-popping gains of tech stocks like Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and\u00a0 Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) fueled by the AI boom, many analysts believe tech companies are just getting started with AI innovation and the new era of gains that started after the launch of ChatGPT and generative AI in late 2022 has no end in sight. Short Hills' Steve Weiss recently said in a program on CNBC that despite all the hullaballoo around AI, the AI products offered by companies like Microsoft are not \"prime-day ready\" as they still need a lot of refinements and tweaks along with innovation before they could be relied upon. Weiss, who is highly bullish on Alphabet, said that it's not easy to break habits of users and concerns related to AI affecting Alphabet's search business are overdone. But what does that mean for the broader AI industry? That companies are still playing around and testing the waters with their initial AI product announcements shows that in the next five to ten years we will see a lot of AI-related innovation that could further push the stock prices of mega-cap tech stocks higher.\n\nThe long rally of 2023 and a rebound in tech stocks in 2024 after a brief decline has also showed that the AI-led rally in tech stocks could not be labeled as a bubble. A Wall Street Journal report last year quoted Christopher Harvey, head of equity strategy at Wells Fargo Securities, who said that the rise of AI gave a boost to the stock prices of established, blue-chip companies which are backed by strong fundamentals.\n\n\u201cWhat you\u2019re getting with these stocks is pristine balance sheets, stable earnings growth, mostly reasonable valuations, and you have that AI kicker,\u201d Harvey reportedly said.\n\nStory continues\n\nEnabling Tech Sector: Picks and Shovels for AI Technologies\n\nEarlier this month, UBS said in a report that the demand for cybersecurity and AI is expected to skyrocket in the future, which could boost the enabling tech subsector. Enabling technologies enable the development, production and deployment of technologies like AI. Many call tech enabling companies \"pick and shovel\" companies that power the IT infrastructure. According to UBS estimates, the enabling tech subsector is projected to grow to $1.2 trillion by 2025.\n\nUBS in its report listed nine tech enabling stocks that it believes can continue to grow through 2030. Best Tech Stocks for the Next 5 Years\n\nPhoto by Ruben Sukatendel on Unsplash Methodology\n\nFor this article we picked the nine stocks UBS recommended for the next few years through 2030 in its Global Equity Focus report mentioned above while the 10th stock in our list is backed by another expert recommendation by an analyst and a hedge fund manager. We ranked our list based on the number of hedge fund investors in these companies. Why hedge funds? Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\n10. Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 44\n\nChinese internet giant Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU) ranks 10th in our list of the best tech stocks to buy for the next five years. UBS said in its report highlighting top tech enablement stocks that a recovery in the ads market would bode well for Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU). UBS also said Baidu Inc's (NASDAQ:BIDU) PE valuation is \"undemanding\" and its non-ads business is among the growth drivers for the stock.\n\nInsider Monkey's database of 910 hedge funds shows that 44 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU). The most notable stakeholder of Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU)\u00a0during this period was Panayotis Takis Sparaggis's Alkeon Capital Management which owns a $332 million stake in Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU).\n\nAriel Global Fund made the following comment about Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cBy comparison, after a strong run last quarter, China\u2019s internet search and online community leader,\u00a0Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) declined alongside a correction in Chinese stocks attributed to weak gross domestic product. We believe this price action runs counter to the company\u2019s solid business fundamentals. Baidu delivered a top- and bottom-line earnings beat in the period, driven by a recovery in ad and cloud revenues. The company continues to invest heavily in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and is launching a generative AI, Ernie Bot, aimed at rivaling Open AI\u2019s ChatGPT. While monetization of the new technology is largely dependent on regulatory review, we think Baidu should continue to experience margin improvement with the ongoing implementation of efficiency and profitability initiatives. While some investors remain on the sidelines due to uncertainty surrounding China\u2019s economic growth, government regulations, and the political rhetoric towards Taiwan, we remain enthusiastic about Baidu\u2019s longer-term opportunity for revenue growth and margin expansion across internet search, cloud, autonomous driving, artificial intelligence and online video.\u201d\n\n9. ASML Holding NV (NASDAQ:ASML)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 57\n\nUBS is bullish on ASML Holding NV (NASDAQ:ASML), the Netherlands-based company that makes machines used in the development of semiconductors. UBS likes the stock due to the company's pricing power and high industry barriers. ASML Holding NV (NASDAQ:ASML)\u00a0recently posted fourth quarter results. Net profit in the quarter came in at 2.05 billion euros versus 1.86 billion euros expected. Net sales in the period jumped 12.5% year over year.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 57 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in ASML Holding NV (NASDAQ:ASML).\n\nLike ASML, analysts are also bullish on Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and\u00a0 Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM).\n\nClearBridge International Growth EAFE Strategy stated the following regarding ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cAnother welcome change has been the recognition of generative artificial intelligence (AI) opportunities for companies outside the U.S. While our IT holdings trailed their mega cap U.S. counterparts for most of the year, semiconductor equipment makers\u00a0ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) and Tokyo Electron, which we consider enablers of AI, as well as enterprise software maker SAP and IT consultant Accenture, which we see as facilitators of AI adoption in new product lines and/or enhanced business models, rose strongly in the quarter. These companies are rolling out new, AI-enhanced products at higher prices which should positively impact earnings in the near term. On an individual stock basis, the largest contributors to absolute returns in the quarter included ASML and Tokyo Electron in the IT sector.\u201d\n\n8. Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 81\n\nDespite cracks appearing in the EV industry amid regulation, costs and a declining interest from users, many analysts believe the future of the auto industry belongs to EVs. Cathie Wood, who has a five-year investment time horizon for her stock picks, continues to believe Tesla will soar in the next few years. In a latest program on CNBC, Wood said most car sales in the next five years would be electric. Cathie Wood believe Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock would reach $2000 by 2027. Famous investor Ron Baron, who founded Baron Capital, also believes Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock could hit $1,500 by 2030.\n\nTsai Capital Corporation stated the following regarding Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cTesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) ($248.48 \u2013 up 101.7% for the year. Recent high $299.29): Tesla has significant and underappreciated competitive advantages across multiple verticals including electric vehicles, software and energy storage. Misunderstood by much of Wall Street \u2013 and consequently a favorite of short sellers \u2013 Tesla continues to grow rapidly and increase its lead over the competition while delighting consumers in the process. Despite his unconventional (and sometimes off-putting) personality, Elon Musk is a visionary who has created enormous shareholder value. Musk is also a long-term thinker who has embraced the scale-economies-shared business model favored by Henry Ford and Jeff Bezos, intentionally reducing prices, increasing the customer value proposition and expanding the total addressable market. Tesla\u2019s massive scale and cost advantages are now challenging the viability of legacy auto, which has hundreds of billions of dollars of outdated property, plant and equipment in a world that is rapidly transitioning to electric vehicles (EVs). While we expect competition for EVs to intensify and for Tesla to lose market share over time, we also believe the company will increase production and deliveries from approximately 1.8 million vehicles today to approximately 15 million vehicles in 2030 and further its lead in autonomous driving capability. In fact, we expect Tesla will eventually license its autonomous driving software, creating high-margin (70-80%), recurring licensing revenue. Tesla is also one of only two companies that dominate the energy storage market, which has the potential to grow to several hundred billion in revenue as power plants around the world increase their focus on renewable energy. Our investment in Tesla is aligned with our preference for companies that have strong balance sheets and the managerial skill to reinvest capital at high rates of return into large addressable markets.\u201d\n\n7.

(NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWhile the ClearBridge Multi Cap Growth Strategy has limited mega cap exposure, which has been a recent headwind to relative performance, we own several companies that stand to benefit from the explosive growth in generative AI. These holdings play key roles in building out the necessary infrastructure and helping customers leverage capabilities enabled by this emerging technology.\n\nSemiconductor and software solutions provider\u00a0Broadcom Inc.

Time Is Not Your Friend.", "content": "The last time I wrote about QuantumScape (NYSE:QS), a developer of solid-state batteries for electric vehicles, was in May 2022. At the time, QS stock traded at $15. It\u2019s now less than half that.\n\nMy article discussed how nickel could become less important to produce these batteries. Interestingly, the metal could be replaced by iron, whose prices have remained far more stable than lithium and nickel over the past few years, not to mention much cheaper.\n\n\u201cThe latest price for nickel is $31,722 per ton, while a ton of iron ore is $142. Now, you don\u2019t have to be a rocket scientist to understand that if the battery could be more energy efficient while cheaper to produce, that\u2019s a win/win solution for QuantumScape,\u201d I wrote at the time.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGiven QuantumScape\u2019s rising costs then, I thought it could be an absolute game-changer. That was then, but this is now.\n\nAs InvestorPlace contributor Rich Duprey recently said, \u201cIf it loses its primary backer, the potential for QS stock is over.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve read nothing beyond 2022 about QuantumScape\u2019s use of iron instead of nickel, so I\u2019ll assume its management chose not to chase after the cheaper alternative.\n\nOnly big risk-takers ought to consider QuantumScape stock. Here\u2019s why.\n\nHow About Those Costs?\n\nQuantumScape\u2019s 2022 10-K shows that in the last three fiscal years, its operating losses have accelerated from $81.0 million in 2020 to $215.3 million in 2021 and $420.6 million in 2022. That\u2019s $717 million in losses over three years.\n\nThrough the first nine months of 2023, they were $354.4 million, so it looks like they\u2019ll be around $472 million for 2023, only slightly higher than a year ago.\n\nSo, it has slowed the losses, but they remain a significant concern given the timeline for commercializing its batteries seems further away every day. Duprey noted analysts believe meaningful revenues won\u2019t be had until 2027, with positive cash flow generation several years later.\n\nStory continues\n\nQuantumScape spent an average of 73.8% of its operating expenses on research and development over the past three years. That means it spent an average of 26.2% on general and administrative costs. In the nine months of 2023, it spent 71% of its operating expenses on R&D and 29% on G&A.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t appear to have aggressively cut its operating expenses.\n\nNo wonder Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VWAGY) is looking for other battery options. VW has trimmed its fat far more than QuantumScape in the past year. Further, it announced in December that the company and worker representatives worked out a plan to cut $11 billion in annual costs by 2026.\n\nIf QuantumScape isn\u2019t careful, it will be a part of that cost-cutting drive.\n\nWhy Not Buy BYD Instead?\n\nRealistically, unless you\u2019re in the business of venture capital investing, it\u2019s hard to understand why anyone other than the most seasoned risk-taker would place a bet on QuantumScape right now.\n\nI always like to discuss the idea of having options when investing. That\u2019s the beauty of it. You don\u2019t have to buy the first stock that comes along. You don\u2019t have to buy the sexy, shiny, exciting, mysterious pre-revenue stock.\n\nFor example, if batteries are your focus, why not consider putting a bet down on BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDY), the Chinese automotive company. It recently passed Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) as the world\u2019s top seller of EVs, producing 3.02 million new energy vehicles in 2023, considerably more than Elon\u2019s Musk\u2019s 1.84 million.\n\nOf course, there\u2019s a catch. BYD\u2019s number includes 1.4 million hybrids. Excluding those, Tesla led BYD by 240,000 battery-electric vehicles. However, BYD is coming on strong.\n\nIn early January, the company broke ground on constructing its new sodium-ion battery plant in Xuzhou, China. Investing $1.4 billion to build the plant, it will have a projected capacity of 30 gigawatt-hours.\n\nBefore you get too excited, the type of batteries that will be produced at the BYD plant are for small EVs and scooters, not larger SUV EVs.\n\nThe point, however, is that it\u2019s making plenty of battery investments without losing its shirt. Buy BYD until QuantumScape turns a corner. The risk/reward proposition is so much better.\n\nI would not buy it now if you don\u2019t own QS stock. If you own it, I would think long and hard about why you own it and whether it\u2019s worth it. For this reason, I\u2019d rate QS a Sell.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Its flagship Ark Innovation ETF soared 68%, easily outpacing the three major U.S. financial indexes. In positioning itself for 2024, the firm has 12.8% of its portfolio allocated to just two stocks: Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) accounts for 6.2% of invested assets, and Coinbase Global(NASDAQ: COIN) accounts for 6.6%.\n\nHere's what investors should know about these growth stocks.\n\n1. Tesla\n\nThe investment thesis for Tesla centers on its strong market presence in battery electric vehicles and its opportunities with adjacent artificial intelligence (AI) software and services. Tesla accounted for an industry-leading 19.2% of battery electric vehicle sales through November 2023. Price cuts have crushed its once industry-leading operating margin, but profitability should rebound as interest rates decline, Cybertruck production scales, and Tesla leans into software and services.\n\nSpecifically, management believes full self-driving (FSD) software will become the primary source of profitability over time. Tesla already sells FSD beta subscriptions in North America, and the product could launch in Europe by next summer. The company also plans to license its FSD software to third-party manufacturers. Numerous automakers have agreed to standardize around Tesla's charging network, and a similar outcome is plausible with its FSD software.\n\nAdditionally, Tesla will monetize FSD by providing robotaxi services, meaning it will launch an autonomous ride-hailing business at some point in the future. Management has not provided specific details, but the company is targeting volume production of a robotaxi this year. More information should be forthcoming during the next AI day event, presumably sometime in mid-2024.\n\nIn any case, Tesla is well positioned to be a leader in autonomous vehicle technology. Data is critical to training machine learning models, and the company has far more autonomous driving data than its peers. CEO Elon Musk believes Tesla's gross margin could trend toward 70%, up from about 20% today, as the company evolves toward software and services.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn that note, Ark Invest believes the robotaxi market could reach $9 trillion by 2030, but Wood and her team are not alone in making bold predictions. Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas believes software and services could push Tesla's addressable market to $10 trillion by 2030, and he expects the company to grow sales at 22% annually over the next eight years.\n\nShares of Tesla currently trade at 7.7 times sales, a discount to the three-year average of 14.7 times sales. That price looks reasonable if Tesla can indeed grow software and services revenue fast enough to meet Morgan Stanley's forecast, but valuing the stock based on that assumption is risky. Investors who believe Tesla could disrupt the mobility industry should consider buying a small position in the stock today. Investors who see Tesla as little more than a glorified automaker should avoid the stock.\n\n2. Coinbase Global\n\nThe investment thesis for Coinbase centers on its position as the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, international expansion efforts, and ability to diversify revenue beyond transaction fees and interest income.\n\nCoinbase has a reputation for security and reliability that has become more pronounced amid turmoil like the collapse of FTX. That brand authority allows the company to charge higher fees than many peers, and it has led to market share gains. Coinbase accounted for 6.8% of global cryptocurrency trading volume in September 2023, up from 4.9% in September 2022, making it the fourth-largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world.\n\nCoinbase primarily earns revenue through volume-based transaction fees and interest income on fiat currency held in reserve for stablecoin USDC. As such, the company depends heavily on trading volume and interest rates. In fact, those sources accounted for more than 85% of total revenue in the third quarter. Revenue from staking services is also climbing, but dependence on volume and interest rates is unlikely to change.\n\nWith that in mind, Coinbase continued to expand into new markets last year. The company launched its exchange in Brazil, Singapore, and Canada, and it obtained key licenses in Spain. Coinbase should continue to gain global market share as it moves into new geographies, and that should support growth in transaction revenue and interest income.\n\nAnother potential catalyst is the recent approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs. The Securities and Exchange Commission requires cash creations and redemptions, meaning the issuer must trade Bitcoin when shares are added or redeemed. Additionally, Coinbase is the custodian for eight of the 11 approved spot Bitcoin ETFs, meaning it will earn storage fees.\n\nGoing forward, Ark Invest believes the cryptocurrency market will be worth $20 trillion by 2030, implying more than 1,100% upside in the interim. Coinbase would undoubtedly benefit from that explosive growth, but investors should view that estimate skeptically. Cryptocurrency is a volatile asset class fraught with regulatory uncertainty.\n\nWall Street is less bullish. The consensus calls for Coinbase to grow revenue at about 2% annually over the next five years. That makes its current valuation of 10.4 times sales seem quite expensive. Personally, I would wait for a cheaper multiple before buying shares.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The company spent all of 2023 cutting prices to boost sales, which ate into profits.\n\nThe effectiveness of that strategy is waning, and executives cautioned they\u2019re approaching the limits of efforts to cut costs on the current vehicle lineup.\n\n\u201cTesla is signaling that the days of 50% or even 30% to 40% growth year-over-year is not going to happen in 2024,\u201d Seth Goldstein, a Morningstar Research analyst, said in an interview. \u201cAt a certain point, you can\u2019t cut prices anymore.\u201d\n\nIn a departure from past practice, Tesla avoided offering specific targets for the year ahead. The company fell well short of the 50% annual growth that management guided to in the past, despite slashing prices throughout 2023. Vehicle deliveries rose 38%, and analysts are predicting a 20% increase this year.\n\nTesla reported earnings of 71 cents a share for the fourth quarter, missing the 73-cents-a-share average estimate. The company generated $25.2 billion in revenue, less than the $25.9 billion predicted by Wall Street.\n\nMusk suggested this will all be temporary. Tesla is going to build its cheaper, next-generation vehicle as soon as the second half of next year at its factory in Austin, and then in Mexico. The company will also make the model at another site in North America. That could help the company appeal to more mass-market buyers who can\u2019t afford the company\u2019s existing EVs, which start at about $39,000 in the US.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cThat will be a challenging production ramp,\u201d Musk said of the next-generation vehicle. \u201cOnce it\u2019s going, it will be head and shoulders above any other manufacturing technology that exists anywhere in the world. It\u2019s next-level.\u201d\n\nUntil then, Tesla will try to reach new consumers with its existing lineup. Its newest vehicle, the Cybertruck, is rolling out gradually after launching in November. The company said that the ramp up of the stainless steel-clad pickup will be slower than other cars and hasn\u2019t given an annual sales forecast.\n\nNew products are of particular importance for Tesla because it has a fairly limited vehicle lineup. While sales of the Model Y sport utility vehicle and Model 3 sedan have soared, they still have relatively high sticker prices compared to China\u2019s BYD Co., the new EV leader. As high interest rates and inflation hit consumers\u2019 wallets last year, Tesla marked down its vehicles in dramatic fashion.\n\nThat put a damper on profitability. Tesla\u2019s automotive gross margin, excluding revenue from regulatory credits, came in at 17.2% for the quarter, a slight improvement from the lowest in over four years. Tesla has blamed the lower profitability on price cuts, higher spending on research and development and other expenses, including ramping up the Cybertruck.\n\nTesla faces stiff competition in the form of Chinese EV makers, which Musk said are \u201cthe most competitive car companies in the world.\u201d Chinese brands probably will succeed exporting abroad, he said, unless tariffs or other trade barriers are implemented to halt their advance. The CEO has witnessed the threat firsthand, with BYD overtaking Tesla as the world\u2019s top seller of EVs in the quarter.\n\n\u201cFrankly, I think if there are not trade barriers established, they will pretty much demolish most other car companies in the world,\u201d Musk said of China\u2019s automakers.\n\nMusk also elaborated on his plea for a 25% stake in Tesla to solidify his influence. The EV maker\u2019s board is unlikely to propose a new compensation plan for the CEO until a Delaware judge rules on a shareholder lawsuit regarding Musk\u2019s massive stock award approved in 2018.\n\n--With assistance from Amanda Matos, Catherine Larkin and Danny Lee.\n\n(Updates with early trading in the second paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nGoldman, Lazard Look to Ex-Spies to Gain an Edge in Volatile World How the West\u2019s Favorite Autocrat Engineered Africa\u2019s Most Dramatic Turnaround Stuck in a Downturn, Startups Ghost Investors It\u2019s the Tesla Earnings Call\u2014Time for Elon Musk Bingo Can America\u2019s New Union Hero Take on Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla?\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/musk-fails-convince-tesla-investors-091545249.html", "symbols": ["TL0.F", "TL0.XETRA", "TSLA.MX", "TSLA.US", "TSLA34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.969, "neg": 0.066, "neu": 0.838, "pos": 0.096}}, {"date": "2024-01-25T08:48:40+00:00", "title": "UPDATE 3-Norway's traffic regulator says it won't recall Tesla cars", "content": "(Adds details on decision in paragraphs 5 and 6, Tesla comment in paragraphs 7 and 9 and background in paragraphs 10-12)\n\nBy Marie Mannes\n\nSTOCKHOLM, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Norway's traffic safety regulator said on Thursday it had found no basis for ordering a recall of Tesla's S and X Model vehicles following an investigation into a suspension safety issue.\n\nThe Norwegian regulatory review was prompted by over a dozen customer reports to the agency in 2022 about suspension parts such as the rear lower control arm suddenly breaking.\n\n\"The Norwegian Public Roads Administration (NPRA) believes that a break in the rear lower control arm does not constitute an unacceptable risk, and that there is no basis for demanding a recall of the vehicles,\" the regulator said in a statement.\n\nIt will continue to monitor the situation, it said.\n\nNPRA said that the decision not to recall was made because the reported cases happened when the car was travelling at low speed, often when reversing.\n\nIt also said that the number of reported cases was low compared to the total number of S and X Models in Norway.\n\nTesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe company told the regulator in August it believed the probability of a severe issue with a compromised or broken rear lower control arm was low.\n\nSuch an error \"would not constitute any safety risk and hazard,\" it said in documents obtained by Reuters through a Freedom of Information Act request.\n\nThe news follows a\n\nReuters investigation\n\nin December which exposed how Tesla has blamed drivers for frequent failures of suspension and steering parts that it has long known were defective.\n\nTesla\n\nsubsequently said\n\nin a post on Musk's social media platform X that the report was \"riddled with incomplete and demonstrably incorrect information.\"\n\nThe Reuters investigation found that Tesla's control arm failures were a significant problem in Norway, one of the company's biggest European markets.

Last May, he acknowledged that BYD's cars were \"highly competitive.\" Then, in November, he suggested that the world's top ten automakers could end up being Tesla and nine Chinese carmakers.\n\nTesla, an early mover in the industry, faces intense competition from BYD. The Chinese EV maker took Tesla\u2019s crown as the world\u2019s top-selling EV brand in the final quarter of 2023. BYD sold 526,409 pure electric vehicles in the October-December period last year, about 40,000 more than Tesla over the same period.\n\nBeijing lavished manufacturing subsidies on the Chinese EV sector in a bid to develop a globally-competitive industry. That government support is now attracting scrutiny from lawmakers in the West.\n\nLast September, the European Commission launched an anti-subsidy probe into Chinese EV brands. A few months later, the Biden administration barred vehicles that used Chinese-made batter parts from being eligible for consumer tax credits. (Tesla sources some of its parts from CATL, a Chinese battery manufacturer).\n\nThe U.S. imposes a 25% levy on imported Chinese cars on top of a general 2.5% tariff on all auto imports. The Trump administration imposed the China-focused tariff, which the Biden administration has extended.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe European Union currently imposes a 10% tariff on imported vehicles. China also imposes import tariffs for foreign-made autos, depending on their place of origin.\n\nTesla faces an array of competitors in China, the world's largest EV market, not just from BYD, but also large automakers like GAC Group, startups like Nio and Xpeng, and even tech companies like phonemaker Xiaomi.\n\nThe U.S. carmaker helped to spark a price war in China at the start of 2023, and has continued to slash prices in a bid to capture market share. The U.S. carmaker again cut prices of its Model 3 and Model Y cars earlier this month.\n\nTesla did not give a full-year guidance target on Wednesday and warned of slower growth in the coming year.

On Wednesday, Musk warned Tesla was reaching \"the natural limit of cost down\" with its existing lineup.\n\nTesla plans to start producing a cheaper, mass market compact crossover codenamed \"Redwood\" mid-2025 to compete with inexpensive rivals, Reuters reported on Tuesday. Musk on Wednesday confirmed that Tesla expects to start production of its next-generation EV at its Texas factory in the second half of 2025.\n\nBut Chinese EV makers, adept at keeping costs in check with a stable supply chain, are moving fast. With rising competition and excess capacity in China, many are now working on rapidly expanding their foreign footprint after years of state subsidies helped boost domestic sales.\n\n\"The completeness and resilience of China's multi-decade state-directed battery materials processing infrastructure build out is biting hard,\" said Ross Gregory, a partner at Melbourne-based consultant New Electric Partners.\n\nStory continues\n\nChina's SAIC Motor, for instance, has been placing orders for more vehicle vessels in its fleet to counter shipping costs as it looks to boost sales overseas.\n\nStill, brand awareness of Chinese car companies in the United States is extremely low and their reliability, durability and safety is middling, so they have a long way to go to win U.S. market share, said Spencer Imel, a partner at consumer insights firm Lansgton.\n\n\"They enjoy high demand in China with innovation such as in-car technology and battery swapping,\" Imel said. \"That, we believe, will be an important ingredient and a differentiator in their future growth overseas.\"\n\nMusk's comments also come as the U.S. presidential election picks up pace. President Joe Biden has said China was determined to dominate the EV market and that he \"won't let that happen\".\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, who is the frontrunner for the Republican nomination for president this year, has signaled that he would double down on stronger tariffs if elected, calling for a universal 10% tariff on all imports into the U.S. and revoking China's most-favored-nation trading status.\n\nMusk on Wednesday said there was \"no obvious opportunity\" to partner with Chinese rivals but Tesla was open to giving them access to its charging network and licensing other technologies such as self-driving.\n\nEurope has also taken a protectionist stance towards Chinese EV makers. Last year, the European Commission launched an investigation into whether to impose punitive tariffs to protect EU producers against cheaper Chinese EV imports it says are benefiting from state subsidies.\n\nMore than tariffs, the U.S. and Europe need policies that will give their automakers the time to build a diversified supply chain, said New Electric's Gregory.

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) warns that sales growth will be \"notably lower\" this year, while Chief Executive Elon Musk details plans to roll out a new, cheaper model in 2025. Elsewhere, Boeing (NYSE:BA) shares dip premarket after the U.S. aviation regulator bans the planemaker from expanding production of its best-selling MAX family of jets.\n\n1. Futures subdued with data, earnings in focus\n\nU.S. stock futures hovered broadly around the flatline on Thursday, as investors awaited the release of key economic data and gauged a bevy of quarterly corporate results (see below).\n\nBy 05:00 ET (10:00 GMT), the S&P 500 futures contract had added 5 points or 0.1%, Nasdaq 100 futures were mostly unchanged, and Dow futures had inched up by 104 points or 0.3%.\n\nThe benchmark S&P 500 extended a recent rally on Wednesday, increasing by 0.1% to its fourth straight record close. Boosting the index were shares in Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), which surged after the streaming giant reported subscriber growth that smashed Wall Street expectations.\n\nSolid results from Dutch chipmaking equipment manufacturer ASML (AS:ASML) also fueled an uptick in semiconductor stocks, providing some lift to the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite. The 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average, meanwhile, dipped by about 0.3%.\n\n2. U.S. GDP ahead\n\nTraders will likely be paying close attention to the release of the key first reading of U.S. growth data for the fourth quarter, which could be an indicator of the health of the world's largest economy.\n\nEconomists are predicting that real gross domestic product (GDP) in the U.S. grew at a 2.0% annual rate in the final three months of last year, slowing from 4.9% in the third quarter.\n\nMarkets are hunting for any signs of the impact of a period of elevated interest rates on wider activity. A recent uptick in stocks has been partly fueled by hopes that the U.S. may be on course for a so-called \"soft landing\", in which the Federal Reserve's monetary policy tightening campaign successfully cools inflation without sparking a steep economic downturn.\n\nStory continues\n\nFed officials have moved to temper this optimism, suggesting that while such a scenario is becoming increasingly more conceivable, it is not yet an inevitability. The GDP figure may factor into how this outlook, although analysts at ING argued that the publication of the Fed's preferred measure of price growth on Friday will be \"far more important\" for rate-setters.\n\nWhile the Fed is widely tipped to keep borrowing costs on hold at more than two-decade highs of 5.25% to 5.50% at its next meeting later this month, the outcome of this week's data could determine how policymakers approach potential rate cuts this year.\n\n3. Tesla flags sales slowdown\n\nElon Musk's Tesla has warned that it expects to see \"notably lower\" sales growth in 2024 versus the prior year, as the electric vehicle giant faces intensifying competition and stalling demand from cost-conscious carbuyers.\n\nIn a presentation to shareholders, the company said it is currently \"between\" an initial growth wave sparked by the popularity of its Models 3 and Y, and a second that it believes will be initiated by a lower-cost, next-generation offering. Musk told analysts in a post-earnings call that the car is slated to begin production in the second half of 2025, adding that it will feature \"revolutionary manufacturing technology.\"\n\nMusk also flagged that margins \"will be good\" if interest rates come down quickly and \"won't be that good\" if they do not. \"[W]e don't have a crystal ball, so it's difficult for us to predict this with precision,\" he noted.\n\nTesla's stock price slipped in premarket U.S. trading on Thursday. Shares in major Chinese EV makers also fell after Musk warned that these groups would \"demolish\" their foreign rivals without trade barriers, feeding concerns over eventual export restrictions on the sector.\n\nTesla's announcement comes as several other big-name U.S. businesses are due to unveil their latest quarterly earnings. On Thursday, carriers American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) are set to report before the bell, while payments firm Visa (NYSE:V) and chipmaker Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) will post results after markets close in New York.\n\n4. FAA halts Boeing 737 MAX expansion\n\nThe U.S. aviation regulator has said that it will not let Boeing expand production of its 737 MAX jet, in the latest blow to the planemaker following a dangerous mid-air breach on its MAX 9 model earlier this month.\n\nShares in Boeing inched down premarket on Thursday.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement that the move, which will halt the output of one of Boeing's most popular line of planes, is needed to \"ensure accountability and full compliance\" by the company with quality control procedures. Fresh concerns have arisen around the safety of Boeing's planes after a non-fatal fuselage blowout on a MAX 9 operated by Alaska Airlines on Jan. 9.\n\nIt was still unclear how the FAA's decision would hit Boeing's production plans or its finances. The MAX fleet includes the MAX 8, a key source of revenue for Boeing.\n\nHowever, the FAA gave the green light for MAX 9 jets to return to skies once they have passed safety inspections.\n\n\"The exhaustive, enhanced review our team completed after several weeks of information gathering gives me and the FAA confidence to proceed to the inspection and maintenance phase,\" said FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker in a statement.\n\n5. Crude rises after U.S. inventories draw\n\nOil prices climbed higher Thursday, boosted by U.S. crude inventories falling more than expected last week as well as stimulus measures from top importer China.\n\nBy 05:00 ET, the U.S. crude futures traded 1.57% higher at $76.22 a barrel, while the Brent contract climbed 1.3% to $81.11 per barrel, trading once more above the widely-watched $80 a barrel level.\n\nU.S. crude stockpiles tumbled by a hefty 9.2 million barrels last week, according to the Energy Information Administration, but this figure was impacted by the harsh winter weather which shut in refineries and kept motorists off the road.\n\nOutput of U.S. crude fell from a record 13.3 million barrels per day two weeks ago to a five-month low of 12.3 barrels per day last week.\n\nElsewhere, the People\u2019s Bank of China on Wednesday unexpectedly cut reserve requirements for local banks, freeing up more liquidity in another attempt to foster economic growth in the world\u2019s largest oil importer.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nU.S. GDP ahead, Tesla warns of \"lower\" sales growth - what's moving markets\n\nHungary central bank says government lending rate plan is 'misguided'\n\nExclusive-India may keep 2024/25 gross borrowings close to current year's level - sources", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-gdp-ahead-tesla-warns-050843000.html", "symbols": ["AAL.US", "BA.MX", "BA.US", "BCO.F", "BCO.XETRA", "BOEI34.SA", "DJI.INDX", "INTC.US", "IXIC.INDX", "LUV.US", "NFLX.US", "TSLA.US", "V.US"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.392, "neg": 0.05, "neu": 0.895, "pos": 0.055}}, {"date": "2024-01-25T03:20:00+00:00", "title": "Dow Jones Futures: Stocks Slash Gains; Tesla Tumbles On Earnings, Elon Musk Comments", "content": "The stock market slashed intraday gains to close Wednesday mixed.

To be fair, the best growth companies adapted to higher interest rates and right-sized operations to enter 2024 stronger than before.\n\nBut value stocks remain overlooked despite being the perfect asset for a questionable recovery.\n\nBroadly speaking, value stocks are mature companies with demonstrated markets, quality products, consistent profitability, and quality cash flow. They usually offer a dividend, as well.

Critically, the company is a major backer of AST SpaceMobile\u2019s (NASDAQ:ASTS) satellite-based cell service venture that should see a commercial launch in 2024. But that isn\u2019t the only tailwind supporting AT&T\u2019s ascent in 2024.\n\nToday, the company posted its Q4 earnings report. While earnings fell below expectations, the report did shed light on solid growth. For example, wireless service revenue climbed nearly 4% year over year, indicating the company successfully navigated tight economic conditions to keep subscriber counts high while accounting for necessary price improvements. That\u2019s evident from AT&T\u2019s higher-than-expected postpaid phone net adds, which describes how many \u201cnew\u201d customers signed up for an AT&T plan. The quarterly stat hit 526,000 compared to 487,500 as anticipated. This figure is especially notable since the market is (thus far) fairly well saturated.\n\nHome Depot (HD) Flat cut-out image of house jammed into the crack of dry desert, symbolizing housing crisis\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Roman Bodnarchuk\n\nStory continues\n\nRenewed real estate optimism is setting Home Depot (NYSE:HD) up for a strong 2024.\n\nMoving forward, Home Depot plans to construct 80 new stores over the next five years. This expansion reflects management\u2019s expectation of increasing demand throughout the 2020s and positions the company to capitalize on the anticipated surge in renovations and new constructions.\n\nHome Depot\u2019s commitment to dividend growth is evident, with a consistent increase in its annual dividend over the past decade and a 50% higher distribution rate than five years ago. A payout ratio of 0.52 shows a balanced approach: rewarding shareholders while maintaining enough cash for business growth. A tad undervalued, Home Depot is one of the most stable value stocks available today.\n\nNintendo (NTDOY, NTDOF) A close-up shot of hands playing a video game on a mobile phone.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nA global gaming stock might not seem like a contender for top value stock status, but Nintendo (OTCMKTS:NTDOY, OTCMKTS:NTDOF) is truly unique. 2023 saw a slew of bullish Nintendo news that, if the trend continues, could create conditions for the stock\u2019s stratospheric rise in 2024.\n\nNintendo\u2019s big news came on the heels of the Super Mario Bros Movie success, which grossed $1.36 billion and highlighted what some of us have been saying is Nintendo\u2019s biggest strength \u2013 its largely untapped intellectual property catalog. That forecast bore fruit as the company announced an imminent Zelda movie on the heels of its prior success, creating an effective flywheel to monetize existing properties and drive new interests toward old products.\n\nFurther adding to Nintendo\u2019s appeal are leaked emails from a Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) court case, revealing Microsoft\u2019s substantial interest in either partnering with or acquiring Nintendo. These emails, dating back to 2020, may not have led to any tangible developments, but they underscore the significant corporate interest in Nintendo. This interest places Nintendo in a strong position to leverage its brand and assets for significant growth in 2024.\n\nNintendo also exhibits exceptional financial management, critical for any value stock consideration. Commended in the Microsoft emails for its sound management, the company boasts a significant cash reserve, ensuring its ability to weather economic uncertainties and seize emerging opportunities. With a current total yield of 2.57%, Nintendo is particularly attractive to value investors, offering a stable return while they await the stock\u2019s imminent repricing.\n\nMedtronic (MDT) Medtronic (MDT) sign outside office building representing healthcare stocks\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nMedtronic (NYSE:MDT), a leading medical device manufacturer and blue-chip healthcare stock, stands out as an excellent choice for value investors interested in healthcare. Despite a relatively flat performance for most of 2023, the stock popped in 2024 and returned 2.75% since the year began. Looking forward, the company\u2019s prospects far surpass its current modest performance, presenting an attractive entry point for investors.\n\nThe latest earnings report from Medtronic reveals a solid growth trajectory post-pandemic, a contrast to many healthcare stocks, with a staggering 112%% increase in GAAP earnings year-over-year. The company\u2019s commitment to innovation, coupled with its deep value characteristics, indicates significant potential for upside.\n\nA key aspect of Medtronic\u2019s future growth lies in its foray into artificial intelligence in healthcare. The early 2023 collaboration with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) to develop AI-driven platform solutions should see widespread market adoption by 2024. This development is promising for investors who have remained patient through the stock\u2019s recent period of stagnation.\n\nAdditionally, Medtronic\u2019s current dividend yield of 3.2% further cements its position as an attractive value stock. It offers a blend of stability and potential for growth, making it a compelling investment for 2024.\n\nSturm Ruger (RGR) a photo of some guns and ammunition\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nGun sales tend to surge in election years. Sturm Ruger (NYSE:RGR) is a value stock ready to capitalize on the trend. Trading at a meager 13x earnings, 2x book value, and 1.4x sales, this small-cap value stock is set for a solid run in 2024.\n\nThe company struggled in 2023 because, in the words of CEO Christopher Kilroy, \u201cOur third quarter sales and profitability decreased from last year, as overall firearms demand declined, creating a challenging, promotion-rich marketplace.\u201d\n\nBut gun sales hit an all-time high in 2020 amid the election, more than doubling the rate in 2012 during President Obama\u2019s second run. Good, bad, or indifferent \u2013 political motivations shouldn\u2019t sway investor opinion. However, when it comes to making money, RGR is poised to pop as we enter yet another contentious election season.\n\nH&R Block (HRB) H&R block storefront in Canada. HRB stock.\n\nSource: TippyTortue / Shutterstock\n\nAs tax season approaches, H&R Block (NYSE:HRB) emerges as another value stock poised for growth. Last year, the company faced uncertainties due to rumors about the IRS potentially launching a free national tax filing service. However, HRB has since made a remarkable recovery and is now strategically positioned to dominate the tax return sector and explore additional revenue streams.\n\nHRB launched a mobile banking service at the year\u2019s start to counteract the seasonal nature of its tax-related revenue. By April 2023, this initiative had garnered substantial customer interest, with 291,000 users and over $280 million in deposits. Additionally, HRB\u2019s small-business accounting service saw a 10% increase in year-over-year revenue. These strategic diversifications indicate a strong commitment to stabilizing cash flow, a typical challenge for tax-centric companies aiming for a more consistent revenue stream year-round.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) Image of General Motors (GM) logo on corporate building with clear sky in the background.\n\nSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com\n\nGeneral Motors (NYSE:GM) skillfully navigated 2023\u2019s labor disputes while maintaining profitability, making it among the best value stocks when it comes to car companies. Though the labor deal will likely exceed $9 billion, GM also announced a $10 billion stock buyback and a 33% increase in its dividend in its end-of-year earnings announcement. This strategy elevates GM\u2019s total yield to $5.34, an impressive figure, especially considering that its shares have fallen nearly 10% in the past six months. This decline positions GM as an underpriced value stock with unlimited upside.\n\nThe long-term outlook for GM is optimistic, particularly in the electric vehicle (EV) sector. The company has reported a 33% YoY increase in EV sales. With six EV models currently available and more in development, GM is steadily establishing itself as a significant contender in the EV market, despite still lagging behind Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).\n\nThe broad automotive sector does seem a bit rocky, still, and EV popularity is on a downswing. Despite these uncertainties, this undervalued car company emerges as a top choice among 2024\u2019s value stocks and one of the best within the EV sector (besides, of course, Musk\u2019s crown jewel).\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

Musk has said that without at least a 25% stake in the company, he\u2019ll build AI and robotics products elsewhere. He spent much of the earnings call talking about these new opportunities rather than the slowing growth and shrinking profit margins of its predominant EV business.\n\nMusk said Wednesday one way to get his stake to 25% could be to create a dual class of shares akin to those at companies like Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc.

This echoes what Reuters reported earlier, that Tesla told suppliers it wants to start production of a new mass-market EV codenamed \"Redwood\" in mid-2025.\n\nTesla's drop in profitability is likely due to downward pressure on margins since Tesla began its cost-cutting efforts late in 2022. Tesla reported Q4 gross margin of 17.6% vs 18.1% estimated, a big drop versus a year ago and a sequential decline from the 17.9% achieved in Q3.\n\nStory continues\n\nHeadlines like rental car firm Hertz shedding thousands of EVs, Tesla cutting prices in China, a two-week production halt in Berlin, and CEO Elon Musk's ill-timed demand for more stock have also weighed on Tesla.\n\nEarlier this month Tesla reported 484,507 deliveries in Q4, beating Street estimates of 483,173, per Bloomberg. That figure represents an all-time record quarter for Tesla, nearly 20,000 units higher than its past record quarter of 466,000 units delivered in Q2 of last year.\n\nFor the year, Tesla said vehicle deliveries grew 38% year over year to 1.81 million and production grew 35% year over year to 1.85 million. While its 38% delivery growth rate was below its 50% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) target, Tesla previously said it would not attain that goal due to factory shutdowns and improvements that occurred in Q3.\n\nAlso of note are Cybertruck deliveries. Tesla did not break out this total in its Q4 delivery update, though the company did say the Cybertruck production ramp would take longer than other models. \"[Cybertruck] demand is off the hook,\" Musk said on the call, repeating similar comments that made last year.

(Mike Blake/REUTERS/File Photo) (Reuters / Reuters)\n\nMusk also addressed his comments from last week claiming that he would need to secure greater control of Tesla if the company is going to meet its wide-reaching AI ambitions.\n\nMusk said on the earnings call that his concern would be, given his current shareholding, that he will have \"so little influence\" in the future that some major shareholder could strip away his control, or make a bad decision.

Earnings Per Share (EPS): Diluted GAAP EPS for Q4 stood at $2.27, marking a substantial rise from the previous year. Free Cash Flow: Free cash flow was strong at $2.1 billion in Q4, contributing to a total of $4.4 billion for the year. Operational Efficiency: Cost of goods sold per vehicle declined sequentially in Q4, showcasing Tesla's focus on cost efficiencies.

Energy Storage: Energy storage deployments doubled YoY, reaching 14.7 GWh in 2023.\n\nOn January 24, 2024, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) released its 8-K filing, detailing the company's financial performance for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023. Tesla, known for its electric vehicles, solar panels, and energy storage solutions, has once again demonstrated its ability to grow and maintain profitability amidst a challenging economic landscape. Tesla Inc (TSLA) Posts Record Vehicle Deliveries and Strong Profitability in 2023 Earnings\n\nFiscal Summary and Company Overview\n\nFor the year 2023, Tesla reported a total revenue of $96.8 billion, a 19% increase from the previous year. The company's GAAP net income for the year was $15.0 billion, with $7.9 billion recorded in the fourth quarter alone, largely due to a one-time non-cash tax benefit of $5.9 billion. This benefit was related to the release of a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets. Tesla's diluted GAAP EPS for Q4 was $2.27, and for the full year, it was $4.30, marking a 19% increase YoY.\n\nFounded in 2003 and headquartered in Palo Alto, California, Tesla has established itself as a leader in the electric vehicle and clean energy industry. The company's mission to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy is supported by its integrated approach, which includes the production and sale of electric vehicles, solar energy generation, and energy storage products. Tesla's vehicle lineup includes luxury and midsize sedans, crossover SUVs, and it plans to expand with more affordable models, a light truck, a semi-truck, and a sports car. In 2023, Tesla delivered over 1.3 million vehicles globally.\n\nStory continues\n\nOperational Highlights and Challenges\n\nTesla's operational achievements in 2023 were significant, with Model Y becoming the best-selling vehicle globally. The company's energy storage deployments saw a 125% growth, reaching 14.7 GWh. Tesla also reported a gross profit increase in its Services & Other business, turning around from a $500 million loss in 2019 to a $500 million profit in 2023.\n\nDespite these achievements, Tesla faced challenges, including a reduction in vehicle average selling price (ASP) due to pricing adjustments and mix changes. The company also experienced increased operating expenses, partly driven by AI and other R&D projects. Additionally, the cost of the Cybertruck production ramp was noted as a factor impacting profitability.\n\nFinancial Performance Analysis\n\nTesla's financial performance in 2023 reflects its ability to scale operations while pursuing cost efficiencies. The company's focus on reducing the cost of goods sold per vehicle has paid off, with a sequential decline in Q4. Tesla's strong free cash flow of $4.4 billion for the year, despite its highest capital expenditures and R&D expenses in company history, underscores its financial discipline and commitment to growth.\n\nThe company's balance sheet remains robust, with a $3.0 billion increase in cash and investments in Q4 to $29.1 billion. This financial strength positions Tesla well for future growth initiatives and navigating economic uncertainties.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nTesla's outlook for 2024 includes a focus on launching the next-generation vehicle platform at Gigafactory Texas, which may result in a lower vehicle volume growth rate compared to 2023. However, the company expects the growth rate of deployments and revenue in its Energy Storage business to outpace the Automotive business. Tesla also anticipates maintaining a strong balance sheet and sufficient liquidity to fund its product roadmap and long-term capacity expansion plans.\n\nFor value investors and potential GuruFocus.com members, Tesla's latest earnings report highlights the company's resilience and strategic focus on innovation and cost management. The continued growth in vehicle deliveries and energy storage deployments, coupled with strong profitability, suggests that Tesla remains well-positioned for sustainable long-term growth.\n\nFor more detailed analysis and insights on Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) and other investment opportunities, visit GuruFocus.com.\n\nExplore the complete 8-K earnings release (here) from Tesla Inc for further details.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-inc-tsla-posts-record-225430663.html", "symbols": ["TL0.F", "TL0.XETRA", "TSLA.MX", "TSLA.US", "TSLA34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.999, "neg": 0.014, "neu": 0.788, "pos": 0.198}}, {"date": "2024-01-24T22:45:21+00:00", "title": "The Earnings Call Is Underway.

The RRR dictates the amount of capital reserves that need to be held by Chinese banks, with the cut now freeing up more liquidity to be injected into the economy.\n\nThe PBOC also flagged more measures in the pipeline to help shore up economic growth- the clearest sign so far that Beijing planned to deploy more stimulus. The signals helped Chinese markets rebound from multi-year lows, after weakening economic growth spurred massive capital outflows from regional markets.\n\nHong Kong gains stymied by EV losses after Tesla Q4 disappointment\n\nHong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index rose 0.6%, also extending a rebound from 15-month lows. But bigger gains on the index were held back by losses in heavyweight electric vehicle stocks, which fell tracking disappointing fourth-quarter earnings from major Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA).\n\nHong Kong shares of Chinese EV makers NIO Inc (HK:9866), Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI) Inc (HK:2015) and Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV) Inc (HK:9868) sank between 5% and 8%, while those of BYD (HK:1211), which is a key competitor of Tesla, fell 3.5%.\n\nTesla\u2019s earnings ramped up concerns over slowing demand for EVs, with the carmaker also flagging weaker sales and production growth in 2024. The forecast also heralded more price cuts from the EV major, which is expected to further dent profit margins in the sector.\n\nStory continues\n\nBroader Asian markets clocked some gains. Australia\u2019s ASX 200 rose 0.4%, tracking optimism over China, while futures for India\u2019s Nifty 50 index pointed to a positive open after the index rebounded 1% on Wednesday.\n\nStill, bigger gains outside China were restrained by increased caution ahead of a European Central Bank meeting, as well as key U.S. fourth-quarter GDP data due later in the day. The data also comes just days before the Federal Reserve\u2019s first meeting in 2024, where the central bank is expected to reiterate its higher-for-longer stance on interest rates.\n\nAmong decliners for the day, South Korea\u2019s KOSPI fell 0.6% even as data showed GDP grew slightly more than expected in the fourth quarter. But the overall pace of growth remained weak.\n\nJapan sees more profit-taking after BOJ talks pivot\n\nJapan\u2019s Nikkei 225 fell 0.2%, while the broader TOPIX index was flat as investors continued to collect profits from the two recently reaching 34-year highs.\n\nA recent rally in Japanese markets was cut short after Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda offered the clearest signals yet that the central bank will eventually pivot away from its ultra-dovish policy. While he offered scant cues on the timing of a pivot, his comments were sufficient in making investors pause a recent run in Japanese shares.\n\nUpgrade your investing with our groundbreaking, AI-powered InvestingPro+ stock picks.

This compares to earnings of $1.19 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -5.33%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this electric car maker would post earnings of $0.72 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.66, delivering a surprise of -8.33%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.\n\nTesla , which belongs to the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, posted revenues of $25.17 billion for the quarter ended December 2023, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.97%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $24.32 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nTesla shares have lost about 15.8% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 2%.\n\nWhat's Next for Tesla?\n\nWhile Tesla has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nStory continues\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Tesla: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.85 on $26.56 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $3.77 on $117.47 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well.

The economy continues to improve and it may very well be that we entirely avoid a recession.

Employers and employees continue to move away from traditional workplace norms which has opened an opportunity for Freelancers and other gig economy workers. The result is that Fiverr International is experiencing reasonable growth and is expected to double this year.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFiverr International\u2019s platform covers 10 verticals and more than 600 categories connecting freelancers to projects on every corner of the globe. Fiverr International is a fundamentally strong firm which is a prime reason to consider investing in its stock.\n\nThe company\u2019s top-line growth eclipsed 12% during the third quarter. That clearly doesn\u2019t place the company in the realm of hypergrowth stocks but what the company has going in its favor is profitability. During the third quarter the company reported positive net income. The company also reported positive net income two quarters prior. It\u2019s clear that FIverr International is on the precipice of sustained profitability which bodes well for the company and is a positive reflection on the continued growth of the gig economy overall.\n\nStory continues\n\nMatch Group (MTCH) MTCH stock: the Match group logo on a computer screen with a phone displaying its site\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock\n\nMatch Group (NASDAQ:MTCH) is the leading online dating apps stock and one that is widely expected to double in 2024. Consensus forecasts anticipate that the company will increase in value by more than 35% over the course of the next 12 to 18 months. However, more bullish forecasts anticipate that MTCH shares will more than double over that time period.\n\nThe company oversees a portfolio of dating apps and companies including Match, Tinder, OkCupid and Hinge among others. The company is undergoing a period of transition that could Propel its shares higher. Match Group has installed a new CEO in Faye Iosotaluno. Iosotaluno intends to leverage AI and other technologies in an effort to turn around the company which has been without a full-time CEO since 2022.\n\nThe company is also linked to recent investment from Elliott Management to the tune of $1 billion. It\u2019s likely that increased fees could result from the investment which in turn promises to improve the company\u2019s flagging results.\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) CELH stock: A view of several cases of Celsius energy drinks, on display at a local big box grocery store.\n\nSource: The Image Party / Shutterstock\n\nCelsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) has rapidly evolved into one of the most interesting beverage stocks. While there is a slim likelihood that its shares double in 2024 that does remain a distinct possibility. However, investors should simply consider Celsius Holdings due to the fundamental strength of the brand and its recent growth.\n\nThe company sells so-called functional drinks which are generally very low calorie and include substantial vitamin and mineral content. Those beverages have garnered a large audience which is evidenced by the fact that the company reported $385 million of product sales in the third quarter. That was an all-time high for the company and represented a 104% increase overall.\n\nOf the company\u2019s $385 million in Q3 revenues, $371 million were attributable to the North American market. That fact alone should provide some insight into its future potential. There is a large untapped international market for its beverages.\n\nFurthermore, Celsius Holdings has reached profitability in 2023 after reporting substantial losses throughout 2022.\n\nAlbemarle (ALB) Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com\n\nAlbemarle (NYSE:ALB) stock has all the potential in the world to double in 2024. In fact, ALB shares are forecast to more than triple based on the high analyst target price given on Wall Street.\n\nDemand for lithium however has been weak for months. As a result, the share prices of major lithium producers including Albemarle continue to be very low. It\u2019s here that a contrarian mindset could pay huge dividends. Speaking of dividends, Albemarle is a reasonable choice in that regard. The company is a well-known dividend aristocrat and provides a dividend currently yielding 1.3%.\n\nSome pundits expect that lithium prices could rebound this year. Meanwhile, Albemarle is restructuring and intends to reduce capital expenditures in the near term. The news slightly negatively affected the price but the greater truth is that Albemarle is the largest lithium producer globally. It is a near certainty that it will rebound in price beginning sometime this year and into 2025. The only reason to realistically bet against that is under the premise that the electric vehicle industry fails entirely.\n\nLi Auto (LI) Li Auto electric car retail store with customers. Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nLi Auto (NASDAQ:LI) Is one of the strongest challengers to Tesla\u2019s (NASDAQ:TSLA) dominance within the EV sector. Simply put, Li Auto is something of an outlier in that it is operating very well amidst a greater downturn. Electric vehicle manufacturers are currently facing delays and value dilution. While the sector is at a seminal juncture, Li Auto continues to thrive.\n\nRevenues increased by 271% during the most recent quarter and the company is profitable. That truth differentiates it from domestic rivals and also makes it an interesting competitor to tesla.\n\nIn fact, the company has outsold Tesla in its home market of China during recent periods. That\u2019s particularly positive given the strong reception of electric vehicles in China. The country is home to the largest EV market globally and one that is also marked by strong growth rates overall. China also continues to offer a favorable subsidy environment for electric vehicles that benefits the company and its continued growth.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia corporation (NVDA) logo displayed on smartphone with stock market chart background. Nvidia is a global leader in artificial intelligence hardware and software\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile it may seem strange to assert that Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock has the potential to double in 2024 following its historic year in 2023, that is indeed the case. Analysts on Wall Street believe that the AI leader\u2019s shares could rise to $1,100 in 2024.\n\nOne reason to believe that that may be the case lies in recent announcements from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM). The company, which operates the largest foundry globally, announced that it expects revenues to increase by 20% in 2024. The company produces more than half of chips globally and is a major partner of Nvidia. The news suggests that demand for Nvidia\u2019s chips could be very strong this year.\n\nMeanwhile, Nvidia will release its updated h200 chip in 2024. That chip will improve upon its h100 chip which is extremely popular. It all points to the notion that Nvidia\u2019s historic run in 2023 may have only been in the beginning.\n\nBloom Energy (BE) An image of hydrogen fuel silos standing against a blue sky\n\nSource: Audio und werbung / Shutterstock\n\nBloom Energy (NYSE:BE) is an attractive choice in the growing hydrogen economy. The stock represents a company that manufactures and sells onsite power generation platforms that can run on hydrogen.\n\nIt\u2019s also a stock that has the potential to more than double based on Wall Street\u2019s expectations. The company and its stock are certainly worth looking at on the basis of pure fundamentals. Revenues increased by more than 37% during the most recent period, rising above $400 million.\n\nMeanwhile, Bloom Energy cut its operating losses in half, falling from $103.7 million to $51.1 million during the same period.\n\nThe hydrogen economy will come into sharper focus in the coming years. When burned, hydrogen produces no carbon dioxide. Further, the production of hydrogen produces relatively less greenhouse gas.\n\nImportantly, Bloom Energy is becoming relatively established in relation to its stock price. Its ability to produce massive revenues have propelled its shares out of penny stock territory and into a much more stable position.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

We have our eyes on electric vehicles, starting with Tesla. The EV maker is telling suppliers to start mass market production of a new crossover car, that's according to a report from Reuters. And this comes ahead of the car maker releasing its Q4 earnings today after the bell.\n\nNow this is interesting, the fact that they're announcing this, when we know there's going to be a lot of focus, of course, on margins and, of course, delivery estimates as well for Tesla, as well as really some questions about leadership going forward, especially in light of Elon Musk asking for that 25% voting control here.\n\nBut interesting after all this time to finally see what's supposed to be a mid-priced crossover SUV vehicle that's supposed to be around $25,000. So really competing with some of that pressure that we've seen them taking from BYD.\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, I mean, that's the key, right? $25,000 price tag, well below what the cheapest car that Tesla has on the market right now, which is the Model 3, roughly at $38,000 at a time when Tesla was overtaken by BYD as the largest EV maker.\n\nNow the pricing issue is certainly going to come up in the earnings call, no question, because Tesla has had to undergo multiple price cuts to remain competitive in this market. But Rachelle, this isn't just about the Tesla story. You could argue that what we have learned in the slowdown that we have seen in EV sales is that this next round of buyers-- if you want to talk about the first adopters, already underway-- this next round, they're looking for a cheaper option.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd there is a concern, yes, about infrastructure, but there is a concern about price tag. Right now, Tesla's cars don't necessarily apply for federal subsidies. And so you take that out, you've got a $38,000 car at a time when there are cheaper options like a Kia out there, they've got to just sort of face the reality of where things are.\n\nYou could argue also the other thing, Rachelle, you've been sort of teasing out, right, is that this may be an anticipation of this expectation that BYD is going to increasingly compete on a bigger level outside of its home market. Questions about whether they're going to enter the US market. But Tesla's going to have a cheaper option if they're going to go head to head with BYD.\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: Indeed. And I think especially when you think of also the resale value of Teslas and other EVs, that's also sort of another thing that people worry about. And then, of course, Hertz releasing that fleet of some of their rental cars up for sale as well, also sort of messing with some of the pricing as well, trying to really get a gauge on what people consider the right price point for this second round of adopters, as you mentioned, Akiko.\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: Yes. Another question to come up in the Tesla earnings call, I'm sure. Well, staying in the battery-powered lane, a Baird analyst is initiating coverage of Nikola, the firm rating the EV maker as outperform with a $2 price target. The analysts saying, there's opportunity to capitalize on the zero emissions trucking space, but take a look at that share price, Rachelle.\n\nWe're talking about this company trading below that $1 level, now facing delisting from the NASDAQ yet again, because they have been trading below that $1 a share level for more than 30 consecutive days. So sure, you can make the argument about Nikola having this stronger runway here, as Baird has, but you have to wonder about the viability of a company that's trading at $0.70 a share.\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: I mean, it's true. It's one of these stocks that you keep waiting for it to take off and have its moment.

But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.\n\nEveryone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.\n\nCurrently, both General Motors Company and Tesla are holding a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy). Investors should feel comfortable knowing that both of these stocks have an improving earnings outlook since the Zacks Rank favors companies that have witnessed positive analyst estimate revisions. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.\n\nValue investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.\n\nOur Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.\n\nGM currently has a forward P/E ratio of 4.56, while TSLA has a forward P/E of 55.44. We also note that GM has a PEG ratio of 0.59. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. TSLA currently has a PEG ratio of 2.94.\n\nAnother notable valuation metric for GM is its P/B ratio of 0.62. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, TSLA has a P/B of 12.26.\n\nThese are just a few of the metrics contributing to GM's Value grade of A and TSLA's Value grade of C.\n\nStory continues\n\nBoth GM and TSLA are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that GM is the superior value option right now.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But as closely tied as the man is to the company and its $700-billion-dollar valuation, there is one thing he doesn\u2019t have that some of his other tech industry peers enjoy: more control.\n\nLast week, Musk publicly demanded that Tesla\u2019s board give him even greater influence over the company by boosting his stake to 25%, or else he\u2019d continue to develop artificial intelligence tech somewhere else.\n\nMusk, the richest person in the world, was quick to point out that this wasn\u2019t about the money. Rather, he was pushing for greater decision-making power. In fact, he even floated the idea of receiving another class of shares that would grant him more votes without diluting existing Tesla shares or forcing the company to hand over billions of dollars in extra compensation.\n\nThe dual-class share model is one enjoyed by Musk\u2019s frequent rival, Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who commands control of his company through super-voting stock. It appears Musk wants what Zuckerberg has. But a look at the arrangement shows the limits of unchecked executive control and the double-edged nature of creating unequal voting rights. Musk warned last week that for him to steer Tesla to become a global leader in artificial intelligence and robotics, he'd need even greater sway over the company's decisions. (STR/NurPhoto via Getty Images) (NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nHistorically, companies used dual-class structures in certain sectors, including the so-called vice industries, like alcohol and tobacco, to guard against corruption, and in situations where families vied for legacy control over the whims of short-term interests, most notably in publicly traded newspapers like the New York Times (NYT).\n\nBut in recent decades, younger companies have increasingly adopted the structure.\n\nSuper-voting arrangements have grown on the belief that the success of early-stage enterprises are bound up with the founders themselves, whose vision, drive, and leadership are intrinsic to the worth of the company. That startups tend to heavily rely on equity-linked compensation is another reason proponents of dual-class structures use them. Since managers and their employees are also major shareholders, the leaders\u2019 incentives are aligned with lifting the stock price, keeping their employees motivated and working in their own self-interest to accumulate wealth. For dual-class backers, the setup keeps the people best equipped to make strategic decisions in charge, while granting them access to more capital, all without diluting their influence.\n\nStory continues\n\nIPOs in the tech industry using dual-class shares have been on the upswing, according to data compiled by Jay Ritter, a finance professor at the University of Florida. Over the last 10 years, the percent of tech IPOs with dual-class structures has averaged about 36%, up from the prior decade of about 22%, the data shows.\n\n\u201cInvestors are relatively complacent with dual-class stock with tech companies because in the US, on average, public market investors have done well,\u201d Ritter said, pointing to notable dual-class examples including Meta and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), whose stock prices have more than doubled in recent years. From 1980 to 2020, companies that used dual-class shares have outperformed single-class stocks, offering returns of roughly 30% versus 19% respectively, according to Ritter's data, which averaged three-year buy and hold returns from the closing price of the IPO.\n\nThe success stories, however, can turn on themselves. Propping up shareholder managers who hold the majority of voting shares leaves companies with weaker institutional checks on executive power. When the stock is up, a less constrained leader can be a good thing. But when prospects are sinking, there's little recourse for investors to course correct if they are relegated to a voting minority.\n\nA key criticism of dual-class shares is that they downgrade shareholders to second-class status, said Jun Frank, managing director at ISS-Corporate. Founders and insiders can maintain significant control with much less capital at stake. And the structure reduces the level of influence the public can have on a company, he said.\n\nFinancial arrangements that grant executives outsized power can also attract harsh scrutiny. Part of WeWork's spectacular IPO implosion in 2019 was tied to corporate governance issues and the multiple-class shares that gave then-executive Adam Neumann tremendous voting sway. Uber (UBER), the ride-hailing giant, dispensed with its super-voting share structure in the wake of its widely covered scandals and the eventual ouster of former CEO and co-founder Travis Kalanick in 2017.\n\nThe long-term risks of founders and early investors wielding heavy decision-making power are recognized even among companies that use dual-class shares. An increasing amount of such companies are relying on sunset provisions that phase out multiple-class shares when certain trigger conditions are met, typically when the founder leaves the company. In 2023, about 52% of Russell 3000 companies with dual-class structures also had sunset clauses, according to data from ISS-Corporate. That's up from 44% in 2021.\n\nBut a relatively weak executive can pose other dangers, as Musk sees in Tesla's current structure.\n\nHis stake in the company leaves the carmaker open to takeovers \"by dubious interests,\" he said on X. But with a boosted share count, he'd still have checks on his power while giving him enough heft to protect the company. \"If I have 25%, it means I am influential, but can be overridden if twice as many shareholders vote against me vs for me,\" he said.\n\nFor as much control as he already exercises, there's still room for more.\n\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.\r\n\r\nTop 5 Upgrades:\n\nMacquarie upgraded Netflix (NFLX) to Outperform from Neutral with a price target of $595, up from $410. Netflix reported \"excellent\" Q4 results and outlook as its efforts to boost subscribers, revenue and earnings are bearing fruit, the firm says. New Street upgraded AMD (AMD) to Buy from Neutral with a $215 price target after analyzing the possibility of $400B being spent on artificial intelligence chips in 2027. AMD is the best way to play a fast adoption scenario of AI chips, with the most valuation and expectation upside, the firm tells investors in a research note. Daiwa upgraded Verizon (VZ) to Outperform from Neutral with a price target of $47, up from $36. The firm has a \"positive impression\" of the company's Q4 given the strength in Verizon's core business and the 2024 guidance.  JMP Securities upgraded Squarespace (SQSP) to Outperform from Market Perform with a $40 price target. The firm says Google Domains make its 2024 estimate appear conservative, international localization and pricing is a tailwind, and industry-wide rationalization increases confidence that Squarespace's margins can expand.  UBS upgraded First Horizon(FHN) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $16, up from $15.50. UBS thinks First Horizon is well positioned to return capital to shareholders given their strong capital position, near-TBV stock valuation and management's stated goals of deploying excess capital above 11% CET1.\n\nTop 5 Downgrades:\n\nDeutsche Bank downgraded Netflix (NFLX) to Hold from Buy with a price target of $525, up from $460. While the firm acknowledges that the decision to downgrade \"was a difficult one\" as it increased earnings and free cash flow estimates, it says that Netflix's leadership position is fully priced into the stock at these levels.  Gordon Haskett downgraded Uber Technologies(UBER) to Hold from Buy with a $66 price target. Uber deserves to trade at a premium to peers, but its catalysts are now well appreciated, and Street incremental EBITDA margin estimates are sitting well above the company's long-term target, the firm says.  UBS downgraded Biogen (BIIB) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $276, down from $311. The firm is moving to the sidelines as the Leqembi ramp is progressing slower than expected, and is not expecting a major sales inflection in 2024 based on a review of the latest IQVIA/Symphony data and management commentary.  Barclays downgraded Thermo Fisher(TMO) and Danaher (DHR) to Equal Weight from Overweight with price targets of $555 and $240, up from $475 and $215, respectively. Given the recent run in shares, stocks trade at or above historical premiums to the market, leaving little room for more multiple expansion, the firm argues.  Morgan Stanley downgraded Epam Systems(EPAM) to Underweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $250, up from $235. The firm says more pricing pressure, slower budget growth and lower venture capital investment will likely make a return to Epam's previous growth rates difficult.\n\nTop 5 Initiations:\n\nRedburn Atlantic initiated coverage of Tesla (TSLA) with a Sell rating and $170 price target Tesla has largely retained its technical leadership in electrical architectures, offering scale advantages and lower unit costs, but its valuation \"appears indifferent to margin pressure from pricing and rising capital needs,\" says Redburn.  Redburn Atlantic initiated coverage of General Motors(GM) with a Neutral rating and $40 price target and Ford (F) with a Sell rating and $10 price target as the firm launched coverage of nine automotive original equipment manufacturers, with a \"cautious bias\" driven by falling incremental returns.  Bernstein initiated coverage of Polestar Automotive(PSNY) with an Underperform rating and $1.15 price target. The firm says it loves the innovative asset-light strategy and the cars, but doesn't think the company should be a stand-alone equity.  Citi initiated coverage of Delek US (DK) with a Neutral rating and $26 price target as the firm initiated coverage of refiners, saying the stock is its least preferred name in the group.  Citi analyst Vikram Bagri initiated coverage of Valero (VLO) with a Buy rating and $160 price target.

Concerns about fading demand for electric vehicles have sent its shares down 16% this month through Tuesday\u2019s close. That paints a troubling picture of market sentiment, with Tesla tumbling while other tech counterparts soar to record highs. Price cuts and rising costs have added to the gloom.\n\n\u201cTesla investors are looking for a bullish catalyst, but there isn\u2019t one in sight,\u201d Adam Sarhan, founder and CEO of 50 Park Investments, said in an interview. \u201cInvestors are going to pay these multiples for earnings for only so long, and if the fundamental story changes and earnings get compressed, then valuation gets compressed.\u201d\n\nThe big question is how many cars Tesla can deliver in 2024, and whether the company offers more information on plans for its lower-cost model, which it expects to make in Texas and a forthcoming plant in Mexico.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d expect guidance of 2 million cars a year at the low end,\u201d Seth Goldstein, an analyst at Morningstar Research, said in a phone interview. \u201cIt would be great if management would give us a timeline on the Model 2 vehicle and platform, because that will be the next major driver of deliveries.\u201d\n\nAnalysts expect the company to sell about 2.2 million vehicles this year, which would represent about 22% growth from the 1.8 million delivered in 2023, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Tesla shares rose as much as 1.7% at 9:42 a.m. in New York on Wednesday, ahead of the post-market results.\n\nStory continues\n\nChallenges are mounting with automakers, suppliers and even car-rental firms warning that interest in EVs is waning. General Motors Co. and Ford Motor Co. are scaling back their EV expansion plans, while Hertz Global Holdings Inc. is selling off a chunk of its electric fleet and reinvesting in gas cars. While Tesla has responded by lowering prices further, that has eroded its once-hefty profit margin.\n\n\u201cNegative developments in the global EV market very much matter to Tesla and should reasonably have a negative near-term impact on the price of the stock,\u201d Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas wrote in a note on Monday, while pointing out that Tesla is both an auto stock, as well as an energy, AI and robotics company. Jonas expects the company to provide a \u201cclearly cautious outlook\u201d for 2024.\n\nTesla\u2019s stock trades at 54 times forward earnings, nearly double the Bloomberg Magnificent 7 Price Return Index average of 28 times. That\u2019s after the stock ended 2023 up more than 100%, rebounding from the year before. Tesla\u2019s association with the other tech megacaps also helped the shares amid an investor frenzy for AI plays.\n\nLast year\u2019s rally coincided with a steep drop in Wall Street estimates for Tesla\u2019s 2023 earnings. Analysts currently expect it to report a profit of $3.09 a share for the year \u2014 42% lower than expectations at the end of 2022.\n\n\u201cIts valuation appears indifferent to margin pressure from pricing and rising capital needs,\u201d Redburn Atlantic\u2019s Adrian Yanoshik wrote in a note Wednesday, rating Tesla as a sell.\n\nClose attention also will be paid to any update on Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk\u2019s recent comments suggesting he\u2019d prefer to build AI and robotics products elsewhere unless the Tesla board arranges another massive stock award for him.\n\n\u201cA lot of Tesla\u2019s valuation has been predicated on the fact that AI and self-driving are part of the company. But if Elon is going to take that away, then that changes the narrative,\u201d 50 Park\u2019s Sarhan said.\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nNetflix Inc. shares breached a level unseen since 2022 after the firm posted its best quarter of growth since viewers were stuck at home in the early days of the pandemic. The stock\u2019s rebound has been driven by a crackdown on password sharing, the introduction of a cheaper advertising-supported option and a strong content lineup \u2014 a performance that stands in contrast to many of its competitors.\n\nTop Tech News\n\nASML Holding NV orders more than tripled last quarter from the previous three months, in a sign that the semiconductor industry is resurgent. Apple Inc., reaching a make-or-break point in its decade-old effort to build a car, has pivoted to a less ambitious design with the intent of finally bringing an electric vehicle to market. SAP SE shares jumped the most in more than three years after the German software company said it\u2019s planning a restructuring that will affect about 8,000 jobs and increase its focus on artificial intelligence. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. gained its most in six months after billionaire co-founder Jack Ma bought stock, a much-needed boost for a company weathering internal turmoil and a stock market rout.

Headlines like\u00a0this one from\u00a0Bloomberg quickly indicate that the sector is in \u2018shambles.\u2019\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) \u2013 the market leader \u2013 has seen its share prices drop to levels that it hasn\u2019t tested for two months. It\u2019s been a particularly rough start to the year for Elon Musk\u2019s company, a barometer for the overall market.\n\nIt\u2019s unsurprising that the rest of the EV market is also suffering. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean 2024 will be disastrous for electric vehicles. However, it does create a reasonable point for investors to drop certain stocks from their respective portfolios.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nEV Market Outlook: Faraday Future (FFIE) Person holding cellphone with logo of electric vehicle company Faraday Future Inc. (FFIE) on screen in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nFaraday Future (NASDAQ:FFIE) Is very clearly amongst the worst EV stocks available to investors.\n\nThat truth is exemplified in many ways, but perhaps none is more obvious than that its shares are about to get kicked off the Nasdaq exchange. Its shares are currently worth 15 cents, which is highly concerning in and of itself. It\u2019s so low that it doesn\u2019t meet NASDAQ compliance standards, which state that shares must trade for a dollar or more.\n\nHowever, Faraday Future\u2019s shares are nowhere near meeting that standard, which is why the company\u00a0received notice on Dec. 28 that it did not comply with the rule. The company now has until Jun. 25 to maintain a price level of a dollar for 10 consecutive days or risk delisting.\n\nIts flagship vehicle comes with a\u00a0launch lease price of $4,990 per month and a $15,000 down payment. Something tells me the company\u2019s troubles are only going to compound moving forward.\n\nChargePoint (CHPT) EV stocks: A close-up shot of a ChargePoint charging station.\n\nSource: YuniqueB / Shutterstock.com\n\nRewind a few years, and the outlook for\u00a0ChargePoint (NYSE:CHPT) stock was infinitely brighter than it is now.\n\nStory continues\n\nThen, the company had a vast lead in the EV infrastructure sector. This\u00a0chart perfectly exemplifies that notion. The company then had more than three times as many level two charging ports as its nearest competitor, Tesla.\n\nThe assumption was that ChargePoint would be able to capitalize on its strong early lead and subsequently grow even stronger. That has not been the case.\n\nFast forward to early 2024, and it\u2019s easy to argue that other EV infrastructure stocks, including\u00a0EVgo (NASDAQ:EVGO), are simply better.\n\nWhile EVgo\u2019s revenues are surging, ChargePoint continues to endure a period of top-line contraction.\u00a0Sales declined by 12% in the third quarter, which nearly doubled net losses that exceeded $158 million.\n\nFor investors seeking a strong electric vehicle investment on the infrastructure side, charge point is simply a poor choice currently.\n\nFord (F) Ford dealership sign against a blue sky.\n\nSource: D K Grove / Shutterstock.com\n\nFord (NYSE:F) and the other legacy vehicle manufacturers continue to miss the ball regarding EVs. As a result, their stocks are not worth buying.\n\nThe legacy vehicle manufacturers have impressive histories after developing internal combustion engines that continue to dominate vehicle sales. These firms are also struggling with electric vehicle adoption. Ford and the other legacy manufacturers were not early adopters of EV technology, which opened the door for Tesla and others. Tesla, of course, has grown into a massive challenger to the legacy vehicle makers.\n\nTesla\u2019s success in commercializing electric vehicles paved the way for Ford and others to expand into the sector. Tesla proved that there were vast fortunes to be made from electric vehicles. So, the legacy manufacturers jumped on board, but to date, it has not worked in their favor.\n\nFord recently Cut production of its F-150 Lightning Electric truck. That\u00a0will result in 1,400 job losses, yet another sign that the company simply doesn\u2019t have its finger on the pulse of the EV market.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

It even missed the company\u2019s revised minimum target of 60,000.\n\nStory continues\n\nBy comparison, Warren Buffett-backed BYD has gone on to eclipse Tesla asindustry leader thanks to its range of affordable Chinese-built mass-market EVs that can better compete with Elon Musk's rock-bottom prices.\n\nAnother SPAC listing that went on to flop\n\nTaking Polestar private would mark a full turn from the strategy Wall Street favored during the zero interest rate days when it urged legacy carmakers to spin off and float their loss-making EV brands like Polestar.\n\nThey argued listing these startups on the stock market could raise much-needed capital for the subsidiary while providing price transparency for investors in the parent.\n\nIf all went well, both would benefit as many analysts argued that wholly-owned EV brands were not treated fairly by the market, leaving their true value unlocked.\n\nPolestar complied, announcing in September 2021 plans to go public via a reverse merger with Gores Guggenheim, a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC).\n\nBack then interest rates were still at rock bottom, inflation was deemed transitory and the market rewarded growth above profits.\n\nPolestar offered the alluring chance to invest on the ground floor in a pure-play premium EV brand unencumbered by the baggage of stranded legacy assets like combustion engine car models.\n\nIngenlath even took a unique approach of licensing production of Polestar vehicles to third parties like Geely and now Renault, rather than weigh its balance sheet down with costly manufacturing plants.\n\nYet Polestar proved imminently unkind to investors with the stock marking its all-time high of around $13 a share on the first day trading in late June 2022.\n\nEver since it has been on a steady decline, losing 84% of its value to last change hands at $2.10 per share, giving it a market cap of just $4.4 billion.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-byd-cutthroat-ev-price-131835886.html", "symbols": ["0HTP.IL", "TL0.F", "TL0.XETRA", "TSLA.MX", "TSLA.US", "TSLA34.SA", "VLVLY.US", "VOL1.BE", "VOL1.DU", "VOL1.F", "VOL1.MU", "VOL1.STU", "VOL3.F", "VOL4.F", "VOLAF.US", "VOLV-A.ST", "VOLV-B.ST", "VOLVF.US"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.994, "neg": 0.064, "neu": 0.8, "pos": 0.136}}, {"date": "2024-01-24T13:00:57+00:00", "title": "How Analysts Think Tesla's Profit Sizes Up In The S&amp;P 500", "content": "Following a monster year for the S&P 500 in 2023, investors might expect some bonanza profit growth.

If you\u2019re bullish about air taxis, it\u2019s fine to own Joby Aviation (NYSE:JOBY) stock. However, there\u2019s another air-taxi stock you can buy instead of, or besides, shares of Joby Aviation.\n\nI\u2019ve recommended investing in Joby Aviation, and I\u2019ll stand by that recommendation today. However, in light of a big risk that Joby Aviation is taking, it\u2019s wise to diversify your stock holdings in the eVTOL industry. So, let\u2019s delve into the details and learn about the recent debate in the air-taxi market.\n\nJoby Aviation and a Rival Strike Similar Deals\n\nJoby Aviation has several value-added deals in place. For example, the company is partnering with Clay Lacy Aviation to install the first electric air-taxi charger in Southern California, at John Wayne Airport.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlso, Joby Aviation and its Japanese airline partner,\u00a0ANA Holdings (OTCMKTS:ALNPY), announced a deal with Nomura Real Estate Development to design and build eVTOL \u201cvertiports\u201d (which are like airports for air taxis) in Japan.\n\nJoby Aviation\u00a0is collaborating withAtlantic Aviation to build eVTOL infrastructure, presumably including charging infrastructure for air taxis. However, Joby Aviation\u2019s competitor, Archer Aviation (NYSE:ACHR), struck a very similar eVTOL infrastructure development deal with Atlantic Aviation.\n\nIf you want to see how similar the two deals with Atlantic Aviation are, check out William White\u2019s excellent article on this topic.\n\nThey\u2019re similar in some ways, but there\u2019s also a big difference between Joby Aviation\u00a0and Archer Aviation. They\u2019re advancing two different eVTOL charging systems, and this may be cause for concern among JOBY stock investors.\n\nWhy JOBY Stock Is Risky Now\n\nHere\u2019s the rundown. Archer Aviation is advancing the Combined Charging System. This charging standard was \u201crecently endorsed by the General Aviation Manufacturers Association\u201d Plus, it\u2019s already being used by \u201cseveral top original equipment manufacturers cross the industry.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nThat\u2019s an advantage for Archer Aviation. In contrast, Joby Aviation\u00a0is advancing its proprietary, \u201cJoby-developed\u201dGlobal Electric Aviation Charging System. Regarding this, Joby Aviation assured last year that it\u2019s \u201cworking with numerous electric aircraft developers to ensure interoperability.\u201d\n\nThis reminds me of what\u2019s happening in the electric vehicle EV industry. Sooner or later, rival EV manufacturers such as Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) will probably end up adoptingTesla\u2019s (NASDAQ:TSLA) EV charging standard, if they haven\u2019t done so already.\n\nYet, Joby Aviation\u00a0is evidently pushing its own, non-standard eVTOL charging system. Does Joby Aviation think it\u2019s the Tesla of air-taxi companies? The company is taking a big risk by spending time, money and effort on its \u201cJoby developed\u201d charging system. So, investors really need to think about whether this gambit will pay off in the long run.\n\nConsider ACHR Stock With, or Instead of, JOBY Stock\n\nJoby Aviation\u00a0is still an interesting and ambitious eVTOL industry player. However, the company is taking a major risk with GEACS. Therefore, you might want to invest in Archer Aviation instead of Joby Aviation.\n\nOn the other hand, Joby\u2019s GEACS may end up being a huge success. Consequently, you could diversify your holdings by owning both ACHR stock and\u00a0JOBY stock. Still, I would own more Archer shares than Joby shares, since the fate of GEACS remains uncertain.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The company posted revenue of $8.8bn for the fourth quarter.\n\nThe streaming giant said its operating income surged to $1.5bn in the quarter from $550m a year earlier, driven to higher revenue and \u201clower than planned\u201d spending.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cNetflix\u2019s latest numbers shake off any suggestion the company is struggling to find new ways to grow.

Those calls sounded familiar, because we\u2019ve been hearing them for at least the past year.\n\nBut the broadening hasn\u2019t really materialized. And now the major averages are hovering at record highs.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s time to put to bed the notion that the rally \u201cneeds\u201d to broaden to be sustained.\n\nInfo tech and communications services are the two best-performing groups thus far this year. Utilities and energy and consumer discretionary are in the red, among other sectors.\n\nThe Seven (or really, Magnificent Six, since Tesla has slumped) has powered forward. Nvidia is still the standout, with a 20% jump this year on top of its nearly 240% rally last year.\n\nThat means that once again \u2014 but even more so \u2014 big-cap tech is responsible for the push to new records. The Magnificent Six have accounted for a whopping 89% of the S&P 500\u2019s (^GSPC) year-to-date return through Monday\u2019s close, according to Yahoo Finance\u2019s Jared Blikre.\n\nBig Tech hasn\u2019t reported earnings yet, so the stocks could take a hit when their numbers and forecasts come out. Both info tech and communications services are predicted to report year-over-year growth in both earnings and revenue, according to FactSet. It\u2019s certainly possible that they won\u2019t be able to meet the lofty expectations implied by the stocks\u2019 run this year.\n\nBut that was frequently the narrative around tech earnings last year as well. As the refrain went, how could they possibly continue to gain, given what was being priced in?\n\nAnd then Meta leaped 194%. Tesla doubled. Amazon soared 80%. Microsoft rallied 57%. Alphabet rose 58%. Apple gained 48%. And Nvidia, as previously mentioned, more than tripled. For some investors, surprise at these numbers amounted to an utter failure of imagination.\n\nStory continues\n\nNone of this is to say the same thing will continue to happen. But it certainly makes one question the idea that it can\u2019t continue to happen. morning brief image\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nA previous version of this story was corrected to fix the number of contributors to the 89% return in the S&P 500 this year.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/a-sustained-rally-doesnt-have-to-mean-a-broad-one-morning-brief-110058553.html", "symbols": ["AAPL.MX", "AAPL.US", "AAPL34.SA", "APC.F", "APC.XETRA", "GSPC.INDX", "IXIC.INDX", "MSF.F", "MSF.XETRA", "MSFT.MX", "MSFT.US", "MSFT34.SA", "NVD.F", "NVD.XETRA", "NVDA.MX", "NVDA.US", "NVDC34.SA", "TL0.F", "TL0.XETRA", "TSLA.MX"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.988, "neg": 0.01, "neu": 0.896, "pos": 0.094}}, {"date": "2024-01-24T10:27:00+00:00", "title": "These Stocks Are Moving the Most Today: Netflix, Texas Instruments, SAP, Intuitive Surgical, eBay, ASML, Tesla, and More", "content": "Netflix adds a record 13 million subscribers in the fourth quarter, Texas Instruments issues a disappointing forecast, Germany\u2019s SAP plans to cut 8,000 jobs, and Tesla is scheduled to report earnings after the closing bell Wednesday.\n\nContinue reading", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/m/ad1acf2d-afa5-3d06-add2-2a55586dff58/these-stocks-are-moving-the.html", "symbols": ["ASME.F", "ASME.XETRA", "ASML.AS", "ASML.US", "ASMLF.US", "EBA.F", "EBA.XETRA", "EBAY.MX", "EBAY.US", "NFC.F", "NFC.XETRA", "NFLX.MX", "NFLX.US", "NFLX34.SA", "TEXA34.SA", "TII.F", "TL0.F", "TL0.XETRA", "TSLA.MX", "TSLA.US"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": -0.649, "neg": 0.135, "neu": 0.865, "pos": 0}}, {"date": "2024-01-24T10:03:00+00:00", "title": "Tesla to Launch New Mass-Market EV Next Year.

Elsewhere, Donald Trump notches a key win in the New Hampshire Republican primary, putting him well on the way to securing the GOP's nod for president.\n\n1. Futures inch higher\n\nU.S. stock futures ticked into the green on Wednesday after the benchmark S&P 500 closed at a record high for the third consecutive session.\n\nBy 05:00 ET (10:00 GMT), the S&P 500 futures contract had added 22 points or 0.4%, Nasdaq 100 futures had gained 130 points or 0.8%, and Dow futures rose by 59 points or 0.2%.\n\nDespite a 0.3% climb in the S&P 500 on Tuesday, the main averages were mixed. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite jumped by 0.4%, while the 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped by 0.3%.\n\nInvestors are keeping an eye on both an accelerating series of corporate earnings and a string of fresh U.S. economic data this week. Hopes remain that the world's largest economy is approaching a \"soft landing,\" a scenario in which elevated interest rates cools inflation without fueling a slump in broader growth.\n\nAlong with a bevy of company results (see below), traders will also get a chance to parse through S&P Global's U.S. composite purchasing managers' index for January, which aims to measure activity in the key manufacturing and services sectors.\n\n2. Tesla earnings ahead\n\nTesla is set to headline the list of big-name businesses unveiling their latest quarterly returns on Wednesday.\n\nElon Musk's electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer, which is due to release its fourth-quarter numbers after the close of trading, is expected to forecast a 21% jump in deliveries this year. The guidance would be well below the long-term annual target of 50% put forward by Musk around three years ago, underscoring the intensifying competition Tesla faces in the EV market.\n\nStory continues\n\nEarlier this year, Warren Buffett-backed Chinese firm BYD (SZ:002594) dethroned Tesla as the world's top-selling EV maker for the first time ever, as it harnessed demand for cheaper non-combustion cars. Analysts noted at the time that BYD's crowning came despite Tesla deeply slashing prices to entice cost-sensitive carbuyers, particularly in the all-important Chinese market.\n\nWith these pressures in focus, traders may want to hear more about Tesla's plans for its next-generation vehicles. According to Reuters, Tesla has already told suppliers that it is aiming to start mass production of a new mass market EV in mid-2025.\n\nElsewhere on the earnings calendar, telecoms group AT&T (NYSE:T) and medical device maker Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) are due to report before the bell, while tech company IBM (NYSE:IBM) will post results after U.S. markets close.\n\n3. Netflix subscriber sign-ups beat estimates\n\nNetflix shares surged in premarket U.S. trading on Wednesday after a slate of popular programming helped the streaming giant add far more paying subscribers in the fourth quarter than Wall Street had expected.\n\nThe company signed up a robust 13.12 million users during the three months ended on Dec. 31, a 71% surge compared to the year-ago period and markedly above analyst estimates of about 8.9 million, as viewers tuned in for the series finale of \"The Crown\" and \"Squid Game: The Challenge\", the reality TV spin-off of its record-breaking TV show.\n\nRevenue grew by around 12% year-on-year to $8.83 billion, also beating projections. In a letter to shareholders, Netflix backed the health of its business, forecasting \"healthy double-digit\" annual top-line growth.\n\nExecutives outlined plans to roll out more price increases this year and turn Netflix's nascent ads unit into a \"sustained, healthy\" revenue stream in \"2025 and beyond.\" In a call with analysts, Co-Chief Executive Gregory Peters said the firm anticipates ongoing benefits from a recent crackdown on password sharing as well.\n\n4. Trump emerges victorious in New Hampshire\n\nDonald Trump's campaign to secure the Republican presidential nomination received a massive boost on Tuesday, after he emerged victorious in a key primary vote in the state of New Hampshire.\n\nWith 91% of the votes tallied, Trump held a comfortable 54.6% over nearest challenger Nikki Haley's mark of 43.1%, according to the Associated Press. The AP has called the race for Trump.\n\nAlthough Haley vowed to press on with her bid for the GOP nod, Trump's win gives the former president an iron grip over the race. He previously netted a record-setting victory in Iowa earlier this month, making him the first Republican to sweep both of the first two major nominating contests since 1976.\n\nMeanwhile, President Joe Biden said that the result in New Hampshire all but guarantees a rematch with Trump, his rival in the 2020 presidential election. In a statement, Biden claimed that \"the stakes could not be higher.\"\n\n5. Crude steadies\n\nOil prices steadied Wednesday, as traders digested mixed signals on global supply and demand while escalating geopolitical tensions provided support.\n\nBy 05:00 ET, the U.S. crude futures traded 0.5% higher at $74.72 a barrel, while the Brent contract climbed 0.4% to $79.83 per barrel.\n\nData from the American Petroleum Institute, released late Tuesday, showed that U.S. crude inventories shrank by 6.7 million barrels in the week to Jan. 19, as severe cold weather across large parts of the country disrupted production.\n\nBut the API data also showed a sustained increase in gasoline inventories and a small draw in distillate stockpiles, indicating that demand in the world\u2019s largest fuel consumer remained weak as cold weather disrupted travel in the country.

Tesla's cheapest offering, the Model 3 sedan, currently has a starting price of $38,990 in the United States.\n\nMusk said last year he was concerned about the impact of high interest rates on consumer demand for big-ticket items like cars.\n\nTesla sent \"requests for quotes,\" or invitation for bids for the \"Redwood\" model, to suppliers last year, and forecast weekly production volume of 10,000 vehicles, two of the sources said.\n\nProduction would begin in June 2025, three of the sources said. All spoke on condition of anonymity because the matter is confidential.\n\nTesla did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nTiming of next-generation compact vehicles was one of the most voted questions by investors to Tesla ahead of its quarterly results report on Wednesday afternoon, where it is expected to forecast a 21% rise in 2024 deliveries, well below the long-term annual target of 50% that Musk set about three years ago.\n\nMusk said in May that Tesla was working on two new products, with the potential for combined sales of 5 million vehicles a year. \"Both the design of the products and manufacturing techniques are head and shoulders above anything else that is present in the industry,\" he said at Tesla's annual shareholder meeting.\n\nStory continues\n\nTesla plans to make an inexpensive robotaxi and an entry-level, $25,000 electric car based on the same vehicle architecture, according to Walter Isaacson's biography of Musk released in September, which includes interviews with the CEO and executives.\n\nMusk said in 2022 that Tesla would make a dedicated self-driving taxi with a futuristic look in 2024, after several misses at its goal of achieving full self-driving capability.\n\nHe and other Tesla executives laid out plans last March to halve the cost of its next-generation vehicles, but did not provide a timeframe for the launches.\n\nSTUDYING A HONDA CIVIC\n\nTesla has a track record of missing its targets for launches and pricing, and it would take time to build volume.\n\nCybertruck production, for instance, has been delayed and slow to accelerate and its $60,990 U.S. starting price is 50% higher than Musk touted in 2019.\n\n\"They have been overly optimistic on most of their new product launches. Volume output is more likely to begin in 2026,\" one of the sources said.\n\nMusk said last year the affordable model would initially be built at Tesla's factory in Texas.\n\nMaking a profit from the cheaper EVs will be challenging, given the costs of batteries as well as traditional difficulties producing quality inexpensive vehicles.\n\nTesla in recent years tore down a Honda Civic, whose price starts at $23,950 in the United States, to study how to make cheaper cars, two separate sources said.\n\nThe next-generation Tesla architecture, internally called \"NV9X,\" will include two or more models, said the two people and one of the initial sources.\n\nTesla also plans to build cheaper cars at its factory near Berlin, and is interested in building a factory in India to produce less expensive electric cars, sources said previously.\n\nThe EV maker also has factories in Shanghai and in Fremont, California.\n\n(Reporting by Hyunjoo Jin and Joe White; Editing by Peter Henderson and Jamie Freed)", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-tesla-plans-build-electric-050300997.html", "symbols": ["TL0.F", "TL0.XETRA", "TSLA.MX", "TSLA.US", "TSLA34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.959, "neg": 0.018, "neu": 0.927, "pos": 0.055}}, {"date": "2024-01-24T02:58:22+00:00", "title": "When Will Tesla Report Earnings Today", "content": "Tesla's earnings are hours away.

For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article 5 Most Buzzing Stocks To Buy Now.\n\nInvestors are still deeply divided over what the future might look like for the stock market in the weeks and months to come. While the bulls believe a soft landing is in sight, doubts remain over the Federal Reserve's possible plan of action regarding rate cuts as inflation remains sticky. A latest Wall Street Journal report cited CME FedWatch tool data which says there is now a 50% chance the central bank keeps interest rates unchanged during its March meeting. When 2024 was about to start this figure stood at just 3.85%. The optimism seen in the last quarter of 2023 was overwhelming and proved to be fickle. The WSJ report also said, citing swap contracts tied to the consumer-price index, that traders now see inflation at 2.4% over the next five years, the highest level since November. This shows we might be in for a long period of elevated inflation and high interest rates. In this environment, would mega-cap tech stocks like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) which posted euphoric gains in 2023 be able to keep going higher? Only time would tell. For now let's take a look at the stocks that are trending these days. Most Buzzing Stocks To Buy Now\n\nLuis Louro / shutterstock.com\n\nMethodology\n\nAmid earnings, the beginning of the election buzz and upcoming economic data, it's interesting to see which stocks are currently trending in terms of high volume. For this article we used Yahoo Finance' stock screener which looks for mid-, small- and large-cap stocks with high trading volume and movement. From these stock we selected stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors.\u00a0 Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That\u2019s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\nStory continues\n\n13. Marathon Digital Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:MARA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 13\n\nCrypto mining and digital assets company Marathon Digital Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:MARA)\u00a0has gained about 80% in value over the past one year amid a rebound in bitcoin.\n\nIn December, Marathon Digital Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:MARA)\u00a0achieved record bitcoin production as Marathon Digital Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:MARA)\u00a0produced 1,853 BTC in the month, which was up 56% from November 2023. It was also a 290% YoY increase.\n\nOut of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 13 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Marathon Digital Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:MARA).\n\n12. Lucid Group Inc (NASDAQ:LCID)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 18\n\nLucid Group Inc (NASDAQ:LCID)\u00a0is one of the most shorted stocks in the EV space amid fears regarding production and uncertainty in 2024 due to upcoming elections. Earlier this month, the stock fell to an all-time low after Lucid Group Inc (NASDAQ:LCID)\u00a0said it produced 2,391 vehicles during the last quarter of 2023 and delivered 1,734 vehicles, better than the analyst estimates for 1,696 vehicles delivered.\n\n11. Nio Inc - ADR (NYSE:NIO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 18\n\nAs US presidential elections 2024 inch closer, investors are starting to closely watch EV companies as a new government in the US could make or break EV stocks amid new policies. Analysts believe if Republicans come into power and make policies unfriendly to US EV companies, it would bode well for Chinese EV companies like Nio Inc - ADR (NYSE:NIO) which would also plan faster expansion in other markets.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 18 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Nio Inc - ADR (NYSE:NIO). The biggest hedge fund stakeholder of Nio Inc - ADR (NYSE:NIO)\u00a0during this period was Jos Shaver's Electron Capital Partners which owns a $38 million stake in Nio Inc - ADR (NYSE:NIO).\n\n10. Vale SA (NYSE:VALE)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 34\n\nBrazilian mining giant Vale SA (NYSE:VALE) ranks 10th in our list of the top buzzing stocks to buy now. The stock is moving after Bloomberg reported that Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva wants his former finance minister to be the next CEO of Vale SA (NYSE:VALE).\n\nIn December, Vale SA (NYSE:VALE)\u00a0disclosed that its iron ore production of 310M-320M metric tons in 2024 will be flat when compared to \u00a02023.\n\nA total of 34 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Vale SA (NYSE:VALE). The biggest stakeholder of Vale SA (NYSE:VALE)\u00a0during this period was Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management which owns a $243 million stake in Vale SA (NYSE:VALE).\n\nMiller Value Partners Income Strategy made the following comment about Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cVale S.A. (NYSE:VALE) fell during the quarter with iron ore prices. The company reported 1Q23 revenue of $8.44B, -22.7% Y/Y, below consensus of $8.79B, and Adjusted EBITDA of $3.69B, compared to 1Q22 EBITDA of $6.55B, below consensus of $4.49B. The Brazilian miner produced 66.8 million tons (Mt) of iron ore in 1Q23, +5.8% Y/Y, below consensus of 67.7 Mt, 67.0 thousand tons (kt) of copper, +18.4% Y/Y, and 41.0 kt of nickel, -10.5% Y/Y. Although management reaffirmed its FY23 production guidance, analysts seemed to be concerned by the negatively offsetting impacts of weaker iron ore prices as China, the world\u2019s largest iron ore buyer, has threatened to curb any \u201cunreasonable\u201d price gains for the metal in an effort to prevent this year\u2019s steel output from exceeding 2022 levels. Vale generated 1Q23 free cash flow (FCF) of $2.28B, bringing trailing-twelve month (TTM) FCF to $6.73B, or a FCF yield of 11.3%. The company repurchased $763MM worth of shares in the quarter and paid $1.80B in dividends, bringing total capital returned to shareholders in the quarter to $2.56B, or 4.3% of the company\u2019s market cap.\u201d\n\n9. Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 43\n\nFord Motor Co (NYSE:F) ranks ninth in our list of the most buzzing stocks to buy now. Earlier this month Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F) posted domestic Q4 sales volumes, with record electric vehicle (EV) numbers. Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F) sold 25,937 EVs in the period, a growth of 24% on a YoY basis.\n\n8. AT&T Inc (NYSE:T)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 52\n\nAT&T Inc (NYSE:T) is buzzing as investors get ready to see the company's fourth quarter earnings report. Earlier in the month Oppenheimer upgraded the stock to Outperform with a $21 price target.\n\nOppenheimer's analysts see several tailwinds for the stock, including AT&T Inc's\u00a0(NYSE:T)\u00a0120MHz C-Band portfolio which now covers over 200M point of presence, or POPs. Oppenheimer said that about 60% of AT&T Inc's\u00a0(NYSE:T)\u00a0subscribers are now fiber, which means healthier margins and pricing leverage.\n\nIn addition to AT&T, other stocks trending right now include Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). AT&T is one of the most buzzing stocks to buy right now popular among hedge funds.\n\nMiller Value Income Strategy made the following comment about AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cOur third-largest holding at quarter end was\u00a0AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T), a leading provider of communications and connectivity services in the US. At $15/share, the stock trades at the same price it did almost thirty years ago. The share price is much less interesting to us in relation to where it has traded in the past than in relation to how much cash the company generates and what management is doing with it. At just over 6x earnings, the stock trades near its lowest price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple ever, also representing close to its largest-ever P/E discount to the stock market. The business converts most of its earnings to free cash flow, implying a forward free cash flow yield north of 15%. Just under half of free cash flow is going toward the dividend (7.5% yield), while much of the balance is going to debt paydown. In other words, if the stock does not fall below its lowest-ever valuation, investors clip a rock-solid 7.5% in cash, while owning a growing portion of a very steady business as management reduces debt outstanding. A discounted cash flow model will suggest that intrinsic value for shares begins with a \u201c2,\u201d suggesting the stock is undervalued on an absolute basis. The lack of volatility in the underlying fundamentals also makes it unique when compared to many other things we own, which reduces the probability of permanent capital impairment and argues for a significant weight in the portfolio.\n\nAT&T looks particularly attractive when compared to some of the larger names dominating the S&P 500. Compare the stock to Apple, for instance, whose revenues and profits are likely to shrink this year, even as it trades at 29x this year\u2019s earnings estimate. The ongoing return to rationality and capital accountability, along with extreme valuations in the megacap tech stocks, have us more excited about our portfolio\u2019s prospects than we can remember for quite some time. As always, we remain the largest investors and welcome any questions or comments.\u201d\n\n7. Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 70\n\nIntel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC)\u00a0is creating a buzz as investors get ready to receive Intel Corp's\u00a0(NASDAQ:INTC)\u00a0earnings report slated to be released on January 25. Recently, a Gartner report said Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC)\u00a0ranked first in the list of top semiconductor companies in 2023, with a \u00a0total semiconductor revenue of $48.7 billion.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 70 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC). The most significant stake in Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) is owned by William B. Gray's Orbis Investment Management which owns a $468 million stake in Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC). Intel ranks fifth in our list of the most buzzing stocks to buy now.\n\nUpslope Capital Management stated the following regarding Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cIntel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) \u2013 New Long: This is not a traditional long for Upslope in any sense. Intel is outside of the box in terms of typical sector and market cap focus, and the position is really a portfolio hedge (and structured as such). The thesis is very simple: Intel is uniquely positioned to benefit in two important scenarios, both of which require \u201cprotection\u201d for Upslope\u2019s portfolio: a continued melt-up in technology stocks and/or rising tensions over Taiwan. Combined with expectations and sentiment around Intel that were incredibly low, this nudged me to add exposure via long-dated INTC call options. While still material in terms of delta-adjusted exposure, the position has been reduced repeatedly and is much more modest today.\u201d\n\n6. Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 81\n\nTesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares are creating a buzz on the Wall Street as investors await Tesla Inc's (NASDAQ:TSLA) earnings that are set to be announced on January 24. The stock also came in the limelight after Elon Musk expressed his desire to have about 25% voting control over Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) in order to make Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) a leader in AI and robotics. Tesla ranks sixth in our list of the most buzzing stocks to buy now. Like Tesla, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) are also trending.\n\nTesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares have gained about 47% over the past one year. Some analysts expect Tesla Inc's (NASDAQ:TSLA) earnings to come in weaker than expected amid pricing wars in the EV sector.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 81 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA).\n\nTsai Capital Corporation stated the following regarding Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cTesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) ($248.48 \u2013 up 101.7% for the year. Recent high $299.29): Tesla has significant and underappreciated competitive advantages across multiple verticals including electric vehicles, software and energy storage. Misunderstood by much of Wall Street \u2013 and consequently a favorite of short sellers \u2013 Tesla continues to grow rapidly and increase its lead over the competition while delighting consumers in the process. Despite his unconventional (and sometimes off-putting) personality, Elon Musk is a visionary who has created enormous shareholder value. Musk is also a long-term thinker who has embraced the scale-economies-shared business model favored by Henry Ford and Jeff Bezos, intentionally reducing prices, increasing the customer value proposition and expanding the total addressable market. Tesla\u2019s massive scale and cost advantages are now challenging the viability of legacy auto, which has hundreds of billions of dollars of outdated property, plant and equipment in a world that is rapidly transitioning to electric vehicles (EVs). While we expect competition for EVs to intensify and for Tesla to lose market share over time, we also believe the company will increase production and deliveries from approximately 1.8 million vehicles today to approximately 15 million vehicles in 2030 and further its lead in autonomous driving capability. In fact, we expect Tesla will eventually license its autonomous driving software, creating high-margin (70-80%), recurring licensing revenue. Tesla is also one of only two companies that dominate the energy storage market, which has the potential to grow to several hundred billion in revenue as power plants around the world increase their focus on renewable energy. Our investment in Tesla is aligned with our preference for companies that have strong balance sheets and the managerial skill to reinvest capital at high rates of return into large addressable markets.\u201d\n\nClick to continue reading and see\u00a05 Most Buzzing Stocks To Buy Now.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nAnalysts on Wall Street Lower Ratings for These 10 Stocks 17 High Growth Non-Tech Stocks That Are Profitable 11 Stocks Insiders and Billionaires Are Crazy About\n\nDisclosure: None.\u00a013 Most Buzzing Stocks To Buy Nowis originally published on Insider Monkey.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/13-most-buzzing-stocks-buy-220818778.html", "symbols": ["9866.HK", "AAPL.MX", "AAPL.US", "AAPL34.SA", "AMZN.US", "APC.F", "APC.XETRA", "CVLB.F", "CVLB.STU", "CVLC.F", "F.MX", "F.US", "FDMO34.SA", "FMC1.F", "FMC1.XETRA", "INL.F", "INL.XETRA", "INTC.MX"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.999, "neg": 0.024, "neu": 0.889, "pos": 0.087}}, {"date": "2024-01-23T22:00:00+00:00", "title": "Is Tesla a Buy Heading Into Earnings?", "content": "Earnings season is always an exciting time to be an investor, with companies finally pulling the curtain back and unveiling what\u2019s transpired behind closed doors.\n\nAs usual, the big banks opened the season, with things shifting into a much higher gear this week.\n\nWe\u2019ll hear from the highly-coveted Tesla TSLA on Wednesday after the market's close.

Riley Wealth. \"We've got a lot of things to contemplate over the course of this week and next that will likely will end up being a market positive.\"\n\nAccording to preliminary data, the S&P 500 gained 14.11 points, or 0.28%, to end at 4,864.07 points, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 64.31 points, or 0.43%, to 15,425.30.

While electric vehicles remain a prospective future, the sector faced setbacks due to challenging economic conditions. For Chinese EV producers such as Nio (NASDAQ:NIO), these headwinds have been exacerbated by geopolitical tensions and other China-related concerns as well. This will have important implications for NIO stock holders.\n\nThat said, this leading Chinese manufacturer is poised for growth. Often viewed as a Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) alternative in the Chinese market, the company\u2019s pure-play EVs stand out in terms of their styling and performance. Additionally, the company\u2019s introduction of its NT 2.0 platform with enhanced ADAS is worth watching. This platform should boost demand for Nio\u2019s SUVs, which already benefit from higher relative gross margins. Nio\u2019s strategic move to be among the first EV players to offer the Battery-as-a-Service (BaaS) business model (since August 2020) further ensures sustainable revenue and customer loyalty.\n\nThough Nio is a few years away from consistent profits, the company closed out September with $6.2 billion in cash and received a $2.2 billion equity investment from CYVN Investments in late 2023. This has provided ample resources for production expansion and ongoing innovation.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhat\u2019s in Store for NIO\n\nNio\u2019s ET9 luxury sedan will launch in the first quarter of 2025, priced at approximately $112,000. Despite starting with modest sales, the vehicle aims to strengthen Nio\u2019s brand globally, boost margins, and showcase its 5-nanometer autonomous driving chip for a competitive edge.\n\nAdvancements in Nio\u2019s autonomous driving tech could open doors to robotaxi and autonomous shipping markets. Despite a reported 10% workforce reduction plan in November (aimed at non-core business segments), this move could enhance profitability and boost the stock\u2019s recovery prospects.\n\nStory continues\n\nDeliveries Start in March 2024\n\nNio unveiled updates to its vehicle lineup on January 17. On the same day, Nio announced upgrades to its existing models, with deliveries starting in early March 2024. In 2023, Nio achieved over 160,000 unit deliveries across eight models, securing the top spot in the premium pure electric market segment priced above 300,000 yuan (41,800 USD).\n\nThe upcoming Nio Banyan system version, set for release later this month, will undergo more than 40 functional upgrades. Additionally, this 2024, Nio upgraded its vehicle hardware, delivering new models in March with short-term purchase benefits. Chairman Li Bin outlined priorities: investing in core technologies, improving sales and service, and launching new products under three brands, including an SUV and a small car in 2025.\n\nExcellent Revenue Growth\n\nIn Q3, Nio posted revenue of around $2.61 billion, marking a 46.6% year-over-year increase. Vehicle deliveries reached 55,432, up 75% year-over-year. Despite a net loss increase of approximately 11% year-over-year to $624.6 million, Nio sustained delivery growth into Q4.\n\nDecember saw 18,012 vehicle deliveries, a 13.9% year-over-year increase, totaling 50,045 for the quarter and 160,038 for the year, reflecting growth of 25% and 30.7%, respectively.\n\nIf You Love High-Risk Upside, NIO Stock Could Be An Intriguing Bet\n\nNio\u2019s stock price has been volatile, and investors have seen what this means on the way down. However, if we do see interest return to Chinese stocks, and Chinese EV makers in particular, NIO stock should get outsized interest as a way to play this space.\n\nI think the company\u2019s intriguing valuation, at only 1.31-times sales, makes this stock one to consider owning on a fundamentals basis alone. But for those thinking long-term (say, five or 10 years down the road), I do think this stock\u2019s risk/reward profile is tilted to the upside. The only thing that\u2019s required to hold this stock is a stomach for volatility.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nChris MacDonald\u2019s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

However, the recovery has been slower than anticipated and has adversely impacted investor sentiment on Chinese stocks. After a dismal 2023, Chinese stocks remain under pressure and started the year on a rough note, as companies continue to await robust stimulus measures by the government to spur domestic demand.\n\nChina\u2019s property market crisis, growing deflationary risks, subdued demand, and rising trade tensions between the U.S. and China are expected to continue to weigh on the stocks of the world\u2019s second-largest economy over the near term. Nonetheless, Wall Street is upbeat about several Chinese stocks that are listed in the U.S., given their long-term growth potential.\n\nBearing this backdrop in mind, I used TipRanks\u2019 Stock Comparison Tool to compare the following Chinese stocks and pick the most attractive one, as per Wall Street analysts.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlibaba (BABA) Alibaba (BABA) logo on the side of a glass-walled building.\n\nSource: testing / Shutterstock.com\n\nShares of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) continue to decline this year after ending 2023 in the red. Macroeconomic challenges in China, intense competition from rivals like PDD Holdings (NASDAQ:PDD) and JD.com (NASDAQ:JD), and uncertainty related to the company\u2019s reorganization plans have dragged down the tech giant\u2019s stock.\n\nEarlier this month, Bank of America analyst Joyce Ju lowered the price target for Alibaba stock to $106 from $113. However, she maintained a \u201cbuy\u201d rating. The analyst expects the company\u2019s fiscal Q3 revenue growth to slow down to 5% compared to 9% in the previous quarter due to near-term \u201cturbulence\u201d in the Taobao and Tmall Group\u2019s revenue amid its strategic transition.\n\nDespite near-term headwinds, most analysts remain bullish on Alibaba. This is due to its dominance in the Chinese e-commerce space, solid fundamentals, and prospects in cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI). The company ended the fiscal second quarter with free cash flow of RMB 45.2 billion, a year-over-year increase of 27%.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith a solid cash position, Alibaba is well-equipped to pursue growth opportunities in lucrative areas like generative AI. It is worth noting that the company recently initiated dividends to boost shareholder returns.\n\nOverall, Alibaba scores Wall Street\u2019s \u201cstrong buy\u201d consensus rating based on 18 buys and two holds. The average price target of $118.60 for BABA stock implies nearly 73% upside potential.\n\nNio (NIO) Nio Chinese automobile manufacturer logo displayed on mobile phone\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nShares of Chinese electric vehicle (EV) maker Nio (NYSE:NIO) declined significantly in 2023 and continue to be under pressure this year. Investors remain concerned about the company\u2019s fluctuating performance, macro woes, and continued losses. Also, the price war triggered by Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has also hit Nio and other players.\n\nNonetheless, the company is taking initiatives to reduce costs and enhance efficiency to address concerns about its profitability. Meanwhile, on Jan. 1, Nio reported a nearly 31% rise in its deliveries in 2023 to 160,038 vehicles.\n\nLooking ahead, Nio is optimistic about its ET9 model, an executive sedan. Deliveries for the vehicle will likely commence in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nRecently, Bank of America analyst Ming-Hsun Lee downgraded Nio stock to \u201chold\u201d from \u201cbuy\u201d with a price target of $9, citing disappointing sales and valuation concerns. The analyst expects the company\u2019s sales to face hurdles in the first three quarters of this year due to the lack of new model launches and a potential slowdown in volume growth. The analyst also projects higher-than-anticipated operating expenses due to increased spending on marketing campaigns.\n\nWall Street has a \u201cmoderate buy\u201d consensus rating on Nio based on six buys and four holds. At $10.86, the average price target for Nio stock indicates about 82% upside potential.\n\nLi Auto (LI) Li Auto (Li Xiang) brand logo and electric car in store. A Chinese EV(electric vehicle) company\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nMacro worries and sluggish growth trends in China\u2019s EV market have impacted investor sentiment for Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI) stock so far in 2024, even though the company\u2019s performance has been impressive in recent quarters.\n\nEarlier this month, Li Auto reported 50,353 deliveries for December 2023, which marked a 137% year-over-year increase. With this, the company\u2019s 2023 deliveries increased 182% to 376,030 units. It is also worth noting that unlike several unprofitable EV makers, Li Auto delivered profits in each of the first three quarters of 2023.\n\nOverall, Li Auto seems well-positioned for continued growth. Its new EV models like MEGA, the recently announced partnership with chip giant Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), and operating efficiency and cost-management efforts are boosting its profitability.\n\nRecently, analysts at Bank of America called Li Auto one of their \u201cTop Picks\u201d for 2024. Additionally, they reiterated a \u201cbuy\u201d rating on the stock with a price target of $55. Analysts at the bank expect Li Auto to win incremental share in the Chinese EV market this year, driven by its expanding product offerings. The bullish stance is also backed by a rise in Li Auto\u2019s penetration in the luxury/premium EV segment and a solid pipeline of upcoming models.\n\nOverall, Li Auto scores a \u201cstrong buy\u201d consensus rating backed by six unanimous buys. The average price target of $53.58 for Li Auto stock implies over 95% upside from current levels.\n\nIn conclusion, Wall Street is highly bullish on Li Auto and Alibaba. It is cautiously optimistic about Nio due to profitability concerns. Currently, analysts see higher upside potential in Li Auto than in the other two Chinese stocks. Management\u2019s solid execution and continued demand for Li Auto\u2019s EVs should boost the company\u2019s revenue and profitability in the years ahead.\n\nOn the date of publication, Sirisha Bhogaraju\u00a0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nSirisha Bhogaraju has over 15 years of experience in financial research.

The stock doubled off the 2022 panic lows and has traded in a wide, volatile range since. Tesla, the leading EV maker, is expected to report fourth-quarter earnings after the close tomorrow, Wednesday, January 24th. Below are the essential items investors should know and look out for heading into earnings:\n\nPotential Magnitude of Move\n\nThe options implied move for an earnings report represents the market\u2019s expectation of the potential percentage price change in a stock following the earnings release. It is derived from the pricing of options contracts and reflects investor anticipation of volatility. Tesla Implied Move: \u00a0+/- 6.8%\n\nWall Street Expectations\n\nRegarding earnings reports, no metric is more important than a company\u2019s performance versus Wall Street\u2019s expectations. The Zacks Consensus Estimates takes the sum of several analysts on Wall Street to come up with a consensus number that analysts expect. For the current quarter, Zacks Consensus Estimates expect EPS of $0.74 (-37.82%) versus the prior year. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWill Oversold Levels Prove to Be a Prudent Buy Area Again?\n\nThe % Williams R indicator is a momentum oscillator used in technical analysis to assess whether a stock is overbought or oversold. It measures the relative position of the current closing price in relation to the high and low prices over 14 days. The indicator is expressed as a percentage and ranges from 0 to -100. Readings near -100 represent heavily oversold zones and have coincided with significant lows in Tesla in recent years. Will the oversold reading prove to be yet another buy-the-dip opportunity? Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nWhat Does Management Have to Say About Pricing Cuts?\n\nPricing cuts have put pressure on TSLA over the past few months. Charlie Bilello points out, \u201cThe average price of a used Tesla has declined 18 months in a row, moving from a record high of $67,900 in July 2022 to a record low of $35,844 today.\u201d\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nCybertruck Update\n\nTesla began deliveries of the highly anticipated (and delayed) Cybertruck. Wall Street will be anxious to see how the deliveries are progressing.\n\nHow is China\u2019s Economy Impacting the Company?\n\nChina is going through one of its worst bear markets and economies ever. Nevertheless, Tesla has largely weathered the storm. Yesterday, reports surfaced that China will stimulate its stock market. Because China is a vast EV market, investors will be listening to see what management has to say on the state of the Chinese market.\n\nWill there be an Update on Musk Voting Share?\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk has long voiced his fears about the progression of AI. In a recent tweet, Musk warned that he would not move forward with Tesla\u2019s AI ambitions unless he had a 25% voting share in the company (he currently has ~12.5%)\n\nSolar Update\n\nInvestors often forget that Tesla acquired SolarCity years ago. With interest rates rising, solar stocks have been in the gutter. Does Musk see the solar business nearing a trough?\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It has a leading position in the Chinese beer market, operating 57 domestic breweries and two associated and joint-investment breweries in 20 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions in China.\n\nTsingtao is its best-known international beer, served in more than 100 countries worldwide. Its revenue in 2022 was 32.2 billion Chinese yuan ($4.48 billion), up 21% from 2018. Its net profit in 2022 was 3.71 billion ($520 million), up 161% from 2018.\n\nDespite its revenue and income growth over the past five years, its shares have gained just 29%, considerably less than the 82% return for the S&P 500. In the past year,\u00a0its stock dropped 45%, partly due to a scandalous video that got out last October that showed a man peeing into a beer tank at one of its Chinese breweries.\n\nIts stock is oversold.\n\nBYD (BYDDY) Close-up of BYD (BYDDY) logo on red car, symbolizing BYDDY stock\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Trygve Finkelsen\n\nBYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDY) is the fourth-largest holding in the Global X MSCI China Consumer Discretionary ETF (NYSEARCA:CHIC).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company had a breakout year in 2023, although you wouldn\u2019t know it from its share price, down 16% over the past year. In Q4 2023, BYD\u2019s battery-electric vehicle (BEV) sales were 526,409, exceeding Tesla\u2019s (NASDAQ:TSLA) and growing its own 22% from the third quarter.\n\nNot only is BYD China\u2019s largest automaker, it\u2019s also the world\u2019s 10th largest by volume. It is currently building a new EV plant in Thailand that will open in the summer, with three others in Brazil, Hungary and Indonesia.\n\nDespite selling significant BYD stock in 2023, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B) still owns $2.18 billion of its shares, representing an 8.0% interest.\n\nThe company entered 2024 with shares short, accounting for 5.5% of its free float on the Hong Kong stock exchange. Detractors feel China\u2019s weak economy and increasing EV domestic competition could continue pushing its share price lower.\n\nYear-to-date, BYDDY is down nearly 8%. Expect a rebound in 2024.\n\nYum China Holdings (YUMC) A banner for Yum China (YUMC) decorates the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nSource: rblfmr / Shutterstock.com\n\nYum China Holdings (NYSE:YUMC) is the eighth-largest holding of CHIC.\n\nI\u2019ve written about the restaurant operator several times in recent months. CEO Joey Wat held valuable leadership skills that would help the owner of more than 12,600 KFC and Pizza Hut restaurants in China\u2014the remaining 1,400 are franchised\u2014expand its restaurant footprint across the country, reaching 20,000 stores by 2026.\n\nAs I said in late December, analysts really like its stock, with 28 analysts out of 31 rating it Overweight or Buy, with a target price of $60.10. Down more than 18% so far in 2024, it\u2019s lost 43% over the past year.\n\nHow undervalued is it?\n\nIts trailing 12-month free cash flow of $750 million is 96% of its net income. I would like to see a cash conversion ratio (free cash flow divided by net income) of more than 100%. Close enough. I also want to see cash and marketable securities higher than total debt. As of Q3 2023, it had $3.13 billion in cash and marketable securities compared to $2.44 billion in total debt for a net cash position of $690 million.\n\nTrading at 1.4x sales, it\u2019s cheaper than it\u2019s been since spinning off from Yum Brands (NYSE:YUM) in November 2016.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

This means that models like Grok, a recently released LLM by X, can potentially be used as a starting point for finding high-return investments. This has led to the creation of this list of growth stock picks by Grok AI.\n\nGrok differs from models like ChatGPT and Claude as it has access to real-time data. Additionally, it has been trained on tens of billions of tweets. The advantage of using Grok over other models is that by the nature of its training data, it\u2019s potentially more responsive to changes in investor opinion and sentiment, allowing users to get a real-time feel of how the market feels about a company before opening a position.\n\nIn the context of growth stocks, which are more speculative by nature than more mature businesses, Grok can be an invaluable tool for honing in on the best investment ideas. So here are the best growth stock picks by Grok AI for investors to consider.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA stock) Motors store in Piazza Gae Aulenti square in Milan, Italy. TSLA stock\n\nSource: Zigres / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs Elon Musk owns a majority stake in X and was a key initiator of the Grok AI project, it may then not be so surprising to see Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) as one of those growth stock picks by Grok AI.\n\nStill, TSLA has reached a kind of cult status of its own, and Wall Street analysts collectively believe that its share price will increase by 7% over the next twelve months.\n\nHere\u2019s what Grok had to say about TSLA stock:\n\n\u201cAs the world continues to shift towards sustainable energy solutions, Tesla is well-positioned to be a leader in the electric vehicle market. With their innovative technology and growing global presence, Tesla\u2019s stock is poised for significant growth in the coming years.\u201d\n\nGrok\u2019s assessment seems to be supported by analyst estimates for TSLA\u2019s top and bottom lines. The company is expected to increase its EPS to $5.10 by 2025, along with strengthening its top-line revenue.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is another name that\u2019s reached a cult-like status amongst growth investors. The recovery of its stock price has many investors feeling that the best is yet to come, as its stock price has gained roughly 60% over the past year.\n\nGrok weighed in on AMZN stock, stating:\n\n\u201cAmazon has consistently shown strong growth over the years, and with the continued expansion of its e-commerce and cloud computing services, they are likely to continue this trend. Additionally, their recent investments in healthcare and grocery delivery services could provide new avenues for growth in the future.\u201c\n\nInvestors may also appreciate that Wall Street shares some of Grok\u2019s enthusiasm.

It also has a heavy presence in the crypto market, offering Bitcoin products and enabling Bitcoin-based commerce on its merchant platform.\n\nSince I\u2019m bullish on both fintech and Bitcoin (BTC-USD), I believe that SQ\u2019s continued integration of both will give it a key competitive advantage moving forward, especially as its peers are focused on traditional fiat transfers.\n\nBut here\u2019s what Grok had to say about SQ stock:\n\n\u201cSquare\u2019s innovative approach to financial services and payment processing has made them a popular choice among small businesses and consumers alike. With the increasing popularity of digital payments and the company\u2019s expansion into new markets, Square\u2019s stock is likely to see significant growth in the coming years.\u201c\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Brace yourself for an adventurous ride and invest in the top EV stocks to take home significant gains.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) on phone screen stock image.\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has repeatedly proved why it is one of the best EV makers in the industry today. The macroeconomic factors and high interest rates have hurt the automaker, but it is temporary. An improved economy will result in interest rate cuts and growing EV demand. Tesla has already established itself as an industry leader and is well ahead of the competition.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTesla resorted to many price cuts last year to boost the demand. This ensured steady deliveries, but profitability dropped as well as gross margin and operating margin. However, it is temporary. Looking at the bigger picture, Tesla is one of the best.\n\nThe company has already invested a considerable amount into the business, which gives it a cost advantage in terms of its manufacturing capabilities. Tesla has also opened its charging facilities for several other automakers in the industry, which will generate steady revenue in the coming years. It delivered a record 4,84,507 cars in the fourth quarter and also started delivering the Cybertruck.\n\nTesla is also investing in artificial intelligence (AI) and full self-driving capabilities. It has ambitious goals, which include launching a fleet of robotaxis. Trading at $208 today, TSLA stock is down 15% year to date, and this drop is a chance to buy the stock. It is trading much lower than the 52-week high of $299 and is one EV stock you wouldn\u2019t regret owning. The company is set to report earnings today, which might not be as impressive as expected. However, Tesla is a solid buy for the long term.\n\nStory continues\n\nLi Auto (LI) Li Auto electric car in store. Li Auto Also known as Li Xiang, is a Chinese electric vehicle (EV) company\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere are multiple reasons to bet on Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI). It\u2019s one EV maker that has not disappointed throughout 2023. Trading at $27 today, the stock was up 16% in the year but has lost most of its value since the beginning of January. It is down 20% year to date, but this drop is not due to any news or announcements related to the company. This is why I believe the drop is temporary.\n\nWhen it comes to the financials or the delivery numbers, Li Auto has impressed investors. In the fourth quarter, it delivered a record\u00a0131,805 cars, up 184% year over year, and its cumulative deliveries for the year reached 376,030, up 182% year over year.\n\nThe company will start deliveries of Li Mega in March, which could boost the stock. It is also breaking its records with monthly deliveries and has already hit the delivery projections for the fourth quarter. I am sure its quarterly results will be impressive. In the third quarter, it reported a revenue of $4.75 billion, up 271% year over year.\n\nWhile Li\u2019s delivery numbers prove that its cars are in high demand and meet the consumers\u2019 expectations, Li is now set to\u00a0launch the L6 in April. The company also aims to launch three pure-electric models in the year\u2019s second half.\n\nInvesting in the stock while it is trading at a discount could be smart, and LI stock could hit new highs this year. The company is firing on all cylinders, and it hasn\u2019t tested the other geographical locations yet, so there is ample scope for growth.\n\nBYD Company (BYDDF) A close-up view of the power supply plugged into a vehicle from BYD Company (BYDDY).\n\nSource: J. Lekavicius / Shutterstock.com\n\nBYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDF) has dethroned Tesla and is wearing its crown today. It has delivered more cars than Tesla and rapidly expanding in new markets. BYD Company could dominate globally with its wide range of cars and pricing advantage. BYDDF is one of the top EV stocks to own.\n\nThe stock is highly undervalued at $24 today and could soar higher throughout 2024. Despite reporting strong numbers, BYDDF stock has dropped 27% over the past six months. Once the EV industry improves, we could see the stock rally.\n\nRecently, the company unveiled its\u00a0AI-powered smart car system to help compete with rivals. It also plans to invest over $700 million in the world\u2019s first all-terrain professional test drive locations across China. The EV makers\u2019 profits soared over 100%, and they are giving stiff competition to other EV makers worldwide. It also enjoys a pricing advantage and sells its cars for as low as $11,000.\n\nBYD is also the second-largest battery maker in the world. It is expanding globally and has recently committed to building its\u00a0sixth factory in Indonesia for an investment of $1.3 billion. It aims to become the biggest EV brand in Indonesia, where the company has an advantage over Tesla.\n\nWhile Tesla is a top player in the U.S., BYD is leaving no stone unturned to achieve global domination. This site is set to be its sixth auto plant outside China, and its cars are exported to more than 50 countries.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Investors will be hoping the EV stalwart\u2019s fourth quarter earnings, due after the bell on Wednesday, could spell some relief.\n\nHeadlines like rental car firm Hertz shedding thousands of EVs, Tesla cutting prices in China, a two-week production halt in Berlin, and CEO Elon Musk\u2019s ill-timed demand for more stock have weighed on Tesla. Tesla shares are down over 15% since the start of year, with the S&P 500 up nearly 2%.\n\nLooking back on Q4, Tesla is expected to report top line revenue of $25.87 billion (per Bloomberg estimates), a 6.4% rise from a year ago. From a profitability standpoint, the street is expecting adjusted EPS of $0.73, translating to adjusted net income of $2.61 billion, which would be a 36.4% drop compared to a year ago.\n\nThe drop in profitability is due to downward pressure on margins since Tesla began its cost-cutting efforts late in 2022. Last quarter, Tesla reported gross margin of 17.9%, with operating margin dipping to 7.6%, both slipping sequentially and compared to a year ago. Investors will be looking for that long awaited margin \u201ctrough\u201d \u2014or bottom \u2014 in Q4, with an expectation that margins could slightly improve.\n\nEarlier this month Tesla reported 484,507 deliveries in Q4, beating Street estimates of 483,173 per Bloomberg. That figure represents an all-time record quarter for Tesla, nearly 20,000 units higher than its past record quarter of 466,000 units delivered in Q2 of last year.\n\nFor the year Tesla said vehicle deliveries grew 38% year over year to 1.81 million while production grew 35% YoY to 1.85 million. While its 38% delivery growth rate was below its 50% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) target, Tesla previously said it would not attain that goal due to factory shutdowns and improvements that occurred in Q3.\n\nOf major interest for shareholders will be Tesla\u2019s new 2024 vehicle delivery goal. A 50% jump in deliveries this year would equate to 2.715 million units, though the Street isn\u2019t expecting such a lofty goal. According to research firm Visible Alpha, analysts expect Tesla\u2019s new delivery target will be 2.19 million, up 21% from 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlso of note are Cybertruck deliveries. Tesla did not break this total out in its Q4 delivery update; analysts will likely inquire about delivery totals and production ramp up on the earnings call.\n\nAnalysts will be keen to see where Tesla intends to grow sales in an environment in which EV demand may be slowing globally, even in China. New price cuts in China, the addition of point-of-sale EV tax credits in the US, and an updated Model 3 now globally on sale may help boost Tesla sales.\n\nOn the flipside are a number of negatives like the use of margin-compressing price cuts, as well as a loss of EV tax credits for some Tesla vehicles in the US. FILE PHOTO: Tesla's new Cybertruck is shown on display at a Tesla store in San Diego, California, U.S., November 20, 2023. REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo (Reuters / Reuters)\n\n\u201cTesla has already announced price cuts in China and Europe that matched or exceeded our prior expectations of price reductions for the full year 2024,\u201d Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas wrote in a note on Monday. \u201cThe German Tesla price cuts came merely days after Tesla announced production cuts at Giga Berlin related to Red Sea shipping issues.\u201d\n\n\u201cFewer vehicles are eligible for IRA incentives given foreign content/local sourcing rules,\u201d Jonas noted, with Tesla\u2019s Model 3 sedan one of those vehicles. \u201cOur teams anticipate further weakening/dilution of consumer EV incentives globally as governments re-assess budgets.\u201d\n\nJonas also notes headwinds like excess capacity in China, fleet operators like Hertz cutting EVs, and falling residual values for EVs. Jonas cut his price target to $345 from $380, but maintained his Overweight rating.

(Photo by STR/NurPhoto via Getty Images) (NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nA big X-factor in the earnings call with CEO Elon Musk could be his recent comments on Tesla ownership. Musk warned last week that he will need to secure greater control of Tesla if the company's wide-reaching AI ambitions are going to be met.\n\n\"I am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI & robotics without having ~25% voting control. Enough to be influential, but not so much that I can\u2019t be overturned,\" Musk said from his X account last week. \"Unless that is the case, I would prefer to build products outside of Tesla.\" This would likely require a new stock-based compensation plan for Musk, who is already embroiled in a lawsuit over his prior pay package with Tesla investors.\n\nAnalysts will be seeking clarification on Musk's comments, given the long-term importance Tesla\u2019s AI initiatives, and the appearance that CEO Elon Musk doesn\u2019t have Tesla\u2019s best interests in mind.\n\n\"The Street views Tesla correctly (in our view) as a disruptive tech leader, and if Musk ultimately went down the path to create his own company (separate from Tesla) for his next generation AI projects this would clearly be a big negative for the Tesla story,\" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note to clients last week.\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

We have also discussed the growing economic importance of smaller cities. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 10 Cities With Highest Average Salary in the US.\n\nIn a shift away from traditional tech hubs, recent data from job and internship platform Handshake reveals an interesting trend among young workers seeking tech jobs in smaller US cities. Columbia, Maryland, leads the list with 190% year-over-year increase in job applications, followed closely by Boise, Idaho, at 116%. The appeal of these cities lies in factors such as lower living costs, diverse industry opportunities, and less stressful commutes.\n\nIt is worth highlighting that Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU)'s $15 billion manufacturing facility and acquisitions of local companies in Boise. Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU)\u2019s expansion is expected to create 17,000 jobs by 2030, contributing further to the appeal of Boise as a city.\n\nOn the other hand, a transformative $100 billion investment in Syracuse, New York is aimed at turning the city into a high-tech hub. The investment is part of the CHIPS and Science Act which is essentially a government initiative to boost semiconductor manufacturing in the United States. Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU) plans to build up to four semiconductor manufacturing facilities (fabs) over the next 20 years, creating 50,000 jobs in the region.\n\nThe top 10 cities attracting tech talent also include Fairfax, Virginia (103% increase), and Madison, Wisconsin (60% increase). These mid-sized cities are witnessing a huge increase in interest and hence, present a departure from the declining applications observed in major tech hubs like California, Washington, and New York.\n\nApart from the tech-oriented viewpoint, Glassdoor's recent research reveals the top 10 US cities where employees are most satisfied with their jobs. The rankings are based on over 20,000 employee reviews between January 2022 and April 2023 and considered factors like cost of living, weather, traffic patterns, and popular industries. Topping the list was Provo, Utah, with an average company rating of 3.94 and an annual salary of $61,973. Other cities in the top 10 include San Jose, California, with an average rating of 3.88 and an annual salary of $117,188, and Santa Barbara, California, with a rating of 3.87 and an annual salary of $72,240.\n\nStory continues\n\nSpeaking of company ratings, Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) continues to be one of the best companies to work for in the US. In the last 12 years, Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) has made a huge impact on the US economy, contributing over $880 billion to the national gross domestic product (GDP) since 2010.

The stock has declined 17.3% over the past four weeks. However, given the fact that it is now in oversold territory and Wall Street analysts are majorly in agreement about the company's ability to report better earnings than they predicted earlier, the stock could be due for a turnaround.\n\nHere is How to Spot Oversold Stocks\n\nWe use Relative Strength Index (RSI), one of the most commonly used technical indicators, for spotting whether a stock is oversold. This is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements.\n\nRSI oscillates between zero and 100. Usually, a stock is considered oversold when its RSI reading falls below 30.\n\nTechnically, every stock oscillates between being overbought and oversold irrespective of the quality of their fundamentals. And the beauty of RSI is that it helps you quickly and easily check if a stock's price is reaching a point of reversal.\n\nSo, by this measure, if a stock has gotten too far below its fair value just because of unwarranted selling pressure, investors may start looking for entry opportunities in the stock for benefitting from the inevitable rebound.\n\nHowever, like every investing tool, RSI has its limitations, and should not be used alone for making an investment decision.\n\nHere's Why TSLA Could Experience a Turnaround\n\nThe heavy selling of TSLA shares appears to be in the process of exhausting itself, as indicated by its RSI reading of 29.31. So, the trend for the stock could reverse soon for reaching the old equilibrium of supply and demand.\n\nThe RSI value is not the only factor that indicates a potential turnaround for the stock in the near term. On the fundamental side, there has been strong agreement among the sell-side analysts covering the stock in raising earnings estimates for the current year. Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for TSLA has increased 0.2%. And an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions usually translates into price appreciation in the near term.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, TSLA currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises. This is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential turnaround in the near term.

Since most of the recent market gains come from just a handful of leading stocks, hidden opportunities in growth stocks abound. Some are small-caps, of course, and those represent the best long-term growth stocks as they have more room to run. Others, though, are firmly within the mid or large-cap categories. Still, they remain beaten down by factors outside of their control that have limited bearing on their overall future.\n\nThe worst growth stocks, generally, have already been pushed out of the market as the Fed\u2019s interest rate hikes made unprofitable losers with limited prospects an endangered species. These stocks, therefore, have the short-term strength to stay afloat as we navigate whatever comes from today\u2019s questionable economy while offering multi-bagger opportunities.\n\nCrowdstrike Holdings (CRWD) CrowdStrike sign and logo at headquarters in Silicon Valley.

Businesses today face innumerable challenges, including geopolitical conflict, natural disasters, and supply chain shocks. Despite these risks, the vast majority of business owners (small and large) rank cyber threats as the most important global risk they face. Those concerned about cyber threats, data breaches, digital infrastructure destruction, and ransomware attempts rank among the top specific threats.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCrowdstrike, a top cybersecurity stock, is positioned to grow to meet that threat as technology innovation demands more comprehensive security applications. The company already provides its tech to various governments, corporate entities, small businesses, and even school administrators. Better yet, the company\u2019s revenue climbed substantially in each of the preceding five quarters while, critically, its past three quarters mark the first consecutive profitable periods. Though incremental, successive income boosts in an economy like today\u2019s bode well for Crowdstrike as it remains at the forefront of digital security and safety.\n\nStory continues\n\nGrowth Stocks to Buy and Hold: Palantir (PLTR) Palantir (PLTR) logo on data network background, imaginary location in the future. Must-Buy Stocks on Major Deals\n\nSource: Spyro the Dragon / Shutterstock.com\n\nSpeaking of AI-powered\u00a0tech stocks marking consecutive profitable periods, it\u2019s impossible to talk about growth stocks to buy and hold forever without mentioning Palantir (NYSE:PLTR). The much-maligned company seems to have finally found its footing after SPAC-mania sent shares surging well beyond reasonable expectations before the stock plummeted in a drastic overreaction to the reverse.\n\nBut today, the stock has marked four consecutive profitable periods as a glut of corporate and government contracts validates the company\u2019s position as a leader in data analytics, AI integration, and predictive forecasting. By marking its fourth profitable quarter, Palantir satisfies each of the requirements for S&P 500 inclusion. And, regarding market cap, Palantir is already\u00a0more valuable than almost 300 companies within the index. If Palantir\u2019s S&P dreams come true in 2024, expect significant momentum to carry the stock as more institutional investors wake up to its long-term potential.\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) CELH stock: A view of several cases of Celsius energy drinks, on display at a local big box grocery store.\n\nSource: The Image Party / Shutterstock\n\nIf you had to guess the best-performing stock of the past few decades, go with one of the many big-name tech firms or even a Magnificent Seven stock. You wouldn\u2019t pick a consumer-discretionary beverage brand, right? But\u00a0Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST) is the best-performing stock of the past 25 years, returning a 31% annualized gain since 1998. By comparison, second-place leader Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) returned \u201cjust\u201d 28% annually.\n\nWhile there\u2019s still some steam left in Monster stock, the \u201cnext big thing\u201d in beverage growth stocks is undoubtedly\u00a0Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH). Better yet, as you\u2019re reading this, a Bank of America downgrade sent pushed share prices down \u2013 representing an ideal entry point as the company consolidates and prepares for the next leg up. That leg up could come from Celsius\u2019 aggressive expansion plans, which include inroads into Canada, the UK, and Ireland. A core concern within the Bank of America report pointed to flatlining market share in the US as the flooded market saturated consumers. But, by opening new growth avenues, Celsius is set to renew its rapid growth trajectory.\n\nGrowth Stocks to Buy and Hold:\u00a0AST SpaceMobile (ASTS) Mobile global internet communications. World wide web on phone via wireless satellite network technology. Smartphone digital connection at clouds services of all earth. Holographic abstract interface. ASTS stock\n\nSource: Andrey Suslov / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for the high-risk/high-reward profile, pricing, and volatility that typifies many early-stage growth stocks,\u00a0AST SpaceMobile (NASDAQ:ASTS) gets top billing in today\u2019s market. The space stock trades within penny stock territory and sells an incredible story \u2013 satellite-enabled, 5G cell service globally without needing physical cell tower infrastructure. The company\u2019s concept proved viable last year after it completed the world\u2019s first low-earth satellite 5G cell phone call with standard cell phones. The successful test marked a major milestone and pivot towards productization as the company plans its first commercial roll-out later this year.\n\nBetter yet, the\u00a0company revealed major backers last week, including Google (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD), and AT&T (NYSE:T). The three companies, alongside other backers, are infusing AST SpaceMobile with much-needed cash to fuel its next steps toward marketization.\n\nOf course, early-stage growth stocks tend to dilute existing shareholders in the fight for profitability, and ASTS is no exception. Though the above strategic funding deal (totaling more than $205 million) won\u2019t dilute shareholders, a press release that came on the heels of the funding announcement revealed another $100 million in fundraising \u2013 from equity offering. The new equity offering dilutes existing shareholders by nearly 30%, and shares fell drastically on the news. The upside is that, operationally, ASTS\u2019 prospects haven\u2019t changed \u2013 they\u2019ve only gotten better. If you\u2019re in it for the long haul, a temporary share drop shouldn\u2019t scare you off. And if you\u2019re looking for growth stocks to buy and hold forever, today\u2019s per-share pricing is a perfect entry point.\n\nHims & Hers Health (HIMS) The logo for Hims & Hers (HIMS) displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Lori Butcher / Shutterstock.com\n\nTelehealth companies offering \u201cmale enhancement\u201d and hair loss solutions might not strike you as competitive for a running list of top growth stocks to buy and hold forever. But\u00a0Hims & Hers Health (NYSE:HIMS) is a clear exception as the small-cap healthcare stock expands its offerings to capture emerging weight loss trends. To secure a larger market share and keep customers (patients) moving within a single integrated ecosystem, HIMS recently announced a partnership with Hartford HealthCare in Connecticut. The move takes HIMS out of the digital-only landscape. It lets customers secure in-person referrals for treatment beyond at-home basics like weight loss, drug therapy, and cardiovascular health management.\n\nRight now, the connection only serves Connecticut-based patients and customers. But the\u00a0company claims to triage tens of thousands of patients daily and will now refer a handful of those eligible to its Hartford partner network. If the move proves sustainable and profitable, expect further expansion from this growth stock into the national sphere.\n\nGrowth Stocks to Buy and Hold: Unity Software (U) In this photo illustration the Unity Technologies (U) logo seen displayed on a smartphone\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nOf all the virtual reality and Web3 enthusiasm that came and (seemingly) went,\u00a0Unity Software (NYSE:U) stands as one of the few growth stocks in that specific sector with staying power, positioning itself to explode as the pendulum swings back towards VR and metaverse market interest. In the meantime, priced well below past highs, now is a great time to accumulate shares in this growth stock.\n\nUnfortunately, Unity is firmly in a \u201ctrim the fat\u201d phase, and its\u00a0recent workforce reduction points to some pain ahead as the company right-sizes itself to meet current market conditions and achieve operational efficiency. The move is just the latest in a multi-step series of \u201ccompany reset\u201d initiatives led by interim CEO Jim Whitehurst. Whitehurst is well known for turning Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) around in the early-2000s, and he\u2019s well on his way to performing the same feat for the stellar software stock \u2013 just be ready for further turbulence as he and the board realize their collective plan to reorient Unity\u2019s trajectory.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) supercharging station during the day.\n\nSource: Arina P Habich / Shutterstock.com\n\nGoing over growth stocks without mentioning\u00a0Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is nearly impossible. Despite the company\u2019s current troubles \u2013 including flagging EV sales and Elon Musk\u2019s personal power struggles \u2013 there\u2019s no doubt that the dominant EV manufacturer is set to keep expanding in the coming years.\n\nPerhaps most important to the company\u2019s core operations, Tesla is embarking on an aggressive path to create an integrated vertical supply chain that isn\u2019t dependent on outside forces. Those forces, including supply chain shocks and geopolitical maneuvering, are why the car market has seen so much volatility in recent years. To combat the trend, Tesla is creating an\u00a0in-house lithium refinery to reduce the Chinese dependency that many other EV manufacturers face. Likewise, Tesla is cutting out rare earth metals from its batteries, cutting down on logistics complexity while improving its overall environmental impact.\n\nWe\u2019ll likely see some further volatility for Tesla; practically speaking, this week\u2019s earnings report is likely to be tough on shareholders. But shorts consistently lost when going against Tesla, and this current downturn is no exception.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

Or if it does lose the beta label, it is only because the original goal of a fully autonomous robo-taxi worth five times the car\u2019s purchase price has quietly been buried.\n\n\u201cPlease slow down the FSDBeta v12 enthusiasm,\u201d cautioned Chuck Cook, a respected FSD driver in the Tesla community known for posting videos of\u00a0unprotected turns. \u201cDon\u2019t project autonomy on this build yet.\u201d\n\n'It's basically baby AGI'\n\nFSD was once the company\u2019s calling card, justifying Musk\u2019s back-of-the-envelope-math $1 trillion valuation.\n\nBut after revelations emerged that the 2016 video that launched Tesla\u2019s ambitions was dishonestly staged, customers have grown increasingly disillusioned that Musk will ever deliver on his promise.\n\nTellingly, he dropped his asking price by $3,000 after long predicting it would only ever rise.\n\nDuring the October Q3 investor call, Musk went so far as to play up the credentials of his creation by calling FSD nothing less than a rudimentary form of artificial general intelligence.\n\nPlease slow down the FSDBeta v12 enthusiasm. It will be great to see it come to fruition. But it will be an evolution from v11. I don't have it yet, but I can predict where it will be .... Better .. maybe smoother .. but don't project autonomy on this build yet.\n\n\u2014 Chuck Cook (@chazman) January 22, 2024\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s basically\u00a0baby AGI. It has to understand reality in order to drive\u2014baby AGI,\u201d he explained.\n\nNot even Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, has described ChatGPT in such a fashion. Yet Musk asserts that when it comes to functionality outside of predictive speech using large language models,\u00a0no one beats his company.\n\n\u201cTesla has the best real-world AI team on earth, period,\u201d he told investors in October. \u201cAnd it\u2019s getting better.\u201d\n\nBut the narrative has begun to tire for many now, and Tesla stock is down 16% since the year began.\n\nEven as many of its peers notch new all-time highs, Tesla has traded sideways on balance since December 2020.\n\nMore importantly, many investors\u00a0regret missing out on AI chipmaker Nvidia tripling in value, because their money was tied up in Tesla stock.\n\nAt this point, Musk will need to show his AI team really is as good as he claims by finally delivering on his ChatGPT moment. Otherwise, he risks more investors losing their faith.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/elon-musk-promised-tesla-very-131119992.html", "symbols": ["TL0.F", "TL0.XETRA", "TSLA.MX", "TSLA.US", "TSLA34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.996, "neg": 0.033, "neu": 0.86, "pos": 0.106}}, {"date": "2024-01-23T11:45:00+00:00", "title": "Missed the Boat on Tesla?

We are considering it, it's in the planning process,\" he added, without giving a time frame.\n\nProLogium has become the latest battery manufacturer to team up with Mercedes-Benz, as the German automaker works to make all of its vehicles all-electric by 2030 and catch up with EV leader Tesla Inc. Mercedes has invested in the battery maker, and they are jointly developing solid-state batteries.\n\nEurope has been courting Taiwan for investment, especially from the tech sector, despite Europe's lack of diplomatic ties with the island China that claims as its own.\n\nTSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker, announced plans last year for its first European factory, which will be in Germany.\n\nFranck Paris, the de facto French ambassador in Taiwan, said ProLogium had not chosen his country \"for romantic reasons\", and the investment showed France had created the right environment.\n\nFrance and Europe want to get more investment from Taiwanese companies, he added.\n\n($1 = 0.9178 euros) (Reporting by Ben Blanchard; editing by Miral Fahmy)", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/taiwan-ev-battery-maker-prologium-093544818.html", "symbols": ["TL0.F", "TL0.XETRA", "TSLA.MX", "TSLA.US", "TSLA34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.77, "neg": 0.004, "neu": 0.964, "pos": 0.032}}, {"date": "2024-01-23T02:47:08+00:00", "title": "Lithium Americas Stock (NYSE:LAC): Positioned to Profit from an EV Boom", "content": "As\u00a0global EV sales\u00a0continue their ascent, the American market has demonstrated some aversion to our electrified future. Still, stateside adoption is slowly but steadily growing, and Lithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) (TSE:LAC) finds itself in a unique position to profit from the expanding North American EV battery supply chain. Despite its one-year loss of 60%, I am bullish on the stock.\n\nIn 2022, the price of battery-grade lithium carbonate, which is measured in Chinese Yuan, reached its\u00a0all-time high at around \u00a5600,000\u00a0per metric ton, or $84,420. It has since come down to Earth and is currently\u00a0trading around its lowest levels since August 2021. However, demand is forecast to double by the end of the decade to over\u00a02 million tons per year by 2030\u00a0as EV adoption increases alongside the Biden administration\u2019s subsidies and tax incentives.\n\nLithium Americas is a pure-play lithium mining and production company. Founded in 2007, the Vancouver-based company has a market cap of around $743 million. Because of the company\u2019s premier project, it\u2019s poised to play a central role in addressing the looming supply gap based on elevated EV battery demand.\n\nGrowing Adoption and a Looming Supply Gap\n\nOne of the most well-documented reasons for slow EV adoption is vehicle range. To address this, battery makers are increasing the amount of lithium in EV batteries to improve range and vehicle power, with average battery pack sizes\u00a0growing from 50 kWh in 2018 to an expected 68 kWh by 2030.\u00a0This factors into a forecast increase in annual global EV sales from 14.5 million vehicles in 2023 to an estimated 45.3 million by 2030.\n\nAccording to Grand View Research, the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for the U.S. EV market is forecast to be 15.2% between 2023 and 2030. Globally, the EV market surpassed $452.4 billion in 2022, grew to $646.72 billion in 2023, and is expected to reach $1.669 trillion by 2030.\n\nAdoption in the U.S. will be a considerable driver of this growth and the subsequent lithium supply gap. The Biden administration and the private sector have\u00a0committed more than $25 billion\u00a0to expand public EV charging stations, with at least 40 U.S.-based EV charger factories being announced or opened in the U.S.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdditionally, Americans are eligible for up to $7,500 off the retail price of new EVs that qualify under the\u00a0Inflation Reduction Act\u2019s\u00a030D New Clean Vehicle Tax Credit and $4,000 off the price of used EVs eligible under the 25E Used Clean Vehicle Credit, which is expected to continue increasing EV adoption.\n\nAs legacy automakers like Ford Motor (NYSE:F) and General Motors (NYSE:GM) continue to refocus on EVs in an effort to steal market share from industry-dominator Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), ancillary companies like Lithium Americas are poised to continue supporting the transition to our electrified vehicle future.\n\nIn fact,\u00a0GM has an agreement\u00a0in place with Lithium Americas for 10 years of exclusive rights to all Phase 1 production, with an optional extension of five years, at its Thacker Pass project. The global lithium supply is expected to grow substantially by 2030; however, there will be an expected\u00a0shortfall of 2.3 million to 2.45 million tons per year\u00a0by 2030. For Lithium Americas, that gap couldn\u2019t be more welcome.\n\nThacker Pass, the Golden Ticket\n\nLocated in Humboldt County in Northern Nevada, Thacker Pass is an integral resource for the establishment of an EV battery supply chain in North America that\u2019s capable of meeting demand. In January 2021, the U.S. Department of the Interior\u2019s Bureau of Land Management granted a Record of Decision for Thacker Pass to Lithium Americas, which owns 100% of the project.\n\nConstruction of the mine began in early March 2023, and it\u2019s estimated that\u00a0Thacker Pass has a production capacity of 40,000 tons per annum (tpa) of battery-grade lithium carbonate for Phase 1 and 80,000 tpa for Phase 2, making it the largest known measured and indicated lithium resource in the U.S. The life expectancy for the mine is at least 40 years.\n\nThe project at Thacker Pass \u2014\u00a0the only fully-permitted lithium mining operation in the U.S.\u00a0\u2014 is being overseen by Lithium Nevada, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lithium Americas, whose\u00a0largest shareholder is General Motors. According to the company\u2019s website, Thacker Pass has an after-tax net present value of $5.7 billion.\n\nThe company has already established its mineral beneficiation infrastructure as well as its processing plant. Between the two, an 11-step process follows extraction and results in battery-grade lithium carbonate. The result of this is a\u00a0$6,743 operating cost for every ton of lithium carbonate produced at Thacker Pass. At the time of writing, the spot price of lithium carbonate is \u00a595,500 per ton, or $13,436.85, indicating a 50.18% margin for Lithium Americas.\n\nNot Profitable, Yet\n\nLithium Americas currently isn\u2019t generating revenue. However, that\u2019s largely attributable to the Thacker Pass project being in its infancy. Whereas behemoths Albemarle (NYSE:ALB) and Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile (NYSE:SQM) have been in the industry since 1994 and 1968, respectively, Lithium Americas has just 17 years in lithium operations and just received full approval for the Thacker Pass project last year.\n\nNonetheless, from Q4 2022 to Q3 2023, the company managed to increase its total assets from $27,838 to $363,491 while lowering its long-term liabilities by 39%.\n\nUnprofitable companies don\u2019t pay dividends, and LAC is trading well below its\u00a0200-day simple moving average of $10.27. However, the stock is well into oversold territory according to its Relative Strength Indicator RSI reading of ~25, which could indicate a near-term price reversal and a desirable entry point for buy-and-hold investors.\n\nIs LAC a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nLithium Americas doesn\u2019t announce Q4-2023 and full-year earnings until March 22, but analysts are bullish on the stock, giving it a Strong Buy consensus rating. The\u00a0average LAC stock price target is $11.50 based on eight Wall Street analysts, with a low-end price target of $6 and a high-end target of $19.\n\nCurrently trading at $4.61, even analysts\u2019 low-end price target represents 30% upside potential.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nThe outlook for the global EV market is robust and will contribute to a sizable lithium supply gap by 2030. Because of its Thacker Pass project and partnership with General Motors, Lithium Americas is uniquely positioned to address that shortage as part of the North American EV battery supply chain. The company currently isn\u2019t profitable but has been able to lower its total debt and total expenses while increasing its free cash flow. All of these are contributing factors to Wall Street\u2019s bullish price targets on the stock.\n\nDisclosure", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lithium-americas-stock-nyse-lac-024708992.html", "symbols": ["ALB.US", "F.US", "GM.US", "LAC.TO", "LAC.US", "SQM.US", "TSLA.US"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.998, "neg": 0.03, "neu": 0.857, "pos": 0.113}}, {"date": "2024-01-23T00:00:00+00:00", "title": "Magnificent 7 Stocks: 3 to Sell Before They Lose Their Luster", "content": "These three Magnificent 7 stocks will be faced with challenges in 2024, and are likely to underperform their peers.", "link": "https://investorplace.com/2024/01/magnificent-7-stocks-3-to-sell-before-they-lose-their-luster/", "symbols": ["AAPL.US", "MSFT.US", "TSLA.US"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.637, "neg": 0, "neu": 0.755, "pos": 0.245}}, {"date": "2024-01-23T00:00:00+00:00", "title": "3 Reasons Why Giving Elon Musk 25% of Tesla Would Be a Terrible Mistake", "content": "Elon Musk has $58 billion in unrealized gains from his 2018 CEO Performance Award.
