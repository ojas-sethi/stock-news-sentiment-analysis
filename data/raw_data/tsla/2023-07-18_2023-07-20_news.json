(NASDAQ:TSLA) hosted its first ever Autonomy Investor Day at its California headquarters. During the event, CEO Elon Musk promised the assembled analysts, journalists, investors and fans that Tesla is on the cusp of achieving full autonomy, known as Level 5 within the industry. He assured his audience that all Tesla vehicles equipped with full self-driving technology will be able to drive themselves without any human intervention whatsoever, allowing them to earn passive income for their owners as autonomous robotaxis.\n\nTSLA 15-Year Financial Data The intrinsic value of TSLA Peter Lynch Chart of TSLA\n\nInitially, markets reacted extremely to Musks prediction. Yet, as more time has passed, so too has skepticism of Teslas claims. Indeed, more than four years on from Autonomy Day, Tesla appears to have made precious little progress toward its goal.\n\nThe high cost of failure keeps getting higher\n\nFailure to achieve full autonomy would be a huge problem for Tesla. Indeed, it could prove fatal to the company. Musk admitted as much during an interview in June of last year.\n\nThe overwhelming focus is on solving full self-driving,\" he said. \"Thats essential. Its really the difference between Tesla being worth a lot of money or worth basically zero.\n\nThe core problem facing Tesla is that it has been selling full self-driving to customers since 2018. What that means is the company has been selling a product that is incomplete, on the promise that it will be complete imminently, for the better part of five years. As of March, Tesla had sold the technology to approximately 400,000 customers. Should the company ultimately fail to deliver full self-driving in its long promised final form to these customers, it could face significant civil liability. I discussed this very point in February, highlighting the efforts of analysts who have attempted to quantify the scope of Teslas potential liability. Bill Maurer, for example, estimated that Tesla could be on the hook for something on the order of $4 billion in FSD-related refunds alone. That could be the tip of the proverbial iceberg; should the company be ordered to refund the full value of the vehicles in addition to the FSD package, Maurer estimated that the bill could run to as much as $240 billion.\n\nClearly, Tesla faces a serious problem if it cannot deliver on its FSD promises. As the timeline is pushed out even further, the risk grows ever greater that Teslas potential liability will become a real liability.\n\nMusk sings the blues on latest earnings call\n\nTesla announced its financial results for the second quarter after the market closed on July 19. During the subsequent earnings call, Musk took some time to address the subject of full self-driving. Once again, he predicted that Tesla was mere months away from achieving full autonomy, though he acknowledged in the same breath that his similar past predictions proved erroneous:\n\nI know Im the Boy Who Cried FSD, but I think it will be better than a human by the end of this year, he said.\n\nMusk offered little in the way of tangible evidence to justify such confidence. The only real news he shared about its development was that Tesla will have to make major new investments in computing infrastructure in order to achieve full autonomy. That can hardly be called a resoundingly positive development, as the Wall Street Journals Stephen Wilmot observed on July 20:\n\nBehind the grandiose claims, the only measure of Teslas AI progress was the dubious one of higher spending: Musk said Project Dojo alone would cost more than $1 billion over the next 12 months.\n\nThis was actually quite a remarkable admission on Musk's part. After all, he had long insisted that Tesla already had more than enough hardware and computing power to crack full self-driving. Clearly, that was not the case. Of course, this was hardly the first time Musk has been forced to walk back his claims. For example, he spent years deriding other autonomous vehicle developers for their use of radar, describing it as a crutch at best, only for Tesla to adopt radar as part of its full self-driving technology late last year.\n\nMy take\n\nWhile the market continues to value Tesla at a hefty premium to its peers, cracks may be starting to show. The stock fell nearly 5% in after-hours trading following the earnings call, suggesting that investors were less than impressed with its latest update. As of the time of writing, Tesla was down another 10%.\n\nThe danger Tesla faces from potential full self-driving liability is difficult to overstate. The company has been selling a product for years that still does not exist, exposing itself to billions of dollars of refunds alone should it fail to deliver. It also threatens the massive pricing premium Tesla enjoys over other automakers, which is based in large part on its perceived leadership in autonomy. Should that perception waver, the company is liable to experience a painful downward revaluation, in my assessment.\n\nFor the time being, however, it remains to be seen whether Teslas post-earnings slump has truly snapped the rally that has carried the stock since the start of 2023.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-earnings-full-self-driving-212618026.html", "symbols": ["TL0.F", "TL0.XETRA", "TSLA.MX", "TSLA.US", "TSLA34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.96, "neg": 0.071, "neu": 0.838, "pos": 0.091}}, {"date": "2023-07-20T21:15:14+00:00", "title": "S&amp;P 500 Gains and Losses Today: Stocks Mixed After Latest Earnings Reports", "content": "The Dow rose, but the S&P 500 slipped 0.7% on Thursday, July 20, 2023, while the Nasdaq tumbled almost 2% after the latest round of corporate earnings reports.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/m/ed117c59-03fb-3b88-b154-2dd3842e8149/s%26p-500-gains-and-losses.html", "symbols": ["ABL.F", "ABL.XETRA", "ABT.MX", "ABT.US", "ABTT34.SA", "DC7.F", "DC7.XETRA", "DFS.US", "EFX.F", "EFX.US", "GSPC.INDX", "IBM.F", "IBM.LSE", "IBM.MX", "IBM.US", "IBM.XETRA", "JNJ.F", "JNJ.MX", "JNJ.US", "JNJ.XETRA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0, "neg": 0, "neu": 1, "pos": 0}}, {"date": "2023-07-20T21:11:24+00:00", "title": "Elon Musk not concerned about Cybertruck demand in Tesla earnings call", "content": "In Tesla's earnings calls where Elon Musk identified the state of the economy as \"turbulent times,\" the Tesla CEO is apparently not concerned about the demand of the long-awaited Cybertruck.

Yesterday, they had their earnings report out. News on the Cybertruck, Elon talked about how demand is very strong there.\n\nThey have an update on when they want to actually potentially see deliveries at the end of the year, potentially production. But back on demand, he was very bullish on it. Here's what he had to say.\n\nELON MUSK: The demand is so far off the hook. You can't even see the hook. So that's really not an issue. I do want to emphasize that the Cybertruck has a lot of new technology in it. Like a lot.\n\nIt doesn't look like it-- it doesn't look like any other vehicle, because it is not like any other vehicle. And the production ramp will move as fast as the slowest and least likely element of the entire supply chain and internal production.\n\nPRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Elon Musk said there's about 10,000 parts and systems on that car that need to be kind of like if any of them is a little bit slow or not lucky as he said, the production slows down. So that's sort of a big deal for them as they ramp up with a brand new product.\n\nAnd Adam Jones this morning talking about how he thinks that Musk has assuaged the investor concerns about the fact that he sort of allayed concerns that, hey, we're on track. It's going to be this year. Don't be upset.\n\nJOSH SCHAFER: I just can't get over-- we do a lot of the vibe checks on what the earnings calls are like. I mean, that sounds like your buddy calling you up and telling you about cars and, like, get excited.\n\nALEXANDRA CANAL: He talks--\n\nJOSH SCHAFER: It's of the--\n\nALEXANDRA CANAL: --a riddle.\n\nJOSH SCHAFER: Yeah, it was just like-- sometimes I feel like after these calls, his lack of specificness--\n\nALEXANDRA CANAL: That's very broad, yeah.\n\nJOSH SCHAFER: Like, that's what--\n\nALEXANDRA CANAL: It's of the hook\n\nJOSH SCHAFER: --hurts Tesla--\n\nALEXANDRA CANAL: --you can't even see the hook. It's a lot of technology, a lot. Like--\n\nJOSH SCHAFER: What--\n\nALEXANDRA CANAL: What does that mean?\n\nJOSH SCHAFER: What does it mean?\n\nALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah.\n\nJOSH SCHAFER: And what is the actual demand? And can you give me any sort of metric for an actual demand? At one point in that earnings call, he basically said that the analysts were trying to get too specific. And he said, let's just move on. I forget exactly what--\n\nPRAS SUBRAMANIAN: So talking about gross margins, we're getting too specific on it. We can't gauge that. There's rates. There's this. There's that. There's the world market, we can't give an actual forecast on gross margins based on the world being so unknown which obviously a lot of companies will give gross margin--\n\nJOSH SCHAFER: And what did people care about on the call? Gross margins.\n\nPRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah.\n\nJOSH SCHAFER: Right?\n\nPRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah.\n\nJOSH SCHAFER: But from, like, what the stock did today, the stock fell almost 10%\n\nPRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah.\n\nJOSH SCHAFER: Because when they wanted gross margin, guidance, he just didn't give it. I don't understand at some point why you don't just give a little bit more specific answers when people are looking--\n\nPRAS SUBRAMANIAN: I mean--\n\nJOSH SCHAFER: --for specific--\n\nPRAS SUBRAMANIAN: --you see the trend? It's trending lower. The question is, is this the bottom? And there was no answer to that. The stock was up a lot. I'm not surprised of the 10% drop here.\n\nJOSH SCHAFER: Yeah.\n\nALEXANDRA CANAL: No, no, it's true. And that, you know, even if demand is high, I know one thing you're concerned about is will the supply be enough to keep--\n\nPRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah.\n\nALEXANDRA CANAL: --up with the demand? Because that's something we've seen with Tesla. It's been an issue.\n\nPRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah, never been a demand problem.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/video/elon-musk-not-concerned-cybertruck-211124202.html", "symbols": ["TL0.F", "TL0.XETRA", "TSLA.MX", "TSLA.US", "TSLA34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.882, "neg": 0.068, "neu": 0.854, "pos": 0.079}}, {"date": "2023-07-20T21:05:00+00:00", "title": "Tesla Analyst Has Reason to Be Bullish on Stock Despite Falling Margins", "content": "Tesla shares retreated nearly 20% Thursday as investors digested earnings results that showed record revenue and strong profits, but also falling gross margins.

CEO Elon Musk appears to be involved in a secretive project constructing an all-glass home near the company's Austin-area Gigafactory, as reported by The Wall Street Journal. Dubbed Project 42 by Tesla employees, this initiative has been shrouded in mystery over the past year.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal sources claim that Tesla's board launched an investigation into concerns that Musk might be using company funds to build his glass house. The project is said to involve the purchase of millions of dollars worth of special glass, which raised eyebrows among employees. Limited liability firms associated with Musk and Tesla executives have also acquired substantial amounts of land in the vicinity.\n\nThough various design concepts are reportedly under consideration, the transparent structure will be situated just outside of Austin, Texas, with a view of Tesla's headquarters in the distance. One proposed plan envisions a hexagonal shape with waterfront views, while another resembles the boxy design of Apple's store on Fifth Avenue in New York.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nUntil 2016 it was illegal for retail investors to invest in high-growth startups.

As of now, the status and findings of the inquiry remain undisclosed.\n\nThe company had disbanded its public relations (PR) department, and Musk has refrained from commenting on the reports. The board's primary objective was to establish Musk's level of involvement in the project and ascertain whether company resources, including employee time, were being used for the construction of the glass house.\n\nStringent Board Requirements\n\nFor followers of the billionaire entrepreneur, news of the glass house might come as a surprise, given Musk's previous statements about not having a desire to own a home. High-profile tech executives occasionally receive perks, such as private jets, but Tesla's approach is notably stringent, requiring a board committee audit for expenses exceeding $120,000 involving people with material interests.\n\nTo stay updated with top startup news & investments, sign up for Benzinga's Startup Investing & Equity Crowdfunding Newsletter\n\nMusk's prominence as a major CEO adds significance to this case, especially considering his history of legal entanglements. He is still embroiled in a dispute with the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding his tweets about financial data and previously faced a defamation lawsuit from a British cave explorer.\n\nIn May 2020, Musk set the internet abuzz with one of his tweets. He declared his intention to sell nearly all physical possessions, asserting, \"Will own no house.\"\n\nDuring an interview with TED head Chris Anderson in 2022, Musk delved further into his unconventional living situation, shedding light on his perspective regarding the criticisms aimed at billionaires and their opulent lifestyles. When confronted with the notion that some critics find such extravagance offensive, Musk acknowledged the potential problem it could pose, saying, \"For sure, it would be very problematic if I was consuming billions of dollars a year in personal consumption.\"\n\nMusk\u2019s Circumstances\n\nHe was quick to clarify that his own circumstances were far from extravagant. He disclosed that he didn't own a home, opting to stay with friends instead. Musk's schedule often took him to the Bay Area, where much of Tesla's engineering was concentrated, and in such instances, he would rotate through the spare bedrooms of his friends' houses for lodging.\n\nMusk's frugality extended beyond housing. He shared that he did not indulge in luxuries such as yachts or extravagant vacations. But one notable exception to this minimalistic approach is his reliance on a private plane. He admitted that having access to a plane served a practical purpose, providing him with valuable hours for work, which aligned with his unrelenting commitment to his ventures.\n\nGiven the prominent entrepreneurs position as the CEO or Founder of companies like Tesla, SpaceX, The Boring Company, Neuralink and many others, this is justified as a necessity rather than a luxury. The growth of these startups is what skyrocketed his wealth status of \u2018world\u2019s richest man.\u2019 The lucrative nature of startups has even prompted a recent surge in startup investing among retail investors. Hundreds of millions are being invested a year in startups like Jurny, an AI-powered rental management platform that recently launched on popular startup investing site, Wefunder.\n\nAs Project 42 continues to pique public interest, these insights into Musk's way of life add yet another layer of intrigue to the enigmatic glass house being built exclusively for the visionary entrepreneur. It remains to be seen how this project fits into his overall philosophy and whether it will ultimately become the elusive home he once declared he would never own.\n\nSee more on startup investing from Benzinga:\n\nDon't just buy from your favorite brands, own them so you own the upside.

Now, some Wall Street analysts are making the case that it's just the beginning of a nightmare for Elon Musk and company.\n\nDavid Trainer, CEO of the investment research firm New Constructs, believes Tesla is worth just $26 per share after its latest earnings showed deteriorating margins and waning demand. That\u2019s roughly a tenth of the EV giant\u2019s Thursday closing price.\n\n\u201cTesla\u2019s (TSLA) second quarter earnings confirm our view that the stock is one of the most overvalued stocks in the market,\u201d the veteran analyst wrote in a Thursday note.\n\nAlthough Tesla managed to beat Wall Street\u2019s consensus estimates for the second quarter, reporting revenue of $24.9 billion compared to the forecasted $24.51 billion (and adjusted earnings-per-share of $0.91 against the estimated $0.81), margins came under pressure.\n\nTesla's gross profit margin fell from its fourth quarter 2022 peak of 24% to just 18.2% last quarter, slightly below Wall Street\u2019s consensus estimate for 18.8%. Musk also signaled that third quarter EV production will be down slightly, hinted that more price cuts could be on the way, and flagged an unpredictable economy in the company\u2019s earnings call.\n\nTesla has slashed prices on some of its most popular EV models over the past year in an attempt to fight off rising competition and economic headwinds, but the move has some analysts concerned about the firm\u2019s ability to maintain profitability.\n\nDespite the warnings from bears on Wall Street, Tesla stock has jumped more than 140% year-to-date, recovering from a brutal 2022 where tech and growth stocks were hammered by rising interest rates.\n\nAfter more than a year of recession predictions from economists have failed to materialize, many investors have been anticipating a soft landing for the U.S. economy and pricing in a new bull market for tech shares like Tesla, but David Trainer warned that could be a mistake.\n\n\u201cTesla\u2019s stock has been rising this year amid a sudden shift in overall market sentiment, with many investors now pricing in a soft landing scenario after a brutal past year of Federal Reserve rate hikes,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the shift in market sentiment doesn\u2019t change the fact that Tesla\u2019s stock fundamentals are completely disconnected from reality.\u201d\n\n5 reasons to be bearish\n\nTrainer, whose firm is known for its focus on analyzing corporate fundamentals such as cash flow and profit margins, laid out five main reasons why he\u2019s bearish on Tesla shares Thursday.\n\nFirst, he warned that demand for Tesla EVs has become an issue amid rising competition and consistent inflation. Tesla has now produced more vehicles than it sold for five consecutive quarters, and there are hundreds of up and coming EV models set to hit the market over the next few years.\n\nThe only solution to this demand problem is price cuts, Trainer argued, and that brings us to his second key concern\u2014margins. As previously mentioned, Tesla\u2019s gross margins have dropped significantly in the past few quarters due to consistent price cuts and rising costs. And \u201cshould demand for EVs slow, Tesla could find itself with higher than wanted inventory levels, which could lead to further price cuts and additional pressure on already falling margins,\u201d Trainer warned.\n\nThird, Trainer said Tesla is in the middle of a \u201cmassive cash burn,\u201d noting that the company has had negative free cash flow\u2014a measure of the amount of cash a company has left after paying its operating expenses and capital expenditures\u2014in all but one year of its existence as a public company (2019).\n\n\u201cDespite Tesla\u2019s top line growth, it continues to burn massive amounts of cash. Over the past five years, Tesla has burned a cumulative $4.2 billion in free cash flow (FCF), including $3.6 billion over the trailing-twelve months (TTM) alone,\u201d he wrote.\n\nFourth, Trainer argued that Tesla bulls rely on lofty estimates for the firm\u2019s full-self driving business and EV charging network in order to value the company, but these business segments \u201caren\u2019t material\u201d to the bottom line at the moment as some 86% of Tesla\u2019s revenues come from selling cars.\n\n\u201cBulls have long argued that Tesla isn\u2019t just an automaker, but rather a technology company with multiple verticals such as insurance, solar power, housing, and, yes, robots. We\u2019ve long refuted these bull dreams,\u201d he wrote. \u201cRegardless of the promises of developing multiple business lines, Tesla\u2019s business remains concentrated in its auto segment.\u201d\n\nFinally, Trainer believes that with price cuts weighing on margins, and competition from legacy automakers heating up, Tesla\u2019s current valuation just doesn\u2019t make sense. \u201cWhile Tesla is profitable, its profits are nowhere near the levels needed to justify its current valuation,\u201d he explained.\n\nTesla currently trades at roughly 80 times forward earnings compared to just over 25 times forward earnings for tech companies within the S&P 500.\n\nTo determine a more accurate valuation for Tesla, Trainer and his team used a reverse discounted cash flow (DCF) model\u2014a valuation method that estimates the level of future cash flows or profits that would be required to justify a company\u2019s current stock price.\n\nUsing this model they found that Tesla would need to achieve a nearly unprecedented 129% return on invested capital (ROIC) and become more than twice as profitable as Apple by 2032 in order to justify its current share price.\n\nFor reference, Tesla\u2019s trailing twelve month ROIC is just 24%, according to Morningstar data, and although the company earned a record profit of $12.6 billion last year, that was still dwarfed by Apple\u2019s $99.8 billion profit.\n\n\u201cWe aim to provide inarguably best-case scenarios for assessing the expectations for future market share and profits reflected in Tesla\u2019s stock market valuation,\u201d Trainer wrote. \u201cEven doing so, we find that Tesla is significantly overvalued.\u201d\n\nThe bull case\n\nOf course, for every bear, there\u2019s a bull\u2014and Tesla has its fair share of bulls. Take Wedbush\u2019s top tech analyst Dan Ives, for example. Ives saw Tesla\u2019s second quarter earnings in a very different light than Trainer and the bears.\n\nHe argued in a Thursday note that Tesla\u2019s gross margins, which Trainer fears will continue to fall, are in \"stabilization mode,\" Musk\u2019s price cuts have helped boost demand for Tesla\u2019s EVs, and the company\u2019s full self-driving (FSD) A.I. technology and EV charging network will help boost profits for years to come.\n\n\u201cThis is the \u2018golden vision\u2019 as Tesla is now monetizing its supercharger network with batteries and AI/FSD next adding to the sum-of-the-parts story for Tesla,\u201d he wrote in a Thursday note, reiterating his buy-equivalent \u201coutperform\u201d rating and raising his 12-month price target from $300 to $350.\n\nIves' comments echo those of Musk, who argued Thursday that recent price cuts are leading to \u201cminor\u201d and \u201cshort-term\u201d variances in gross margin, but ultimately FSD will be the real money maker. \u201cAutonomy will make all of these numbers look silly,\u201d the billionaire said.\n\nAnd while Trainer warned that Tesla would need to make nearly twice Apple\u2019s current profits in order to justify its current valuation by 2032, Ives doesn\u2019t see that as being so outlandish.\n\n\u201cIn a nutshell, we view Tesla where Apple was in the 2008/2009 period as Cupertino was just starting to monetize its services and golden ecosystem with the Street not seeing the broader golden vision at the time,\u201d he said. \u201cWe view this quarter as a major step in the right direction as Tesla is playing chess while others play checkers.\u201d\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nMore from Fortune: \r\n5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year\u2014all while working from home\r\nLooking to make extra cash?

That is in part due to Stellantis North America's focus on combustion pickup trucks and Jeep SUVs that command hefty profit margins.\n\nLooking forward, Detroit Three executives say new contracts with the UAW must allow them to be \"competitive\" as their U.S. operations shift to building EVs, which are money-losers for the legacy automakers now.\n\nStellantis CEO Carlos Tavares has warned a rapid shift to EVs forced by regulations is \"beyond the limits\" of what consumers can shoulder. Stellantis cited rising costs for moving to EVs when it announced plans to idle a Jeep factory in Belvidere, Illinois.\n\nThe Detroit manufacturers are expected to bring comparisons with Tesla to the bargaining table, people familiar with the process said.\n\n\"Tesla today plays the role of the Japanese and German automakers in the '80s,\" said Harley Shaiken, a labor professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who has followed the U.S. industry.\n\nUAW President Shawn Fain, in a statement on Wednesday, put his own interpretation on the term \"competitive.\"\n\n\"As we embark on this EV journey,\" he said, \"we are constantly presented with the same tired script from the companies; that we must remain 'competitive,' which is nothing more than a continued race to the bottom in a quest to follow the lowest bidder to pay poverty wages.\"\n\nTESLA'S COST ADVANTAGES\n\nTesla's U.S. factory workers are not unionized. Musk fought an effort by the UAW to organize Tesla's Fremont, California, factory. He posted a tweet in 2018 warning that workers could lose stock options if they joined the union, an action the National Labor Relations Board later ruled illegal.\n\nTesla workers earn about $45 an hour in wages and benefits, analysts said. That compares with about $64 to $67 an hour at UAW-represented Detroit Three operations.\n\nThe automakers do not detail the hours of labor that go in to building their vehicles - and those figures vary based on the different levels of vertical integration.\n\nBut using an estimate of about 30 hours of work to assemble a vehicle, Tesla would have a direct labor cost advantage of as much as $660 per vehicle over one of the Detroit Three.\n\nThat gap helps Tesla's ability to offer more features in its vehicles at a given price, or to cut prices without going into the red.\n\nHourly labor costs are just a slice of Tesla's overall superiority in EV profitability, an edge it is using to cut prices and gain share in the EV market.\n\nMusk's comment on Wednesday that he could have Tesla's humanoid robot, Optimus, doing useful work in factories next year is the least of Detroit's problems.\n\nFord CEO Jim Farley has said Tesla enjoys a $2,000 advantage in distribution costs because it does not have dealers with whom it shares profit.\n\nTesla also has pioneered use of large \"giga-castings\" to replace multiple parts with single, cast metal pieces that save on production equipment and assembly time. Tesla executives in March outlined plans to cut production costs by as much as half with what they call \"unboxed assembly,\" that could eliminate many of the steps on a traditional assembly line.\n\nDuring the second quarter, Tesla pulled in $150 million to $250 million in U.S. battery production subsidies, and enjoyed a similar amount in lower costs for lithium and battery materials, Chief Financial Officer Zach Kirkhorn said on Wednesday on a conference call.\n\nTaken together, Inflation Reduction Act production subsidies and battery material cost reductions boosted Tesla's second-quarter profit by $625 to $1,000 per vehicle, based on the company disclosures.\n\nTesla earned $5,000 in operating income per vehicle for the second quarter, according to company disclosures.\n\nOn a similar basis, Ford reported $3,220 per vehicle in the first quarter, while GM reported $4,400 per vehicle in overall pretax profit per vehicle for the first quarter.\n\nGM and Ford report second-quarter financial results next week.\n\n(Reporting by Joe White and Ben Klayman in Detroit; Editing by Matthew Lewis)", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysis-elon-musk-tesla-loom-205253101.html", "symbols": ["8TI.F", "STLA.US", "TL0.F", "TL0.XETRA", "TSLA.MX", "TSLA.US", "TSLA34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.989, "neg": 0.042, "neu": 0.867, "pos": 0.091}}, {"date": "2023-07-20T20:49:00+00:00", "title": "Tesla Stock Falls 9.7% Again After Second-Quarter Earnings Beat Estimates.

While strong growth is important, it is usually not as important as holding defensive stocks that can hold up when a broad-based market downturn happens, such as the one we saw in 2022.\n\nDefensive stocks can help to lessen gyrations in a portfolio during times of volatility, which is what we continue to experience now. Holding stocks that tend to skyrocket is no good if those same stocks plummets back to earth just as quickly. For long-term investors, stocks that can insulate a portfolio and provide low-risk growth is the way to go.\n\nFor buy-and-hold investors, slow and steady really does win the race. Knowing which stocks can both protect and grow a portfolio over time is important, though it\u2019s not always easy to identify these names.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWith that said, here are seven stocks picks for defensive, low-risk growth.\n\nBank of America (BAC) bank of america stock\n\nSource: PL Gould / Shutterstock.com\n\nFor a sturdy investment that can anchor a portfolio, look to Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). The second largest U.S. lender just reported earnings for this year\u2019s second quarter and they were impressive, as usual.\n\nFor the April through June period, Bank of America announced earnings per share of 88 cents versus 84 cents that was expected by analysts who cover the company, according to Refinitiv data. Revenue for the quarter ended June 30 came in at $25.33 billion compared to $25.05 billion that had been forecast on Wall Street.\n\nBank of America attributed the strong Q2 print to higher interest rate income. Earlier in July, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau fined Bank of America for past customer abuses that included fake accounts and unnecessary fees. While the fine was unfortunate, it ended a contentious issue and removed a cloud of uncertainty that had been hanging over the lender.\n\nBank of America\u2019s stock has declined 5% over the past 12 months due largely to the collapse of several regional lenders this past spring. Long-term, BAC stock is a winner.\n\nUnited Airlines (UAL) The side of a United Airlines (UAL) plane with \"united\" written above passenger windows. Represents airline stocks.\n\nSource: travelview / Shutterstock.com\n\nShares of United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) are winging higher on news that the Chicago-based carrier has achieved labor peace with its pilots. A new collective agreement provides United Airlines\u2019 pilots with a hefty 40% pay increase over four years. While no doubt expensive, the deal ends months of tense negotiations between the two sides and avoids what would have been a costly strike at United. The agreement with the pilots also comes as United experiences a post-pandemic travel boom, lifting its share price in the process.\n\nYear to date, UAL stock has gained 45% as investors once again warm to airline stocks. However, despite this year\u2019s gains, United\u2019s stock remains 33% lower than where it was trading five years ago, before the Covid-19 pandemic left its aircraft sitting idle on tarmacs around the world. This means that there is still time for investors to take a position in this reliable, blue-chip stock that can protect a portfolio over the long-term and provide steady, low-risk growth.\n\nFord (F) Ford logo badge on grill of car\n\nSource: JuliusKielaitis / Shutterstock.com\n\nShares of Ford (NYSE:F) took a hit on recent news that the Detroit automaker plans to cut the price of its fully electric F-150 Lightning pick-up truck by as much as $10,000. Specifically, Ford said that the price of its least expensive version of the Lighting truck will be cut by $10,000, while prices for all versions will decline by at least $6,000.\n\nUnsurprisingly, F stock fell 5% on the company\u2019s announcement. However, despite the short-term pullback, Ford remains a long-term winner and a great defensive stock to both protect and grow a portfolio.\n\nWhile many investors saw the price cut as likely to impact future profits at Ford, the move highlights CEO Jim Farley\u2019s determination to go toe-to-toe with electric vehicle market leader Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which has already cut the prices on several of its cars this year to boost sales. Farley has already announced plans to triple production of the F-150 Lightning pick-up truck and other EVs by this Fall as he pushes to gain critical market share.\n\nFord\u2019s stock has increased 17% over the past 12 months and is up 33% over the past five years.\n\nMorgan Stanley (MS) The logo for Morgan Stanley is displayed on the side of a building.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother major U.S. lender that just released strong Q2 earnings is investment bank Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS). The company beat expectations on the top- and bottom-lines, announcing earnings per share of $1.24, which was better than the consensus Wall Street forecast for $1.15, according to Refinitiv data. Revenue in the quarter totaled $13.46 billion versus $13.08 billion that had been anticipated by analysts who follow the company.\n\nThe Q2 beat continues a string of success for Morgan Stanley, whose CEO James Gorman has helped to distinguish by focusing on wealth management. That focus has enabled Morgan Stanley to weather a downturn in mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and initial public offerings (IPOs) better than many of its Wall Street peers. While Gorman has announced his intention to retire, he has put the company in an excellent position for continued low-risk growth.\n\nMS stock has gained 16% over the last year and 83% over five years.\n\nCostco (COST) A Costco Wholesale (COST) warehouse in Auburn Hills, Michigan.\n\nSource: ilzesgimene / Shutterstock.com\n\nGrocery retailer Costco (NASDAQ:COST) has proven that it can weather just about any storm the market throws at it. Having sailed through the Covid-19 pandemic, Costco has remained a durable long-term investment thanks to the loyalty of its customers, each of whom pay an annual membership fee to shop at its more than 850 warehouse club locations. Costco currently has a membership renewal rate of 92.6%, which is the envy of the entire retail sector.\n\nTaking a page from streaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Costco is cracking down on the practice of consumers sharing membership cards. In addition to asking shoppers for their membership cards at the cash registers when they checkout, company employees will also request cards with a photo at self-checkout registers, and to view photo identification if a shopper\u2019s membership card does not have a picture. This crackdown should help boost Costco even further, say analysts.\n\nCOST stock has risen 22% this year and is up 154% over five years.\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) the American Express logo etched into wood\n\nSource: First Class Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nCredit card company American Express (NYSE:AXP) is another blue-chip stock that has a long track record of providing shareholders with steady gains. Sentiment towards AXP stock has been improving, as the global economy continues to recover from the pandemic, and a so-called \u201csoft landing\u201d for the U.S. economy looks increasingly likely. Consulting firm McKinsey& Co. said in a report earlier this year that credit card spending is now back to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nIn the first quarter of this year, American Express posted earnings per share of $2.74, which was up dramatically from 41 cents a share a year earlier, and handily beat analyst estimates of $1.61 per share in earnings. While overall revenue at the company declined 12% to $9 billion during Q1, spending on goods and services using American Express cards rose 6% from the previous year.\n\nAXP stock has gained 25% over the last 12 months and has increased 77% over the past five years.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) A McDonald's (MCD) burger box and fries rest on a flat surface.\n\nSource: 8th.creator / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvestors could do worse than to bet on McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD). The Golden Arches has been a solid defensive stock to own for decades.\n\nOver the past 12 months, MCD stock has gained 16% and the share price is up 85% over five years. The largest quick service restaurant chain in the world with more than 40,000 outlets, McDonald\u2019s can be counted on to provide strong earnings in any environment. For this year\u2019s first quarter, the company reported earnings per share of $2.63 versus $2.33 that had been forecast on Wall Street.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s revenue in Q1 came in at $5.90 billion compared to $5.59 billion that was expected among analysts that track the company.\u00a0In its home market of America, higher menu prices and increased traffic fueled same-store sales growth that topped estimates of 7.9%. It was the third consecutive quarter that McDonald\u2019s U.S. traffic rose, showing that the company has strong pricing power, or the ability to lift prices without losing customers.\u00a0McDonald\u2019s traditionally does well during times of economic uncertainty as consumers seek out its cheaper meals.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held a long position in BAC.

The pop came after JNJ beat on its top and bottom lines, reporting second-quarter revenue of $25.5 billion and earnings of $2.80 per share. The company also lifted its full-year forecast.\n\nOn the flip side, Netflix stock fell 8.4% after its quarterly results. While there were lots of positives in the report \u2013 a gain of 5.9 million new subscribers thanks to its password-sharing crackdown, an upwardly revised free cash flow forecast due to the dual strikes currently underway by Hollywood actors and writers, and a big profit beat \u2013 the company fell short on the top line. Specifically, NFLX reported revenue of $8.2 billion, below both the company forecast and analysts' estimates.\n\nTesla stock also declined following its Q2 results, ending the day down 9.7%. The electric vehicle (EV) maker reported higher-than-expected earnings of 91 cents per share. Revenue of $24.9 billion also came in above estimates. However, TSLA's gross margins of 18.2% were lower than anticipated, while its operating margin fell to 9.6% from 11.4% in Q1.\n\nOn the economic front, initial jobless claims fell by 9,000 last week to a two-month low of 237,000. \"Markets are tumbling on fears that reports of a strong labor market alongside weaker earnings will cause the Fed to remain hawkish and push the country into recession in the name of reaching 2% inflation,\" says Jos\u00e9 Torres, senior economist at Interactive Brokers.\n\nAt the close, the Nasdaq was down 2.1% at 14,063, while the S&P 500 was off 0.7% at 4,534. The Dow, however, finished up 0.5% at 35,225 to mark a ninth straight win, its longest such streak since September 2017.\n\nEV stocks remain poised for growth\n\nTesla's second-quarter earnings report certainly disappointed investors, but the company's growth in the electric vehicle space cannot be denied. TSLA has seen its annual earnings per share rise to $4.07 in fiscal 2022 from a per-share loss of 9 cents in fiscal 2018, while revenue nearly quadrupled over that same time frame to $81.5 million. Plus, Tesla delivered over 466,000 vehicles in Q2 2023, nearly doubling deliveries from the year prior.\n\nThe industry is expected to see accelerated growth over the next decade, too, as more automakers shift to battery-powered vehicles. S&P Global Mobility, for one, believes that by 2030, one in four new passenger vehicles sold will be electric. This will undoubtedly result in impressive growth for electric vehicle manufacturers and their suppliers.\n\nWhile artificial intelligence (AI) stocks have been the hot topic around Wall Street in recent months, investors seeking out the best growth stocks would be wise to keep an eye on the electric vehicle space. Here, we take a look at some of the best EV stocks to capitalize on the expanding industry.\n\nRelated Content\n\nWhat Is the Dow Jones?

A rising automotive parts star whose solar-powered tonneau covers and remote power system are on the horizon,\u00a0Worksport Ltd (NASDAQ: WKSP) just announced an eagerly awaited production update.\n\nWorksport Announces An Eagerly Anticipated Operational Development Update\n\nWith its first assembly line now completed and primed for action, the Company is on track to start production in just three weeks. This is the first of a total of five assembly lines due for completion. With each successive line, Worksport will be expanding its capacit,\u00a0strengthening its positioning and ability to meet the rising demand. CEO Steven Rossi also noted that the launch of subsequent lines will be done in a speedier manner as this milestone is much more than an operational update but rather proof of the company\u2019s commitment to quality, innovation, and growth. With its intellectual portfolio and upcoming Solis solar-powered tonneau cover and its remote power storage COR, Worksport is poised to unlock substantial value to its shareholders, customers and the EV industry as a whole.\n\nTesla\u2019s Quarterly Highlights\n\nDuring its second quarter, Tesla made\u00a0$24.93 billion\u00a0in revenue, topping Refinitiv\u2019s consensus estimate of\u00a0$24.47 billion. However, the incentives and discounts that boosted demand melted the operating margin to\u00a09.6%,\u00a0the lowest for at least the last five quarters. The total gross margin was also low at 18.2% due to a mix of lower pricing and the production ramp up, including its in-house battery cells. Earlier this month, Tesla revealed it delivered 466,140 EVs while producing\u00a0479,700 of them, with these two figures being the closes approximation of its sales.\n\nIn its statement, Tesla management insisted that the operating margin is still healthy as it is being maintained with ongoing cost reduction initiatives, strong performance in energy and services units, as well as ramped up production at the EV maker\u2019s Germany and Tesla facilities that entered the picture last year.\n\nSpeaking of revenues, Tesla\u2019s core EV business expanded\u00a046%\u00a0YoY to\u00a0$21.27 billion, increasing 6.5% sequentially. But it was less than the 83% rise in EVs sold which confirms that Tesla\u2019s strategy of lowering prices has boosted demand. These figures exclude the impact of sale of regulatory credits.\n\nEnergy generation and storage brought\u00a0$1.51 billion to the revenue table, rising 74% YoY. As for services and other revenue, including fees for \u2018out-of-warranty\u2019 repairs, this segment expanded 47% to $2.15 billion as more of its EVs had hit the road.\n\nGAAP net income\u00a0rose 20% YoY as it amounted to\u00a0$2.70 billion\u00a0adjusted91 cents per share\u00a0on the strength of non-core income, topping Refinitiv\u2019s consensus estimate of\u00a082 cents per share. On the other hand, operating income dropped 3% YoY to\u00a02.40 billion\u00a0with\u00a0research and development costs rising from Q1\u2019s $771 million to\u00a0\u00a0$943 million as Tesla races to the forefront of AI development, kicking off production of its Dojo super computers.\n\nWhy Was The Market So\u00a0Displeased With Tesla?\n\nThe initial report didn\u2019t destabilize the stock price which actually began to drop during the earnings call and therefore, based on what Tesla CEO Elon Musk said, or more precisely, failed to say. Although the Cybertruck is in production, the delivery dates are still unknown, along with other information. Musk did provide some specifications such as\u00a0that\u00a0the Cybertruck is going to include plenty of \u201cnew technology,\u201d as it will contain 10,000 \u201cunique parts and processes\u201d. The only time-related data of the sci-fi electric pickup is that high volumes will happen next year, while the first candidates are still due for delivery this year.\n\nOn a less bright note, Tesla executives also warned during the call that vehicle production will slow down during the undergoing quarter due to significant factory upgrades and summer shutdowns, causing the stock to drop 5% after hours.\n\nTesla is still aiming to deliver 1.8 million EVs this year, which translates to a\u00a037%\u00a0YoY rise.\n\nDojo\n\nMusk announced that Tesla will be committing more than $1 billion on developing its supercomputer for AI machine learning and computer vision training purposes. In simple words, this is another way in which Tesla will be using technology to enhance the EV experience of its users, upgrading its software and adding new features to its driver assistance system.\n\nMusk Is Not Giving Up On FSD\n\nAmong many of his promises, Musk promised a Full Self-Driving car back in 2016. Although he still didn\u2019t deliver it, he did mention that\u00a0Tesla\u00a0is focused on developing this technology for the U.S. market, saying that he believes Tesla will end this year being better than human. Along with sharing its charging network, Musk also disclosed that Tesla is open to sharing its full self-driving technology, and that it is already in early licensing discussions with a major automotive brand.\n\nTesla shares rose 136% year to Wednesday\u2019s close, showing Musk\u2019s decision to open Tesla\u2019s charging network to other automakers has helped make a turnaround from last year\u2019s 65% value drop.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

Tesla's operating margin also fell below 10% to 9.6%, which is nearly 5% \u2014 493 basis points, to be precise \u2014 below what it was a year ago.\n\n\"The short-term variances in gross margin and profitability really are minor relative to the long-term picture.

Musk also disclosed the company is in early discussions with a \"major OEM\" regarding licensing its full-self driving (FSD) software.

BROWN/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nFrom Wall Street's point of view, the analyst community felt the report and subsequent earnings call provided no major surprises and were better than feared.\n\n\"Overall this was a Goldilocks 2Q print by Musk & Co. given all the noise surrounding the story heading into this quarter,\" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note to clients. Ives also raised his price target to $350 for the stock.\n\n\"We expect the shares to trade modestly lower as the current valuation likely needed a stronger Q2 outcome. That said, no major surprises here either,\" Citi analyst Itay Michaeli said in his analysis.\n\nGuggenheim's Ron Jewsikow, who has a Sell rating on Tesla, was less sanguine.\n\n\"Overall, while the print was better than feared, forward-looking pricing, production, operating leverage, and demand commentary will likely weigh on shares following the considerable run in the stock,\" he said.\n\nFor the second quarter, Tesla reported revenue of $24.9 billion, topping Street estimates for $24.51 billion, with adjusted EPS coming in at $0.91 against estimates for $0.81. That revenue figure represents a slight gain from Q1 and a jump of over 45% from a year ago.\n\nOn the profitability end, Tesla reported adjusted net income of $3.1 billion, compared to estimates of $2.87 billion and more than the $2.9 billion adjusted net income from Q1.\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

If Tesla continues to move lower on decreasing volume, the stock is likely to print a bullish reversal candlestick, such as a doji or hammer candlestick, over the next few days, which could signal a reversal to the upside.\n\nTesla left a gap above between $280.93 and $289.52. Gaps on charts are about 90% likely to fill in the future and when Tesla rebounds to fill the gap, the stock may find at least temporary resistance at the top of the empty trading range. If Tesla finds support at $265.10 and bounces up from that area, the stock will form a triple bottom pattern, when paired with similar price action at that level on July 10 and July 11. If the stock falls under that area, Tesla\u2019s uptrend will be negated and a downtrend could be in the works. Tesla has resistance above at $271.71 and $285.83 and support below at $265.10 and $254.98. screenshot_2586.png\n\nRead Next:\u00a0Jobless Claims Fall More Than Expected, But Investors Still Expect Fed Hike Next Week\n\nPhoto: Courtesy Tesla Inc.\n\nDon't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

Amid competitors like Rivian, Ford and Hummer, Tesla\u2019s Cybertruck held promise on brand name alone.\n\nBe Aware: 8 Electric Cars You May Regret Buying\r\nRead: How To Get Cash Back on Your Everyday Purchases\n\nBut complications arose. Design changes pushed the truck\u2019s release back two years. Now, in 2023, Tesla has made an official statement that they will be rolling out their newest vehicle this year. But is it worth buying? Here\u2019s a closer look at what we know about it.\n\nThe Cybertruck\n\nTesla\u2019s Cybertruck is certainly one of the more unique EV trucks on the market. With its ultra-futuristic design, including no door handles and an electric cover that protects the truck bed with the touch of a button, the Cybertruck has opted for a modern look that raises the bar for EVs. The car boasts other features like rear-wheel steering, allowing for nimble handling in order to maneuver both back country roads and busy urban streets.\n\nMillions of people will buy a Tesla product because of the brand name alone \u2014 as of 2023, 1.9 million individuals have preordered the Cybertruck. Similar to Tesla\u2019s other vehicles early on in their release, it may be difficult to obtain a Cybertruck due to high demand. According to Elon Musk, Tesla will plan to have at least 250,000 Cybertrucks available for purchase.\n\nOther Options: 9 Best Hybrid Cars Under $30K If You\u2019re Unable To Go Fully Electric\n\nShould You Buy It?\n\nIn 2019, Elon Musk announced that the base price for the Cybertruck would be $40,000. The official price of the EV has not been announced yet, but it can be assumed that due to inflation and the current car market, the base price of the Cybertruck will be higher than $40,000.\n\nFor drivers who need a truck bed and are looking for a vehicle with a unique look that is at the forefront of futurism in car design, this might be just the car for you. Compared to the Ford Lightning, which looks similar to the traditional bestselling Ford F-150, Tesla\u2019s Cybertruck is flashy and sleek \u2014 but is also a practical vehicle that serves many purposes.\n\nThe Cybertruck boasts up to 14,000 pounds of towing capacity. This towing capacity is significantly greater than the F-150 Lightning, the Rivian R1T and the Hummer EV Pickup, the three most popular EV trucks on the market today. For work use, the Cybertruck proves to be a very capable vehicle.\n\nWhen it comes to price, the Cybertruck may be the more affordable option compared to other vehicles in its class, assuming the cost is around the originally cited $40,000. For comparison, the F-150 Lightning has a starting price of $49,995, the Rivian R1T starts at $73,000 and the Hummer EV Pickup starts at $85,300.\n\nThose who should buy the Cybertruck are those who enjoy its unique design and are in need of a vehicle with heavy towing capabilities.

While Wall Street is busy with artificial intelligence, these businesses have quietly been improving their financials and their profitability and efficiency these past two years. These growth stocks offer substantial upside potential with consensus price targets, yet receive little attention amidst the focus on AI-related stocks.\n\nHowever, as these overhyped AI stocks start to plateau, many bargain growth stocks (like those listed below) will come into the average investor\u2019s purview. I think that these stocks are among the most overlooked right now. Thus, now\u2019s the time to grab one, or all, of the seven stocks below for those looking to amplify their returns.\n\nLet\u2019s dive into why these seven bargain growth stocks are all buys right now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nChargePoint (CHPT) EV stocks: A close-up shot of a ChargePoint charging station.\n\nSource: YuniqueB / Shutterstock.com\n\nChargePoint (NYSE:CHPT) is one stock I\u2019ll remain bullish on no matter the sentiment. That\u2019s simply because the long-term upside here is tremendous.\n\nElectric vehicles represent a small fraction of total vehicle sales, but there\u2019s clear and significant growth potential in the future. Of course, the market recognizes this, and many EV stocks are trading at substantial premiums right now.\n\nHowever, the ongoing EV boom won\u2019t just propel the automakers. It will also provide substantial tailwinds to battery companies and charging infrastructure providers like ChargePoint. Despite favorable market conditions, the stock has stagnated around $9 per share, offering a compelling risk-reward ratio from my perspective.\n\nOf course, there are still many negative hubbubs here, and I\u2019ll address those. I acknowledge the company\u2019s need to combat strong competition for its 65%-plus market share, but I have low expectations in this regard. Even with a reduced market share, CHPT remains undervalued due to the estimated $77 billion in sector-wide revenue by 2027.\n\nSecond, I am not at all scared of\u00a0Tesla\u2019s (NASDAQ:TSLA) dominance in the EV charging space. ChargePoint operates in many markets worldwide, and the only place Tesla is a threat right now is in the U.S. Compared to competitors EVgo (NASDAQ:EVGO) and Blink (NASDAQ:BLNK), this company\u2019s SaaS model sets it apart by avoiding upfront construction costs.\n\nNevertheless, there is plenty of room for ChargePoint to improve when it comes to profitability. ChargePoint is likely years from positive net income, and it will require a lot of patience for the stock to truly pay off. Still, the consensus price target here is $15.4, implying 77.8% upside. The lowest price target with CHPT stock is $10, above where it currently trades.\n\nJD.Com (JD) JD.com (JD) logo displayed at the entrance to the company's Silicon Valley office.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nJD.Com (NASDAQ:JD) is a major e-commerce player in China, boasting 500 million active customers and approximately 17% market share. Indeed, JD has been sliding lower since Q1 2021, and remains battered. But things are starting to look up as the company reported strong results for the first quarter of 2023, beating analyst expectations. With 1.4% year-over-year revenue growth, the standout metric for this company is its earnings per share. The company surpassed analysts\u2019 expectations on its bottom line by approximately 57%, signaling a potential turnaround.\n\nJD has immense upside potential, given China\u2019s projected online retail sales of $2.8 trillion in 2023, up from $1.9 trillion in 2019 (according to eMarketer). JD has a competitive edge in this market, and there are many reasons why. But one that truly sticks out is that JD is not as exposed to the regulatory risks that have plagued its rival Alibaba (NYSE:BABA). JD has maintained a good relationship with the Chinese authorities, giving JD a lower risk profile, in my opinion.\n\nThe\u00a0consensus price target for JD is $60.55, implying 63% upside from its current price of roughly $37 per share.\n\nNew Fortress Energy (NFE) image of a hand holding a bright light bulb outdoors with trees in the background\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nNew Fortress Energy (NASDAQ:NFE) is a top LNG infrastructure and solutions provider, operating terminals, power plants, and transportation assets in the U.S., Latin America, and the Caribbean. It has also been hammered due to lower energy prices and increasingly negative sentiment toward fossil fuels in general.\n\nHowever, I think NFE\u2019s stock valuation is now too compelling to ignore and is poised to rebound as oil prices slowly start to trend higher. The company trades at only 6.7-times its forward earnings, which are very low multiples for a company that analysts expect will grow its revenue by 30% year-over-year this year, 48% next year, and 34% in 2025.\n\nOf course, I know there are risks. But with such a low valuation, NFE is a solid buy. The rising investments in LNG infrastructure will also position it to capitalize on this growth opportunity.\n\nMoreover, NFE stock offers a dividend to sweeten the deal for investors, and the consensus analyst price target implies a 62.5% upside.\n\nIndeed, one of the top bargain growth stocks in my book.\n\nStoneCo (STNE) Illustration of phone with dollar sign and other graphics symbolizing fintech displayed on and around it, with a blue background. Overvalued tech stocks\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/ZinetroN\n\nStoneCo (NASDAQ:STNE) is a leading fintech company based in Brazil, offering payment processing, banking, software, and credit services to merchants and partners. The fintech company is in the same boat as e-commerce player JD, and could reap the benefits of an e-commerce rebound.\n\nSince late-2022, the company\u2019s stock has faced pressure following disappointing third-quarter results. These results were attributed to lower transaction volumes and increased operating expenses. Plus, investors also fear increased competition from other Latin American rivals such as PagSeguro (NYSE:PAGS) and MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI).\n\nHowever, these negatives are all but priced in, and the downside potential for StoneCo is limited. Trading at 17-times forward earnings and 1.7-times sales, the stock offers an attractive valuation given its strong growth potential. Accordingly, the consensus price target for StoneCo is $15.5, implying 24.4% upside from its current price. In the long run, Gurufocus believes a fair price of $80 is reasonable.\n\nStoneCo has ample room for growth as fintech adoption in Brazil remains low compared to other markets, despite ambitious prospects. Only\u00a027.3% of Brazilians use digital payments regularly, much lower than other large markets like China or India.\n\nTeladoc (TDOC) The Teladoc logo through a magnifying glass.\n\nSource: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nTeladoc (NYSE:TDOC) has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the pandemic-driven shift to online healthcare delivery platforms. The company\u2019s revenue soared during the pandemic, with triple-digit growth in visits, and acquisitions fueling the hype. After a sharp decline in early-2021, the stock price continued to slide in 2022 before stabilizing around $25 per share.\n\nA breakout appears likely, particularly as the company\u2019s mental health segment gains momentum. Mental health is a growing problem that affects millions of people around the world, and is also one that AI cannot solve. Depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide, and Teladoc is well-positioned to address this huge and under-served market. It offers variety of mental health services, such as therapy, psychiatry, coaching, and mindfulness.\n\nTeladoc\u2019s mental health segment is a growing driver that sets it apart from competitors. The downside risk here is also minimal, considering the way this stock has traded in recent months.\n\nEmeren Group (SOL) Solar penny stocks: a close up of a solar cell farm\n\nSource: Fit Ztudio / Shutterstock\n\nEmeren Group (NYSE:SOL) is another solid energy pick right now. The stock has lost over 87% of its value since its 2021 high but is now starting to creep upwards again. Emeren Group is primed to capitalize on solar sector growth, particularly in emerging markets like Latin America, Africa, and Southeast Asia.\n\nThe company\u2019s pivot outside of China is another factor that makes it compelling. Emeren Group aims to generate 63% of its revenue from Europe this year, distinguishing itself from other renewable energy companies susceptible to a potential Chinese economic downturn.\n\nThe stock is also trading at only 10-times its forward earnings, which are very cheap levels for a solar-energy startup. Accordingly, the consensus price target for SOL implies a whopping 149% upside from its current price. Simply put, the entry point is too tempting here.\n\nAmerican Airlines (AAL) American Airlines plane on ramp in Chicago Airport. American Airlines is amongst the airlines cancelling flights\n\nSource: GagliardiPhotography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmerican Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) may not be commonly associated with growth stocks, but its impressive recovery has been overlooked for an extended period. The stock has continued to languish around 35% below its pre-pandemic price amidst a travel boom and surge in its top line. You\u2019d be paying just over 6-times forward earnings per share, which is nothing short of a bargain.\n\nI do recognize that the travel boom is cooling off, and it won\u2019t last forever. However, American\u2019s valuation is too compelling to ignore. It is a well-established company that will eventually bounce back higher, especially as it has been reducing its debt rapidly.\n\nAnalysts\u00a0expect sales growth to come in at 7.8% year-over-year and then stabilize around 4% for the next two years. That\u2019s nothing to scoff at, since AAL stock traded at a much higher valuation with much lower growth in the pre-pandemic era.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

However, the stock is down -8% in trading Thursday morning nonetheless, as investors fixated on shrinking operating margins, which fell below 10%.\n\nRecord-breaking production, deliveries, and revenue, which neared $25 billion for the quarter, weren\u2019t enough to excite investors, and for good reason. One of the big promises for Tesla\u2019s long-term success is high margins, which would put it in a class above the typical auto manufacturer. Tesla bulls liken the EV maker to the new Apple, who boasts 25% net margins. But if TSLA can\u2019t reach those high expectations the company may no longer deserve its exceptionally high earnings multiple.\n\nTesla\u2019s stock performance over the last decade is nothing short of extraordinary, compounding at 42% annually over that period. And really, it was in the last five years that much of the outperformance can be attributed to. But, if margins can\u2019t expand over the coming quarters, those returns are unlikely to resume. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nPlenty of Good News\n\nTesla has long been mired in doubt, and its potential loudly dismissed by those who scrutinize Musk and his companies. Yet the stock has been one of the best performers in the whole market, ascending to one of the largest companies in the world.\n\nBesides the compression in margins, the rest of the company information couldn\u2019t appear more promising.\n\nThanks to Tesla\u2019s ramp in new factories, in Q2 alone the EV manufacturer produced 480,000 cars, an 86% YoY increase. It also increased its supercharger stations by 33% in the last year and is on the path to being the standard for EV charging, opening another potentially massive business venue.\n\nThe company continues to invest heavily in research and development and is one of the leading companies in the integration of AI technology. Furthermore, the 4680 battery cell, Tesla\u2019s proprietary battery technology, will be another major addition in its effort to\u00a0 vertically integrate, and increase production efficiency.\n\nEarnings rocketed higher starting in 2020 and haven\u2019t looked back. It was really at this moment where the bear\u2019s thesis began to unravel, and Musk\u2019s long-term plan became more evident. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nCybertruck and Compact Car?\n\nYes, it seems the Cybertruck is really coming. A reported 1.7 million people have preordered the truck, which is expected to begin selling to the public with the next 6 months.\n\nAlthough exciting as the new vehicle\u2019s introduction will be, it is only a small piece of Tesla\u2019s grand vision. The most critical product coming from Tesla will be its compact car, which should eventually solidify its dominance of the industry.\n\nThe compact EV is slated to go on sale sometime in 2026 and will cost just $25,000. Musk hopes this vehicle will become the new Honda Civic and should expand Tesla\u2019s appeal to more than just the US market, but also the developing economies of the world.\n\nBottom Line\n\nTesla is and will likely always be a conundrum, a stock that defies traditional models, and confounds investors. When Musk is supposed to be distracted by his new toy, Twitter, Tesla goes and posts record revenue and production volume. Massive sales growth is supposed to overwhelm production and ruin quality control, the Model 3 and Y show 100% YoY sales growth.

Musk Tesla\u2019s massive need for high-powered Nvidia chips during Tesla\u2019s Q2 earnings call, during which he discussed the company\u2019s custom-built supercomputer.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re using a lot of Nvidia hardware,\u201d Musk said during the earnings call. \u201cWe\u2019ll actually take Nvidia hardware as fast as Nvidia will deliver it to us. Tremendous respect for [CEO] Jensen [Huange] and Nvidia. They\u2019ve done an incredible job.\u201d\n\nShares of both Nvidia and Tesla were down 2% and 7%, respectively, Wednesday along with the rest of the broader market and tech sector.\n\nAccording to Musk, Nvidia has too many customers vying for its products. And while the company has prioritized some of Tesla\u2019s orders, Nvidia can\u2019t provide as many chips as the electric automaker requires.\n\nTesla has worked with Nvidia for years, and the electric automaker already runs a Nvidia-powered supercomputer. But because of the boom in AI, demand for Nvidia\u2019s chips is pressuring customers like Tesla. Nvidia Corp Chief Executive Jensen Huang speaks at the COMPUTEX forum in Taipei, Taiwan May 29, 2023. REUTERS/Ann Wang\n\nTo address this, Musk says Tesla is building its own supercomputer, called Dojo, that runs on custom silicon. The company says its beginning construction of the machine this month.\n\n\u201cIf [Nvidia] could deliver us enough GPUs, we might not need Dojo, but they can\u2019t,\u201d Musk said.\n\nNvidia is benefiting handsomely from the AI boom, and its growth is unlikely to slow anytime soon. Tesla\u2019s need for Nvidia, and its own hardware, also points to the wide breadth of the AI market and variety of use cases which range from Musk\u2019s pursuit of self-driving vehicles to smart home systems.\n\nThe current explosive interest in AI kicked off when OpenAI debuted its ChatGPT generative AI chatbot in Nov. 2022. One of the fastest growing apps in history, ChatGPT jump started a generative AI revolution. Microsoft (MSFT), which is investing billions in OpenAI, used the company\u2019s technology in its Bing chatbot and Edge web browser it launched in February. Sign up for the Yahoo Finance newsletter.\n\nGoogle parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) followed that news with its own AI announcements during its Google I/O conference in May. Meta (META) is already working on its own generative AI capabilities, and according to Bloomberg, Apple (AAPL) is also developing its version of the technology.\n\nShares of Microsoft and Alphabet are up 45% and 36%, respectively, year to date. Nvidia\u2019s shares are up a whopping 214% thanks in part to the fact that it\u2019s the market leader in AI chips that companies need to train and operate their AI platforms.\n\nDuring its first quarter earnings report, Nvidia issued second quarter guidance that blew away Wall Street\u2019s expectations. The company says it will bring in $11 billion in revenue in the current quarter plus or minus 2%. Wall Street anticipated $7.2 billion.\n\nWe\u2019ll see if it meets or exceeds those expectations when the company reports its earnings on Aug. 23.\n\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

They counterbalance riskier segments, making them go-to stocks for long-term gains and stability in your investment portfolio.\n\nHere are seven of the best long-term holdings I would put in the \u201cforever\u201d bucket.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon (AMZN) logo on a corporate building\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmong the constellation of tech titans, e-commerce behemoth Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) shines bright. Following a period of prudent cost cutting and headcount reduction, the firm\u2019s financials are primed for an uplift. Resilience is evident, given the company\u2019s impressive 9.4% year-over-year revenue increase in both its e-commerce and cloud segments.\n\nThe broad shift towards digitization and AI presents a golden opportunity for the firm, especially with its expansive customer data pool. By enhancing search functionalities and expanding its AI toolkit for AWS, the company is well-prepared to ride the digital wave to new highs.\n\nAmazon\u2019s AWS division experienced a strong 16% year-over-year growth despite the projected slowdown in cloud computing. With AWS targeting a $2.5 trillion untapped market, its growth trajectory remains solidly intact.\n\nMGM\u00a0(MGM) A photo of the MGM logo on the MGM casino building.\n\nSource: Michael Neil Thomas / Shutterstock.com\n\nOn the surface, most investors might not consider\u00a0MGM (NYSE:MGM) as a forever stock. Gambling is seen as a discretionary pastime. However, what may be widely considered to be a more transient customer base has turned into a more stable one. That\u2019s partly due to MGM\u2019s recent moves to tap into online casino betting and sports wagering through BetMGM, capitalizing on the shifting gambling preferences of millions of Americans.\n\nAdditionally, as the allure of online betting endures, BetMGM could become incredibly profitable even when economic conditions become stormy. Growth and profitability both remain strong for this gaming giant, outpacing 5-year historical and sector averages.\n\nLas Vegas, MGM\u2019s home turf and a popular vacation spot, consistently attracts visitors with new attractions, enhancing its appeal. Hence, MGM is poised to reap the long-term benefits of continued in-person and online growth in this sector.\n\nServiceNow\u00a0(NOW) ServiceNow office building in Silicon Valley;\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) is a major player in cloud computing and digital workflow management software. Notably, the company surpassed expectations this past quarter, raising its 2023 forecast. The firm posted strong 24% year-over-year revenue growth in the latest quarter while also doubling its net income, showcasing potent growth.\n\nThe cloud computing market, projected to reach $2.4 trillion by 2030, offers significant untapped potential for top players like ServiceNow. With a vast client base of over 7,700 global enterprises, ServiceNow currently holds 1,682 annual contracts over $1 million apiece, putting this company above 85% of the top Fortune 500 companies.\n\nCEO Bill McDermott continues to underscore ServiceNow\u2019s versatile software, leveraged for cost efficiency and growth. Impressively, this company\u2019s management team is forecasting 23% to 23.5% service revenue growth in 2023. With numbers like those, it\u2019s impossible to say that ServiceNow\u2019s future is anything but bright.\n\nMicrosoft\u00a0(MSFT) The Microsoft (MSFT) logo on a corporate office building during the day time.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) ongoing investments in AI, and ties to OpenAI (the brains behind ChatGPT) marks a major step toward the future. Picture Microsoft\u2019s potent software capabilities amplified by AI, improving the speed, intelligence, and intuition of its product set.\n\nEarlier this year, Microsoft took the tech world by storm, investing a massive $10 billion in OpenAI. Having integrated ChatGPT into Bing search, Microsoft aims to enhance its software stack with the transformative capabilities of AI.\n\nDriven by AI-enabled expansion, Microsoft\u2019s potential for growth is as robust as ever, even amidst market saturation.\u00a0The first quarter of 2023 saw a 16% rise in Intelligent Cloud revenue, with this segment hitting a remarkable $22.1 billion in sales. I expect that number to continue climbing over the next several quarters as Microsoft layers in AI into its massive product base and cloud offering.\n\nNextEra Energy\u00a0(NEE) Nextra Energy (NEE) website on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\n\nNextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE), a global leader in wind and solar energy production, continues to provide very strong performance as far as renewable energy companies are concerned. The company\u2019s clean energy investments drive solid and consistent growth, while its regulated utility business ensures steady earnings and cash flow.\n\nNextEra stands out among renewable energy companies, given its dominant position in key markets. NextEra is a key player in markets such as Florida, with a number of notable solar and wind utilities. NextEra\u2019s appeal grows with increasing data center demand and climate-related heat in Florida, where most utility customers reside.\n\nNextEra operates an A-graded profitability and growth profile, which boasts double-digit growth across key metrics. On top of that, NEE stock offers a mighty attractive dividend, with 27 years of growth in payouts and a 2.5% yield.\n\nAbbVie\u00a0(ABBV) Closeup of AbbVie (ABBV) building corporate office, an American biopharmaceutical company with its headquarters in Lake Bluff, Illinois, USA\n\nSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com\n\nAbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) is a renowned pharmaceutical company, offering a generous dividend of $1.48 per share, or a yield of 4.3%. Despite the recent sell-off caused by Humira\u2019s patent expiration and generic competition, savvy investors see an enticing long-term opportunity to capitalize on the stock\u2019s impressive return profile.\n\nDespite patent issues, AbbVie has maintained consistent robust performance due to its pipeline of drugs. The company\u2019s sought-after medications like RINVOQ for rheumatoid arthritis and Lexapro for anxiety-depression provide very consistent cash flows. Moreover, its strategic acquisition of Allergan brought the youth-preserving neurotoxic protein Botox under AbbVie\u2019s wing. Botox has been a remarkably popular cosmetics treatment over the years and will continue to grow in popularity over time.\n\nAs AbbVie continues to grow organically and via acquisitions, this is a stock that should continue to reward investors with both capital appreciation and dividend-related upside.\u00a0The company\u2019s pipeline teems with promising new medications awaiting various approval stages. As these get approved, investors stand to reap the benefits.\n\nTesla\u00a0(TSLA) Tesla Motors (TSLA) now an SP500 company with a busy Pond Springs location in northwest Austin, TX\n\nSource: Roschetzky Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn the realm of electric vehicles,\u00a0Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) reigns supreme. This is a stock that\u2019s historically provided tremendous long-term upside potential, with this year being no different. At the time of writing, TSLA stock has more than doubled this year, becoming a poster child for formidable growth. The automaker exceeded expectations again in the third quarter, beating estimates, but posting slightly lower margins due to an aggressive pricing strategy.\n\nCurrently, Tesla\u2019s pricing strategy seems to be a winning move, driving demand amidst a landscape teeming with rival EV brands. Given its massive success of late, it\u2019s like Tesla has its GPS for success, perpetually a mile ahead of the competition.\n\nA notable turning point for the company occurred when CEO Elon Musk shifted his focus back to the electric car pioneer, away from Twitter. Consequently, we see how Tesla stock is roaring back, adding another layer to its burgeoning growth story.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nMuslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

Bernie Sanders is sounding the alarm.\n\nIn an op-ed titled \"This year is set to be the hottest in history. Congress must act now\" for The Guardian, Sanders pointed out that the past eight years have been the warmest ever documented.\n\nAnd the world has to grapple with more than just summer heat.\n\n\"Climate change is ravaging the planet,\" he wrote. \"We are now seeing floods, droughts, extreme weather disturbances and wildfires causing unprecedented damage.\"\n\nSanders explained that the imminent consequences of climate change include accelerated Arctic ice cap melting, rising sea levels and heightened flooding. The changes will increase droughts, disrupt food production and intensify storm damage. Economic downturns and mass migration because of water shortages are expected as well.\n\n\"Instead of denying this obvious reality, instead of doing the bidding of oil and coal companies, instead of fomenting a new cold war with China, members of Congress must develop an unprecedented sense of urgency about this global crisis,\" he said.\n\nWhile Sanders made a compelling call to action, some corporations have already risen to the challenge. Here's a look at three green stocks that are actively tackling the issue.\n\nCheck out:\n\nInvesting in real estate just got a whole lot simpler. This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes and you only need $100. This real estate fund isn\u2019t only providing incredible returns to its investors, but also helping its tenants build wealth. See why this \u2018people first' strategy could disrupt the rental market.\n\nTesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)\n\nAccording to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), 28% of America's greenhouse gas emissions in 2021 came from the transportation sector \u2014 and particularly from burning fossil fuels for cars, trucks, ships, trains and planes.\n\nThe EPA estimates that a typical passenger vehicle emits approximately 4.6 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year.\n\nTesla is helping resolve the issue by producing electric vehicles (EVs), which have no tailpipe emissions.\n\nThe company is making an impact. In the second quarter of 2023, it delivered 466,140 vehicles, representing an 83% increase year over year.\n\nTesla has been one of the more volatile names in the stock market. Shares fell 65% in 2022 but are up 170% in 2023.\n\nFirst Solar Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR)\n\nSolar energy can play a significant role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. One reason is that it produces no emissions during the power generation process. And according to the United Nations, life-cycle assessments of solar power \"clearly demonstrate that it has a smaller carbon footprint from \u2018cradle-to-grave' than fossil fuels.\"\n\nFirst Solar's solutions help humans harness the power of the sun. The company produces solar panels, including those used in utility-scale solar power plants.\n\nThe business brought in $548 million in net sales in the first quarter of 2023. For the full year, net sales are projected to be between $3.4 billion and $3.6 billion.\n\nThe stock market had a choppy ride over the past year, but First Solar investors probably aren't complaining. Over the past 12 months, shares have surged more than 180%.\n\nNextEra Energy Partners LP (NYSE:NEP)\n\nNextEra Energy Partners was created by energy company NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE) to own, manage and acquire clean energy projects that generate steady cash flows.\n\nToday, NextEra Energy Partners' portfolio holds interests in wind, solar and energy storage projects in the U.S., along with natural gas infrastructure assets in Texas and Pennsylvania.\n\nBecause natural gas is not considered a renewable energy source, NextEra Energy Partners is not a renewables pure-play. But it recently announced plans to become one.\n\n\"To lead this transition, we are launching a process to sell our natural gas pipeline assets, and we are suspending incentive distribution rights fees to NextEra Energy through 2026,\" John Ketchum, chairman and CEO of NextEra Energy Partners, said in a press release.\n\nThe partnership also stands out for its cash payout to investors.\n\nNextEra Energy Partners currently pays quarterly distributions of 84.25 cents per share, giving the stock an annual yield of 5.7%. Management expects to grow the distribution per unit by 12% to 15% per year through at least 2026, although they mentioned that given the current capital market environment, the growth rate will probably be \"at or near the bottom end of this range.\"\n\nNextEra Energy Partners stock is down about 16% in 2023. If you like oversized dividends but aren't a fan of the volatility associated with publicly traded companies, you might want to look into reliable income plays outside the stock market \u2014 such as investing in rental properties with as little as $100 while staying completely hands-off.\n\nRead next:\n\nThis Former Google Engineer Built A Platform That Lets You Buy Shares Of Single-Family Rentals With The Click Of A Button Elon Musk Is Bullish On Austin.

Gianarikas notes that \u201cbuying a Tesla without the full self-driving software will be like buying an iPhone without an internet connection.\" By ceding units out into the market and investing in software upgrades, Tesla is putting capital to work to create long-term durable growth, Gianarikas argues.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/video/tesla-investing-future-growth-margins-155930463.html", "symbols": ["TL0.F", "TL0.XETRA", "TSLA.MX", "TSLA.US", "TSLA34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.077, "neg": 0.082, "neu": 0.833, "pos": 0.085}}, {"date": "2023-07-20T15:59:00+00:00", "title": "Tesla\u2019s Earnings\u2014Why Wall Street and Investors Disagree About the Quarter", "content": "Tesla's earnings were fine, which leaves Wall Street analysts some room to think about the electric-vehicle maker's other businesses, including self-driving cars and artificial intelligence.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/m/d1d39fae-8c05-3bd2-baae-a45245e8b56c/tesla%E2%80%99s-earnings%E2%80%94why-wall.html", "symbols": ["TL0.F", "TL0.XETRA", "TSLA.MX", "TSLA.US", "TSLA34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.599, "neg": 0, "neu": 0.824, "pos": 0.176}}, {"date": "2023-07-20T15:45:42+00:00", "title": "25 Millionaire-Maker AI Stocks to Buy Now", "content": "To say that artificial intelligence is transforming the world would be a drastic understatement. The launch of ChatGPT has pushed AI into full focus, with the chatbot reaching 1 million users in less than one week. This new technology is revolutionizing entire fields, performing many human tasks from office work to construction. It is also helping companies take significant steps forward toward producing fully autonomous vehicles. Whether you\u2019re excited by the rise of AI or nervous about what it will mean for the future of humanity, it is impossible not to pay attention to it. For investors, this means assessing the best AI stocks to buy as the market\u2019s newest gold rush continues\n\nInvestorPlace analyst Luke Lango sees tremendous opportunity in the new AI boom. He recently described the industry as having a moment similar to the release of the iPhone, which changed everything for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). In his words:\n\n\u201cThe AI megatrend is just getting started. ChatGPT really kickstarted this AI frenzy back in November 2022. We\u2019re basically just seven months into the AI Boom. By comparison, the Internet Boom lasted almost 10 years \u2013 from the launch of the world\u2019s first website in 1991 to the peak of the dot-com bubble in 2000.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCompared to other big booms like gold in the 1970s, housing in the 2000s, and cryptos in the 2010s, this AI Boom is still both relatively young and small. It has a lot of runway ahead of it.\u201d\n\nMore and more companies are embracing the new technology, implementing machine learning and generative AI in their operations and products.\n\nThis means that the best AI stocks to buy aren\u2019t always firms that operate strictly in the space. Companies across multiple sectors can offer investors exposure to the booming market as they double down on AI investment.\n\nWhat are the best buys for investors seeking to cash in? Let\u2019s take a closer look at the best AI stocks that still have room to run.\n\nAI Stocks to Buy: Adobe (ADBE) Adobe logo on wall of corporate building.\n\nSource: r.classen / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile it\u2019s perhaps best known as the maker of Photoshop, Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) has a long history of innovation in the graphic design and document management space. It surged during the Covid-19 pandemic of 2020, and while ADBE stock has since come down, it is making impressive progress, up 50% in 2023. It has demonstrated strong fundamentals, reporting better-than-expected earnings for Q2 2023. As a result, Wall Street analysts are optimistic about its growth prospects heading into the second half of the year.\n\nThe AI boom should give investors and analysts even more reason to embrace ADBE stock.\n\nAs the economy transitions toward further reliance on AI, Adobe is primed to ride this wave to the top. It is incorporating generative AI into its well-known products. In May 2023, it added AI as a \u201cCreative Co-Pilot\u201d to Photoshop to enhance the beloved software\u2019s features. This will likely make it an even more popular tool among graphic design professionals and other creatives who depend upon it, making ADBE a clear choice among AI stocks to buy.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Google launches Bard AI. Google search bar on a phone in hand with release information on background. Google Bard AI vs OpenAI ChatGPT. GOOG stock and GOOGL stock.\n\nSource: salarko / Shutterstock.com\n\nAll Silicon Valley giants are working overtime to help spur the AI revolution. It\u2019s no surprise that Google\u2019s parent company would be at the forefront.\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) got off to a somewhat rocky start when its AI chatbot Bard displayed clear misinformation. However, the company\u2019s significant progress on the AI front shouldn\u2019t go unappreciated.\n\nIn the months since, Google hasn\u2019t slowed down in its quest to dominate this market. As the MIT Technology Review reports, it\u2019s \u201cthrowing generative AI at everything,\u201d applying it to products both past and present. Google\u2019s PaLM 2 language model is already part of 25 products, including Google Maps, Google Sheets and Gmail. The company plans on using this new tech to help improve the user search experience too.\n\nNo matter where the AI market goes from here, Alphabet will lead the movement. It has the size and resources to invest in research and development wherever it needs to and scale production at any time.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon logistics center in Szczecin, Poland.\n\nSource: Mike Mareen / Shutterstock.com\n\nFor all the attention it has received, the modern AI revolution did not begin with ChatGPT. It really began when Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) introduced the world to its Alexa device in 2014. Since then, the world has become accustomed to turning on lights, music and many other things through voice commands. Years later, Amazon has only redoubled its focus in AI, using it to optimize its products and services. The company is working to increase the speed at which it delivers packages by using AI to help it strategically place inventory.\n\nUnlike many of its Big Tech rivals, Amazon isn\u2019t necessarily trying to produce a chatbot of its own to rival ChatGPT. Moreover, it has decided to provide users with the tools they need to build their own. It responded to the rise of the chatbot by adding two new AI language models to its Amazon Web Services platform.\n\nAmazon is also highly focused on robotics. It is attempting to acquireiRobot (NASDAQ:IRBT), the company behind the Roomba vacuum cleaner. More recently, it announced a partnership with AI startup Hugging Face, a software development hub that counts many tech sector giants as clients. Like Alphabet, Amazon is in an excellent position to continue growing by cornering new parts of the AI market.\n\nAutodesk (ADSK) An Autodesk (ADSK) sign on an office in Toronto, Canada.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nContrary to its name, Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) doesn\u2019t operate strictly in the automotive space. It is actually a dynamic software producer that supports many companies across multiple sectors, primarily serving architects and engineers. Its primary software products are Revit and Fusion 360, which are geared toward architectural design and manufacturing. These programs help make Autodesk a great bet for investors seeking AI exposure. As InvestorPlace contributor Vandita Jadeja reports:\n\n\u201cThese two are the main products of the company and using generative AI for the same will pay off in the long-term. Through these tools, engineers can set a range of parameters and have the software run simulations. It can save a lot of time and money. Its products can build structures and 3D animations which will help meet the changing demands of the industry.\u201d\n\nIt may not be a name that immediately comes to mind when someone thinks of AI stocks to buy. That said, Autodesk\u2019s technology is likely to see a surge in demand as the AI revolution continues to develop.\n\nAs Jadeja also notes, it successfully meets the needs of a very large industry and one in which there isn\u2019t much competition. Additionally, the company boasts strong financials and encouraging growth prospects. While ADSK stock has been fairly volatile over the past year, it is poised to ride the AI boom to new heights.\n\nAI Stocks to Buy: Baidu (BIDU) Home page of the popular website Chinese search engine company Baidu (BIDU) on the screen of the Chinese smartphone Xiaomi in the male hand\n\nSource: Andrey Solovev / Shutterstock.com\n\nA leader in China\u2019s tech market, Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) has a reach that spans many sectors, including IT, electronics and electric vehicles. It stands to reason that such a dynamic tech company would be focused on incorporating AI into its operations and Baidu is doing exactly that. But this Chinese tech innovator is taking it further and attempting to develop its own answer to ChatGPT. It recently claimed that its Ernie AI model has outperformed the chatbot \u201cin comprehensive ability scores\u201d and outperformed \u201cGPT-4 in several Chinese capabilities.\u201d\n\nBaidu\u2019s plans for AI don\u2019t stop at its chatbot, though. It is making significant progress delivering driverless taxis to various Chinese cities. And while some companies are acquiring AI startups, Baidu has announced plans to roll out a venture fund to invest in companies that focus on AI applications that generate content. This could give it valuable exposure to some of the market\u2019s hottest new AI innovators before they go public, thereby sending shares soaring.\n\nAs InvestorPlace contributor Chris MacDonald noted, while U.S. investors often overlook BIDU stock, the AI boom is a great reminder why they shouldn\u2019t.\n\nBerkshire Grey (BGRY) a worker with a tablet remotely operates a standalone robot arm. Get Rich with Robotics\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThis little-known penny stock is one of the companies helping shape the future of work.\n\nDespite its name, Berkshire Grey (NASDAQ:BGRY) isn\u2019t owned by Warren Buffett. Based in Massachusetts, this AI innovator produces intelligent robotic automation solutions for industries such as e-commerce and retail. As noted, industry-leader Amazon is focused on optimizing AI to help reduce operating costs and maximize shipping efficiency. This means that companies in Berkshire Grey\u2019s space will likely see a surge in demand for their robotic solutions as these trends take over and human workers are gradually phased out.\n\nBRGY stock has been fairly volatile lately, but it currently trades at less than $1.50 per share. That should be highly enticing for investors who can stomach some risk. Penny stocks can make potential buyers nervous, but there are some key reasons to be optimistic about Berkshire Grey. As InvestorPlace contributor Alex Sirois reports, it touts \u201cimpressive productivity increases, including a 70% reduction in overhead costs and 90% faster truck unload times for its customers.\u201d Amazon and its peers are likely to take notice and when they do, BGRY could skyrocket out of the penny stock category.\n\nBYD Company (BYDDY) Close-up of BYD (BYDDY) logo on red car, symbolizing BYDDY stock\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Trygve Finkelsen\n\nOne of the most exciting aspects of the AI revolution is the possibility that it will take us to a future with driverless cars.\n\nElectric vehicle producers are laser-focused on reaching this goal before their competitors do. While Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is getting most of the attention, investors would be better served to focus on other automakers. BYD Company (OTCMKTS:BYDDY) is quietly leading China\u2019s EV race and it is doubling down on incorporating AI in its vehicles. It has partnered with industry-leading chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) to bring the cutting edge DRIVE Orin platform to its new energy vehicles.\n\nMore recently, the company took a major step forward when it partnered with AI and metaverse innovator MeetKai. On July 11, the latter announced the launch of BYD World, an \u201cinteractive virtual dealership experience dedicated to providing new opportunities for customers to interact with the BYD brand and its products in Americas.\u201d This could be BYD\u2019s ticket into the U.S. market after it has already sold more vehicles than Tesla in China. This type of innovation makes it an excellent bet among both EV and AI stocks to buy as it gears up to expand its global reach. It has been touted as having the potential to reach a trillion-dollar valuation.\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) Mobile phone with website of American software company CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) Inc. on screen in front of website. Focus on top-center of phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nWe can\u2019t talk about markets being changed by AI without discussing cybersecurity. CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) has been dominating that field for years, offering cybersecurity and data protection. Now AI is poised to help improve the tech solutions upon which many companies depend. Forbes reports that \u201c76% of enterprises have prioritized AI and machine learning in their IT budgets.\u201d Additionally, demand for cybersecurity services is growing faster than the human workforce. This means that the\u00a0 firms prioritizing AI will have a clear advantage. And CrowdStrike is at the forefront of this movement. It recently introduced Charlotte AI, a generative AI analyst created to help users navigate its CrowdStrike Falcon platform.\n\nThis isn\u2019t CrowdStrike\u2019s first foray into AI, either. Far from it. In August 2022, the company rolled out AI-powered indicators of attack (IOAs), created by \u201ccloud-native machine learning models.\u201d On top of that, CRWD has continuously earned its place among both cybersecurity and AI stocks to buy.\n\nGitLab (GTLB) The GitLab (GTLB) logo on an iPhone screen.\n\nSource: Lori Butcher / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe current AI-centric economic landscape puts companies like GitLab (NASDAQ:GTLB) in a perfect position. For years, this innovative DevOps platform has helped tech developers and teams build software. It enables collaboration which has been of paramount importance in the age of remote work. Now, more and more companies are rushing to enter the AI race while entrepreneurs are scrambling to build the next great AI startup. Both these trends stand to create significant demand for a platform like GitLab. As Sirois notes:\n\n\u201cThe reason that investors are so focused on GitLab is clear. The company has rapidly added AI features to its platform (10 recently), and posted revenue that was $9 million above analyst expectations, at $127 million. GitLab\u2019s CEO Sid Sijbrandij was resolute in his belief that AI will help GitLab to make software for organizations faster than it could prior.\u201d\n\nAI Stocks to Buy: First Solar (FSLR) First Solar logo on smartphone in front of computer screen with graphs. FSLR stock\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nDespite some volatility over the past six months, First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR) has repeatedly proven that it can\u2019t be kept down. This clean energy leader has risen more than 35% year to date (YTD). While it may not instantly come to mind when you think of AI stocks, that doesn\u2019t mean it should be counted out.\n\nLike all innovative manufacturers, First Solar has found ways to incorporate AI into its production to help improve its output and efficiency. In June 2021, the company invested $680 million in expanding its manufacturing capacity by building a new facility in Ohio. It stated that the new facility would \u201cproduce a higher degree of automation, precision, and continuous improvement\u201d by combining worker power with AI and IOT connectivity.\n\nFirst Solar also offers investors AI exposure through partnerships. It has teamed up with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to help the tech giant achieve its goal of becoming carbon neutral. Microsoft has made it clear that this will be achieved by further harnessing the growing power of AI and data science. First Solar has been making ample use of Microsoft\u2019s technologies for some time, demonstrating the importance of AI for the manufacturing and clean energy markets.\n\nHyundai Motors (HYMTF) Hyundai (HYMTF) sign for car dealership with blue sky in background, symbolizing HYMTF stock\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/AntonovVitalii\n\nThis South Korean automaker doesn\u2019t get as much attention as other car names. But to overlook Hyundai (OTCMKTS:HYMTF) would be to make a critical mistake.\n\nIn June 2021, it completed the acquisition of Boston Dynamics, a company with years of progress demonstrating the power of robotic technology. One year later, it announced plans to launch the Boston Dynamics AI Institute, a project geared toward advancing AI and robotics. The company has already demonstrated progress on this front, sharing a video on its website of a robot helping potential buyers shop for cars.\n\nHyundai\u2019s AI advancements don\u2019t stop there. It is also highly focused on autonomous driving. As part of this, it announced that its IONIQ 5 robo-taxi would be hitting the streets in 2023. One of its South Korea-based affiliates has partnered with leading chipmaker Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) to further its autonomous driving tech. If this progress continues, Hyundai is likely to pose a threat to the other automakers who want to win the driverless race.\n\nInnodata (INOD) Binary code data\n\nSource: carlos castilla/Shutterstock\n\nYou might not know the name Innodata (NASDAQ:INOD), but if you\u2019re seeking cheap AI stocks to buy before they explode, you absolutely should.\n\nThis company has surged more than 200% over the past six months and it still trades at less than $11 per share. Innodata operates in the business process solution space, helping companies solve complex data and engineering challenges through AI. And while it isn\u2019t a household name yet, the company\u2019s growth speaks for itself. InvestorPlace contributor Ian Cooper notes that for all the explosive growth it has seen recently, INOD stock has plenty of room to run as the AI boom powers it higher. In his words:\n\n\u201c[The company] was selected by a leading cloud infrastructure and platform services company to provide large-scale data collection for a new AI computer vision initiative. Innodata also just signed a significant application re-engineering agreement to enable a customer to more fully leverage Innodata-built artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) models.\u201d\n\nCooper also notes that Innodata could stand to benefit from the increasing trend of tech giants acquiring smaller AI firms. In either case, the company is a likely winner among lesser-known AI innovators.\n\nLuminar Technologies (LAZR) Luminar (LAZR stock) sign with greenery around it\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto/shutterstock.com\n\nAutomakers are focused on winning the driverless race\u2026 and Luminar (NASDAQ:LAZR) is helping several industry leaders get there.\n\nThis innovative startup produces lidar technology designed to make autonomous driving safer for everyone. It does this by helping vehicles detect their surroundings by sending out distance-measuring laser beams. And while Elon Musk has criticized this type of technology, he may live to eat his words. Other experts have praised Luminar\u2019s innovations and speculated that its tech could help other automakers finish ahead of Tesla.\n\nThere\u2019s good reason for this optimism. Luminar remains highly focused on growth through partnerships. In June 2023, it announced an agreement to bring its AI-based driving software to automated trucking company Plus. Before that, it collaborated with autonomous driving leader Pony.ai on a new sensing platform. Automakers clearly trust Luminar\u2019s technology to help them make driverless cars safe.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Image of corporate building with Microsoft logo above the entrance.\n\nSource: NYCStock / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs one of the tech sector\u2019s leading companies, it makes sense that Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) would be helping lead the charge toward an AI-driven future. This Silicon Valley behemoth has plenty going for it, none the least of which is its multibillion-dollar investment in ChatGPT maker OpenAI. That alone would be enough to earn MSFT a place on a list of the top AI stocks to buy. But the company has plenty of other projects that make it worth betting on for investors seeking AI exposure. Its cloud computing platform Microsoft Azure includes many important features such as tools for users to create their own AI solutions.\n\nLike its Big Tech peers, Microsoft has the resources to continue scaling its operations. It offers users the opportunity to do almost any business-related task that involves AI, from developing conversational AI bots to complex machine learning models. As the company continues incorporating advanced AI tools into its vast array of products, MSFT stock will only continue growing. Shares are up 50% over the past six months and they aren\u2019t about to slow down as the AI boom picks up steam.\n\nAI Stocks to Buy: MicroStrategy (MSTR) A chart of the MicroStrategy logo with a Bitcoin\n\nSource: JOCA_PH / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhen this company makes headlines, it\u2019s often for crypto-related matters. After all, the business intelligence consultancy currently owns $4.6 billion in Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and its co-founder Michael Saylor is a leading Bitcoin evangelist.\n\nBut MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) has been on a truly impressive winning streak recently, rising more than 200% over the past two quarters. The recent crypto rally has certainly helped, but it isn\u2019t the only reason.\n\nKnown for producing enterprise analytics software, this company has also been busy incorporating AI-based tools into its tech. Its Data Whisperer program features a chatbot that helps users understand their data. It also uses AI models to bring new insights to customers by evaluating data to spot new trends and outlying factors. Meanwhile, the company has been exploring partnerships with industry leaders. As InvestorPlace contributor Tyrik Torres notes:\n\n\u201cRecently, MicroStrategy announced a multi-year partnership with Microsoft to integrate MicroStrategy\u2019s analytics into Microsoft\u2019s Azure OpenAI service. This makes it one of those AI stocks with triple digit returns potentially in the future.\u201d\n\nMobileye Global (MBLY) Transdev Mobileye (MBLY) autonomous driving shuttle bus showcased at the IAA Mobility 2021 motor show in Munich, Germany\n\nSource: VanderWolf Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nLike Luminar, Mobileye (NASDAQ:MBLY) is helping power the autonomous driving revolution.\n\nThe company produces advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), which it claims have been deployed in more than 135 million vehicles. Pus, Mobileye produces both software and hardware systems, including chips and censors. This puts it in an excellent position to help automakers continue advancing toward a driverless future. In 2022, it began testing its tech in self-driving cars in both the U.S. and Germany in order to train its AI to handle a wider variety of road conditions.\n\nInvestorPlace contributor Tom Taulli sees MBLY as a potential winner among AI stocks to buy. He notes that while the company\u2019s last earnings report did not thrill Wall Street, investors should regard it as an opportunity to pick up a valuable AI stock at a better valuation before it gains momentum. Taulli also adds that Mobileye comes with key advantages, such as a \u201cpatent portfolio, proprietary algorithms and rich data repositories.\u201d All these factors could help MBLY keep rising as demand for autonomous driving solutions continues to grow.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia corporation (NVDA) logo displayed on smartphone with stock market chart background. Nvidia is a global leader in artificial intelligence hardware and software\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nSince 2022, it\u2019s been impossible to discuss AI stocks without the conversation turning to Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). To say that this chipmaker has been the breakout stock of the year would be an understatement. It reached a trillion-dollar market cap during the AI boom and it seems as though the Silicon Valley darling is there to stay. It has soared over 150% over the past six months and while this may not seem sustainable, the company is showing no signs of slowing down. Many companies depend on Nvidia\u2019s products to continue their AI efforts. This includes ChatGPT, which is said to be powered by Nvidia chips.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t take much to see that this puts Nvidia in a position of power as the AI revolution rages on. In fact, it may be the most likely winner of the new AI-driven economy. Between the AI and metaverse, more and more companies will come to rely on Nvidia\u2019s products, sending demand sky high. Simply having ChatGPT as a client would make it a clear choice among AI stocks to buy.\n\nBut as InvestorPlace\u2019s Louis Navellier notes, Nvidia\u2019s potential far exceeds the chatbot. The economy is moving in a new direction, creating a wave that NVDA stock is perfectly tailored to ride.\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) A close-up shot of a hand on a screen with the Palantir (PLTR) logo.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe rise of machine learning is an excellent development for Big Data analytics. This means that firms in the space will be working overtime to implement AI into their day-to-day operations. Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) is up more than 170% year to date as the firm that helps other companies embrace Big Data.\n\nThe Financial Times recently described the rise of AI as the crisis that Palantir has been looking for. Palantir recently demonstrated its new AI platform\u2019s military applications, and company insiders have claimed to be seeing \u201cunprecedented demand\u201d for it. Palantir also recently announced a partnership with autonomous drone technology producer AirMatrix, furthering its AI exposure even more.\n\nRockwell Automation (ROK) Rockwell Automation sign is seen in Cambridge, On, Canada. ROK stock.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock\n\nLango has described the AI boom as a \u201cMt. Everest-sized opportunity in AI robotics.\u201d This means that established leaders in the space will have significant room to run as more companies prioritize automation. Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK) is exactly such a company. It focuses primarily on creating industrial automation and control systems, but its products and services are vast, spanning as far as cybersecurity and network solutions.\n\nRockwell hasn\u2019t seen the type of gains that some companies on this list have this year. Investors should be careful to see the big picture, though. ROK stock has been gradually gaining momentum as the AI boom has taken off, demonstrating slow-but-steady growth. The company boasts robust financials and a truly global reach that will only expand more as demand for its products continues. As a trusted leader in the automation space, Rockwell will have a clear advantage in the coming year.\n\nAI Stocks to Buy: SoundHound AI (SOUN) SOUN stock: SoundHound's Headquarters exterior featuring a sign with the company's logo in the foreground and a parking lot and building in the background.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock\n\nThis stock likely isn\u2019t on the radar of too many investors. But SoundHound AI (NASDAQ:SOUN) is worthy of investor attention.\n\nThe company has already proven that its audio and speech recognition technology has major applications for industries such as food service and automotive, as well as for contact centers. Its conversational AI tools can help businesses with tasks such as answering phones and taking messages and reservations. As workers opt away from these jobs, more and more small businesses will be seeking automated solutions. If you need help answering the phone, SoundHound might have exactly what you need.\n\nDespite still trading below $5, SOUN stock has made impressive progress this year, rising 175% YTD. Cooper has also flagged it as a likely acquisition target, and with demand growing for its tech, it\u2019s easy to see why. Additionally, SoundHound also saw a significant boost recently after being added to the Russell 2000 and Russell 3000 indices. This will help the company gain legitimacy in the eyes of the financial community and will likely spur further investment.\n\nSplunk (SPLK) Splunk (SPLK) logo on the company office in Santana Row.\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nFor a leader in the workplace AI space, Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) hasn\u2019t risen by as much as some of its peers. However, that just means investors have an opportunity to pick up a valuable stock at a discount.\n\nThis company also helps clients analyze and sort through their data. If Palantir is benefitting from the new data boom, Splunk could very well follow. It also features a generative AI tool used to enhance user experiences. This interface also allows the user to create Splunk Processing Language (SPL) queries. All this is meant to make Splunk\u2019s valuable features more accessible to users.\n\nOn top of all that, the company recently reported fiscal Q1 2024 earnings and they did not disappoint. Splunk surpassed analyst estimates, reporting an 11% increase in revenue while annual recurring revenue rose by 16%. Even more impressive is its positive free cash flow, which saw a year-over-year (YOY) increase of 253%. When we consider all that, it\u2019s not hard to see why Wall Street analysts remain highly bullish on SPLK stock.\n\nStem (STEM) Conceptual image of a modern battery energy storage system with wind turbines and solar panel power plants in background\n\nSource: petrmalinak / Shutterstock\n\nAnother company that often gets overshadowed by its larger peers, Stem (NYSE:STEM) offers investors exposure to both the AI and clean energy markets.\n\nThis perch at the intersection of these two growing sectors, combined with its low price point of less than $10, should make it an enticing play for investors who don\u2019t mind a little risk. STEM stock has been on a winning streak this month, rising more than 26% and making it clear it doesn\u2019t intend to slow down. Part of this is likely due to AI driven momentum. Stem\u2019s Athena platform uses this new tech to maximize \u201cenergy asset performance and investments,\u201d providing a valuable service. As I previously reported\u00a0:\n\n\u201cThe rising costs of electricity are creating a highly favorable economic landscape for Stem. As more and more companies invest in clean energy solutions, programs like Athena will become necessary for management and efficiency purposes. Stem\u2019s revenue has been rising steadily this year, but the company is poised to soar in the coming years as it plays a critical role in both the green and AI revolutions.\u201d\n\nSymbotic (SYM) Illustration of robot hand reaching for the letters \"AI\" with tech symbols around it. AI tech stock predictions\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Allies Interactive\n\nBased in Wilmington, Massachusetts, this warehouse automation innovator is also riding the robotics boom that Lango discussed. Symbotic (NASDAQ:SYM) has surged by an astonishing 275% YTD, proving just how powerful the demand for warehouse automation is. It produces both robots driven by AI and an automation platform for warehouses. It has partnered with\u00a0retail powerhouses such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Albertsons (NYSE:ACI). Other companies are likely to follow as demand for robotic solutions in warehouse and shipping facilities increases. This technology can allow companies to decrease their operating costs and increase shipping efficiency, making it a worthwhile investment.\n\n\u201cSymbotic is also poised to benefit from higher spending by consumers on physical products, a phenomenon that I expect to begin occurring in earnest during the current quarter,\u201d notes InvestorPlace contributor Larry Ramer.\n\nThat\u2019s just one of the reasons that Ramer considers SYM stock to be one of the best ways to gain AI exposure.\n\nTeradyne (TER) Teradyne Silicon Valley office\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the world\u2019s largest robotic technology producers, Teradyne (NASDAQ:TER) designs and manufactures automatic test equipment but it also produces collaborative robots, designed to work alongside humans. The company has taken significant steps to expand its AI operations, acquiring both Universal Robots and Mobile Industrial Robots. These deals give it a sizable share of an already booming market that is likely to only increase as industry trends spur demand for the type of robotic solutions that Teradyne provides.\n\nTeradyne\u2019s power lies in the fact that it both manufactures top-of-the-line equipment and creates robots designed to help automate away mundane tasks. Those are two areas in which demand isn\u2019t fading, allowing it a clear pathway to growth. It has also partnered with companies in the automotive, defense and aerospace sectors, giving investors even more reason to bet on it. For these reasons, InvestorPlace contributor Faizan Farooque believes it has the potential to deliver \u201clife-changing returns.\u201d\n\nAI Stocks to Buy: Wearable Devices (WLDS) Man in suit wearing tech watch representing Wearable Devices (WLDS) stock\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/LDprod\n\nThis may seem like an unconventional choice for a list of the best AI stocks to buy. But pay attention.\n\nWearable Devices (NASDAQ:WLDS) is developing an AI-based \u201cwearable neural interface\u201d that could take it out of penny stock territory. Wearable Devices wants to put this device in the form of a wristband that can control technology with \u201csubtle finger movements.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, the company received a $900,00 grant from the Israel Innovation Authority (IIA) to develop the neural interface, sending shares soaring. It has had an overall outstanding year, rising 215% YTD and still trading at less than $2 per share.\n\nIf investors don\u2019t mind some risk, WLDS could prove a highly profitable investment if it can get its flagship device to market. Its technology could prove to be the next big thing in AI, assuming it can keep developing it successfully.\n\nOn Penny Stocks and Low-Volume Stocks: With only the rarest exceptions, InvestorPlace does not publish commentary about companies that have a market cap of less than $100 million or trade less than 100,000 shares each day.

My name is Martin Viecha, VP of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn and a number of other executives. \r\nOur Q2 results were announced at about 3 p.m. Central Time, and the update deck, we published at the same link as this webcast. \r\nDuring this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC. (Operator Instructions) \r\nBut before we jump into the Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nThank you, Martin. So just a Q2 recap. In Q2, we achieved record vehicle production and deliveries and record revenue of about $25 billion in a single quarter. And Model Y became the best-selling vehicle of any kind globally in Q1, surpassing the likes of Corolla and Golf. So it was the #1 vehicle of any kind, including vehicles that are sold at a far lower price. This was, I think, an incredible achievement by the Tesla team, and just a huge thank you to our customers for their support. \r\nAnd this came in spite of high interest rates and a lot of macro uncertainty. And nonetheless, we managed to achieve operating margin of about 10%. We continue to target 1.8 million vehicle deliveries this year, although we expect that Q3 production will be a little bit down because we've got summer shutdowns for a lot of factory upgrades, so just probably a slight decrease in production in Q3 for sort of global factory upgrades. \r\nAnd the long-term economy we think is going to just drive volume through the ceiling, next level. And our sort of future robotaxi products, the dedicated robotaxi products, we think have a quasi-infinite demand. The way we're going to manufacture the robotaxi is also itself a revolution. And so it's a revolutionary sign made in a revolutionary way. It will be, by far, the highest units per hour of any vehicle production ever. And I'm so very excited about that. \r\nWith respect to Autopilot and Dojo, in order to build autonomy, we also need to train our neural net with data from millions of vehicles. The more -- I mean, this has been proven over and over again, the more training data you have, the better the results. And I mean, there are times where we see basically, in a neural net basically, it's sort of, at a million training examples, it barely works at 2 million, it slightly works at 3 million. It's like, \"Wow, okay, we're seeing something.\" But then you get to like 10 million training examples, it's like -- it becomes incredible. So there's just no substitute for a massive amount of data. And obviously, Tesla has more vehicles on the road that are collecting this data than all other companies combined by, I think, maybe even an order of magnitude. So I think we might have 90% of all -- a very big number. \r\nSo the success in AI and dev is a function of talent, sort of unique data and computing resources. And we have outstanding capabilities in all 3 arenas. And I really just don't know how anyone could do what we're doing, even if they had our software and had our computer, if they did not have the training data. \r\nSo speaking of which, our Dojo training computer is designed to significantly reduce the cost of neural net training. It is designed to -- it's somewhat optimized for the kind of training that we need, which is a video training. So we just see that the need for neural net training, again, talking of being a quasi-infinite of things, is just enormous. So I think having -- we expect to use both NVIDIA and Dojo, to be clear. But there's -- we just see a demand for really advanced training resources. And we think we may reach in-house neural net training capability of 100 [exoblocks] by the end of next year. \r\nSo today, over 300 million miles have been driven using FSD Beta. That 300 million-mile number is going to seem small very quickly. It will soon be billions of miles, tens of billions of miles. And the FSD will go from being as good as a human to then being vastly better than a human. We see a clear path to full self-driving being 10x safer than the average human driver. And between Autopilot and Dojo computer, our inference hardware in the car, which we call sort of hardware 3, 4. But it's really dedicated. It's a high-efficiency inference computer that's in the car. And our Optimus robot, Tesla's really at the cutting edge of AI development. \r\nWith regard to our Cybertruck, we continue to build release candidates of the Cybertruck on our final production line in Austin. I'm actually here in Austin at the Gigafactory. This is the first truck that we're aware of that will have 4 doors over a 6-foot bed and will fit into a 20-foot garage. So it's the biggest on the outside, but it's even bigger on the inside. So I think that's -- one of the elements of good design is it should feel bigger on the inside than it looks on the outside. And this is no small car, but we really cared about the exterior dimensions of the Cybertruck down to the last millimeter. So just trying to get right in the middle of the Goldilocks zone, not too big, not too small, and then really maximize the utility of the volume. And we can't wait to start delivering it later this year. \r\nSome other highlights. Our global Supercharging network now stands at over roughly 50,000 connectors and over 5,000 locations. As I think a lot of people are aware, the Tesla charging standard, which we made open source, and it's now called the North American Charging Standard, we're deeply honored that Ford, GM, Mercedes and many other OEMs have signed up to use our connector and gain access to our charging network. We strongly believe in helping other car companies to accelerate the EV revolution and just trying to do the right thing, in general. So that's our goal there. \r\nThen I think what I want to emphasize, like very strongly, this is a very important point, is that Tesla, just as with the North American Charging Standard, although we're not licensing -- in that case not licensing, we're just making it available. But we are very open to licensing our full self-driving software and hardware to other car companies. And we are already in discussions with -- only just early discussions with a major OEM about using Tesla FSD. So we're not trying to keep this to ourselves. We're more than happy to license it to others. And lastly, our new lithium refinery and cathode facility are progressing well. \r\nNow in conclusion, we continue to focus on making as many cars as we can while maintaining healthy financials. Our artificial intelligence development is obviously entering a new era, and we're incredibly excited about what's to come. Our other businesses such as Megapack, supercharging service and whatnot, all started to become a meaningful contributor to overall profitability this quarter. \r\nAnd then lastly, I'd just like to profusely thank all of our employees who are making a lot of extra effort during uncertain times. Thank you very much for your hard work and the impact you're making.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nThank you very much, Elon. And I think Zach has some opening remarks as well.\n\nZachary John Planell Kirkhorn\n\nYes. Thanks, Martin. As Elon mentioned, Q2 was another record quarter of production and deliveries as well as records in profit for energy and services and other businesses. Congratulations again to the Tesla team on the continued progress. \r\nAs we navigate through a period of economic uncertainty, rising interest rates, volatility and consumer confidence and regulatory change, I want to comment on our financial approach. \r\nFirst, the single most important priority is to ensure we are continuing to invest heavily in the core technologies that will drive the long-term value of the business. These include increasing spending on AI-related technologies such as full self-driving, Optimus and Dojo; as well as new products such as Cybertruck, our next-generation platform, and the Semi, as evidenced by the continued growth in our R&D spend. This also includes continuing our investments in capacity expansion not only in our vehicle factories but also our supercharging network service, internal applications and battery processes as we continue with meaningful capital expenditures to lay this foundation for the future. \r\nSecond, we continue to work towards our goals of maximizing volumes on both our vehicle and energy business but, most importantly, doing so in a way that generates the capital to continue our pace of R&D and capital investments. This requires a strong focus on per unit COGS reductions in each of our key businesses as well as working capital improvements on raw materials, work-in-process inventory and customer AR, all of which progressed appropriately in Q2. \r\nIf we look specifically at our automotive business, our gross margin showed a modest reduction and remained healthy, despite action taken to further improve vehicle affordability early in the quarter. We recognized -- we realized per unit cost improvements in nearly every category, including material cost and commodities, manufacturing costs and logistics, while also continuing to rapidly increase the build rate in our Austin and Berlin factories. For our Energy business, we improved margins and gross profit driven by cost reductions in deal economics, particularly with Megapack. As a reminder, storage volumes are typically volatile sequentially based on the types of projects and their specific revenue recognition milestones. \r\nAs we look forward to the rest of the year, I want to reiterate Elon's comments on Q3 volumes driven by planned downtimes for factory upgrades. These upgrades will also carry some amount of factory idle cost. However, we are working to minimize as much as possible. It's also important to keep in mind the uncertainty in the macro environment, which can impact our execution positively or negatively in the near term. Regardless, we continue to remain dynamic with a focus on fundamental efficiency and a long-term outlook. \r\nCongratulations again to everybody on a great quarter.\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nZachary John Planell Kirkhorn\n\nThank you very much, Zach. And let's go to investor questions. The first question on licensing FSD, we've already answered. So let's go to the second one. The second question is, what is the status of 4680 cells? How far are you from the specs you laid out on Battery Day? When do you expect to achieve what you laid out on Battery Day?\n\nUnidentified Company Representative\n\nYes. First, I'll just start with a little bit of a production update. So in Texas, 4680 cell production increased 80% Q2 over Q1, and the team surpassed 10 million production cells produced here in Texas. So congrats to the team for that. Their focus on yield reduced our scrap bill by 40% quarter-over-quarter, and that resulted in a 25% reduction in cell COGS. \r\nHere in Texas, we're preparing to launch our Cybertruck cell, which is 10% higher energy density than current production. That was accomplished through process and mechanical design optimization. As we scale Cyber cell production through the end of the year and early next, we should be in a comfortable place on cost per cell. Against our battery energy density targets, the Cyber cell is at our expectations on a like-for-like electrochemistry basis. We're yet to integrate silicon or in-house cathode production, both reviewed on Battery Day, which do bring significant further energy density and cost improvements, but that is a topic for another day. \r\nLastly, it is important to remember that most of what we focused on at Battery Day was the Tesla-engineered 4680 production system and the improvements we strove to achieve on equipment, factory density, capital cost and utility cost reduction, all of which we are realizing in our Texas scale-up to date.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nThank you very much. The next question is, can you talk more to the upcoming Tesla Energy products and how your thinking has evolved on the revenue model? Given Tesla's AI capabilities, how do you see the long-term mix between hardware margin and recurring software margin from Autobidder as this segment accelerates?\n\nUnidentified Company Representative\n\nWe can't comment on future product road map, but I can provide a quick energy Q2 update. Megapack continues to show strong demand globally, with Lathrop ramping successfully to meet our contracted projects in 2023. As stated last quarter, Megapack margins are in a reasonable place, in line with our target market -- vehicle target margins. \r\nThe second final assembly line at Lathrop is progressing on schedule, eventually doubling Lathrop capacity ahead of our full factory ramp in 2024. We have several exciting large projects in construction or nearing completion, including the KES project in Hawaii, the Riverina project in Australia, several projects in California and one here at Gigafactory, Texas that we'll tour today, actually. We want to thank our customers, utilities and grid operators for trusting us with these projects. \r\nOn the Autobidder question, we continue to grow Autobidder contracts in wholesale markets like Australia, Texas, U.K. and California with over 6 gigawatt hours under Tesla's dispatch next year. In the U.K., our projects performed best in the industry in Q2. Autobidder does have software margins and is an enabler for hardware sales, but it's a relatively small contributor to revenues given how much deployment growth on the Megapack hardware side is occurring. It's important to remember that this large project -- these large capital projects that have lifetimes of 20 years of recurring revenues on an annualized basis relative to upfront CapEx are small. \r\nOn the residential side, we have some fun things happening. We recently surpassed 0.5 million Powerwalls installed. Just this week, we are launching Charge on Solar, which allows Tesla Powerwall and vehicle customers to charge their vehicles using their excess solar and drive only on the sunshine that hits their roof. Yesterday, we began paying customers in Texas for participating in our virtual power plant to provide grid support to ERCOT. We expect these credits to lower our median customer's annual bill by 1/3 and to increase these credits over time as ERCOT expands market access. \r\nAnd today, we are expanding Tesla electric enrollment to new Model 3 owners in Texas, followed by all Texas vehicle customers over the rest of the quarter. Unfortunately, and somewhat similar to Tesla Insurance, bringing Tesla electric and VPP capabilities to our customers requires working through a fractured regulatory environment on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis. In the long run, the value of residential energy software and hardware will be driven by the level of market access that utilities, market operators and regulators permit. For Powerwalls eligible to provide the full stack of energy services, like peaker capacity and system buffering, such as in Australia, we can more than double the value of ownership relative to a typical system today.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nThank you very much. The next question is, could you quantify the benefits to COGS per unit from the IRA battery manufacturing incentives; and secondly, battery raw material declines year-to-date?\n\nZachary John Planell Kirkhorn\n\nAll right. I can take that. On the first part of the question for IRA manufacturing incentives, we provided previous guidance that we expect these to be, for the course of this year, in the range of $150 million to $250 million per quarter. We are staying within that foundry as we guided previously, so that was the case in Q2 as well. I will note, and I think we've mentioned this before, that this includes a 50-50 sharing of credits for qualified cells from our long-term battery partner, Panasonic. \r\nOn the commodity side, we are continuing to see improvements there, as we've discussed previously. Lithium is the most notable improvement so far. I think I commented on this on the last call because typically, we see this coming about a quarter before. It actually is realized in our financials. And also just as a reminder, we're not fully exposed to the price of lithium. Our supply chain team has done a terrific job in partnership with another -- a bunch of other companies to put in place some long-term agreements here, but we do have some exposure that moves up and down. We're also seeing benefits in aluminum and steel, which I think is great. Not as large as the lithium impacts, but they contribute nonetheless. So if we add up the total impact of this in Q2 relative to prior quarter, it's about the same size and magnitude as the IRA benefits that we also received. \r\nJust to put this in context, as you look at COGS per unit sequentially from Q1 to Q2, I think there's 2 things to keep in mind there. The first is that our S/X mix for deliveries increased quite a bit from Q1 to Q2. So as you think about fundamental cost reductions, it's important to adjust for that. And then secondly, as we continue to work on reducing our Austin and Berlin cost, which we did quite a bit of that from Q1 to Q2, these factories are still slightly above Model Y production costs elsewhere. And in the quarter, our mix of Austin- and Berlin-related builds increased. And so that's something to consider as you model out the impact from Q1 to Q2 in terms of COGS per unit. \r\nI do want to ask Karn if there's anything else on the commodity side or just more generally, you want to add here?\n\nKarn Budhiraj\n\nYes. As you mentioned, Zach, we've naturally been a little bit hedged from the lithium position because of the long-term contracts we have in place. But we have seen reduction in pricing across the board for all commodities that specifically go into batteries such as nickel, cobalt and graphite. And the reductions in pricing translate into thousands of dollars when you look at it from a per-vehicle impact. We're taking advantage of the historically low commodity pricing in certain areas to kind of expand some of those fixed price contracts through the end of the decade. So it's a playbook that we'll continue to kind of go back to as we look to the future.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nThank you. The next question on FSD, have you considered allowing FSD transferability as a lever to allow existing customers to upgrade to a new Tesla instead of being locked into an existing car due to the price of FSD?\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nYes, this is a question we get asked a lot. So we're excited to announce that for Q3, we will be allowing transfer of FSD. This is a onetime amnesty. So it needs to be -- you need to take advantage of it in Q3, but -- or at least place the order in Q3 within reasonable delivery time frames. So yes, I hope this makes people happy. And we're not going to repeat. This is a onetime thing.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nAll right. The next question, when will we give more information about the Cybertruck orders, estimated delivery schedules, pricing and specifications?\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nDemand is so far off the hook you can't even see the hook. So that's really not an issue. I do want to emphasize that the Cybertruck has a lot of new technology in it, like a lot. It doesn't look like any other vehicle because it is not like any other vehicle. And the production ramp will move as fast as the slowest and least lucky elements of the entire supply chain and internal production. So I wouldn't expect -- I hope it's smooth. We're certainly better at production ramps than -- we've got a lot of experience with the production ramps. \r\nBut first order approximation is there's like 10,000 unique parts and processes in the Cybertruck. And if any one of -- it will go as fast as the least lucky, least well-executed, elements of the 10,000. So it's always difficult to predict the ramp initially, but I think we'll be making them in high volume next year, and we will be delivering the car this year.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nThank you. The next question is critics of Gigacasting contended that process makes vehicles harder and more costly to repair, essentially pushing costs on to the customer. Can you share some details about the initial repair experience with Gigacast vehicles?\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nThat must be why everyone's copying us.\n\nLars Moravy\n\nThanks, Elon. This is Lars. Martin, that's like simply not true. There's a misconception that traditional bodies are easy to repair, but they are made up of multiple materials and multiple joining methods. Spot welds and rivets have to be drilled out. Panels and structural adhesives have to be chiseled down. Dried adhesive has to be removed; stains and cut, blah, blah, blah.\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nIt's a crazy patchwork quilt.\n\nLars Moravy\n\nYes. And so putting that back together means time and money. Using an example of replacing a rear cast rail in the Model Y, to do that versus like what we replaced it with in Model 3, it's 10x cheaper and 3x faster to do it with the cast rail. My design team works with our collision repair team since we're closed loop on this with Insurance, and we designed specific parts that will make it easier and faster to repair. And we have an incentive to do that because we have our own insurance and our own body shops. We expect that we'll continue to do this, and collision repair will continue to become cheaper and faster over time. And we already make this available to all body shops, to our Tesla-approved body shop training.\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nYes, closing loop on collision repair and factoring that into design is a big deal.\n\nLars Moravy\n\nIt's crucial. I don't think anyone else can do it with that ecosystem that we have.\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nYes. And we are actually able to change the details of the casting with inserts, and we actually do that all the time, because the inserts actually wear out and need to be replaced anyway. So we can actually make design changes to the inserts and tweak the castings. Basically, the cast rear body or front body is lighter, cheaper, better noise vibration or harshness, much easier to manufacture.\n\nLars Moravy\n\nIt's better in every way.\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nAnd that's why so many other car companies are copying us.\n\nLars Moravy\n\nProbably.\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nWell, they certainly put out a lot of press releases about it. I think it's basically going to be how all cars are made in the future.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nThank you. Next question, how many Optimus bots have been made? And when will they be able to start performing useful tasks?\n\nElon R. Musk\n\n10 million. Yes, I think we're around 5 or 6 bots. I think there's a -- we were at 10, I guess. It depends on how many are working and what phase. But it's sort of -- yes, there's more every month. There are a lot of interesting things about the Optimus bot. We found that there are actually no suppliers that can produce the actuators. There are no off-the-shelf actuators that work well for a humanoid robot at any price.\n\nUnidentified Company Representative\n\nIt's certainly not compelling a humanoid robot...\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nYes, not a humanoid robot that can do something -- the things that a human could do. So we've actually had to design our own actuators to integrate the motor, the power electronics, the controller, the sensors. And really, every one of them is custom designed. And then, of course, we'll be using the same inference hardware as the car. But we, in designing these actuators, are designing them for volume production, so that they're not just lighter, tighter and more capable than any other actuators whereof that exists in the world. But it's also actually manufacturable. So we should be able to make them in volume. The first Optimus that is will have all of the Tesla designed actuators, sort of production candidate actuators, integrated and walking should be around November-ish. And then we'll start ramping up after that. \r\nIn terms of when we'll be able to do some useful things, like we'll first be trying this out in our own factories and just proving out its utility, but I think we'll be able to have it do something useful in our factories sometime next year. I would be -- yes, I'm pretty confident of that. So yes, it's going well. \r\nI should say another cool thing about Optimus is that there's -- just in the U.S. alone, there are 2 million amputees. And I was just talking to the Neuralink team, and by combining a Neuralink implant and a robotic arm or leg for someone that has had their arm or leg, or arms and legs, amputated, we believe we can give basically a cyborg body that is incredibly capable. $6 million man in real life. But it won't cost $6 million -- a $60,000 man. So it sounds impressive, but it will actually -- so that actually could be a really -- I think it would be incredible to potentially help malaise people around the world. And to give them a robot arm like that is as good, maybe long term better, than a biological one.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nThank you. The next question is, how has the order intake trended relatively to production levels during Q2? And how has it trended in the quarter-to-date period? Conceptually, how does Tesla decide when is it appropriate to reduce prices or add other sales incentives to increase demand?\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nYes. I guess demand has roughly tracked production, which is what we aim for, is we look at -- something that we have that really, I think, no other carmaker has is that we have real-time demand and real-time production. Like, so 7 days a week, I get an e-mail -- order-generated e-mail which shows output from all factories and orders globally. So it's like a real-time finger on the pulse of earth basically. And we adjust course according to what the mood of the public is. Buying a new car is a big decision for a vast majority of people. So any time there's economic uncertainty, people generally pause on new car buying at least to see what happens. \r\nAnd then obviously, another challenge is the interest rate environment. As interest rates rise, the affordability of anything bought with debt decreases, so effectively increasing the price of the car. So when interest rates rise dramatically, we actually have to reduce the price of the car because the interest payments increased the price of the car. And this is -- at least up until recently, it was, I believe, the sharpest interest rate rise in history. So we had to do something about that. And it's not that I got a crystal ball for the global economy. I really appreciate if I could borrow that crystal ball.\n\nUnidentified Company Representative\n\nDM us.\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nYes, exactly, DM me. It should be not on Twitter. So I mean, one day, it seems like the world economy is falling apart. And the next day, everything is fine. I don't know what the hell was going on, to be totally frank. I wish I did. So I mean that's why I say like -- I was on Twitter. I posted, like just really advising -- because I care a lot about the sort of small shareholders, especially ones that have stuck with us through thick and thin. I love you, guys. And so we can't control these macro shocks or the thematic depressive nature of the stock market. So that's why I recommend against margin loans in times that are turbulent. \r\nIf times are not that turbulent, actually a margin loan can be a smart move, within reason. But we're in, I would call it, turbulent times. Like, I have very high confidence in the long-term value of Tesla. Like, I see it -- I really see a path to a 10x or maybe -- call it a 5x increase in the value of the company, maybe a 10x. But where things go along the way, the trials and tribulations and the mood of the markets, one cannot predict. And so the old adage of buy and hold is right. \r\nFor an investment advice, I'd say like identify a company whose products you love. See if they -- does it seem like they'll continue to make good products or great products? Buy that stock and hold it. That's it. You all win. The reason companies exist is to make goods and services, ideally great goods and services. They don't exist for any other reason. They shouldn't. So that's why you should buy stock of a company that makes great products and has a great future pipeline. It's common sense, actually. \r\nAnd then generally, if you see, if you -- provided you're confident about what that company's products or services are, when the market panics, buy. And when the market is overly exuberant, you can sell. I'm not recommending you sell, but buy low, sell high. \r\nWarren Buffett, actually, I think has a saying -- I'm paraphrasing him, but a publicly traded company is like -- imagine you're living in your house and some crazy, manic-depressive guy comes and stands outside your house and yells property prices at you, and it's a different price every day, but the house is still the same house. So this is a tough market. Credit that to Warren Buffett.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nThank you. Let's go to the next question. With the emphasis of price cuts to drive volume growth eating into automotive gross margin, can investors expect to see automotive gross margin stabilize or even rise due to efficiencies outpacing the cuts? And if so, when?\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nOh, man. Where's that crystal ball again? If I may, look, the short-term variances in gross margin and profitability really are minor relative to the long-term picture. Autonomy, we'll make all of these numbers look silly. I'd recommend looking at ARK Invest. I think their analysis is very good. It's the best I -- and generally, Fintwit or like other finance -- there's a Smart Finance we follow on Twitter, follow their accounts. They're great. So that's, in my opinion, where you'll get the best info. \r\nSo I strongly believe Tesla is a big long-term investment. And thus, when things go up and down, in fact, the market panics, buy. If the market is a little too exuberant, sell at the time. But just generally, like, I feel -- I'm confident we'll deliver over the long term but can't control the short term. And the autonomy is really where it's at. I mean, Zach, what do you think?\n\nZachary John Planell Kirkhorn\n\nI fully agree with you. I mean I think the only thing in the short term that matters is what I said in my opening remarks, which is are we generating enough money to continue to invest. And the portfolio of products and technologies that the technical teams are investing in right now, this is intense. It's intense in terms of investment. It's intense in terms of potential.\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nFrankly, I think it's ridiculous that we have positive free cash flow in a capital-intensive business while investing massive amounts of money in new technology. That is super hard.\n\nUnidentified Company Representative\n\nAnd vertical integration. It's not even just like new products but also...\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nYes. We actually make our (expletive), yes, compared to others but -- sorry for cursing, boarding school.\n\nZachary John Planell Kirkhorn\n\nAnd so at least from my perspective, what matters is continuing to generate the cash to invest. That means continuing to be hyper focused on near-term cost reduction, is everything we do in near-term cost reduction provides capital to reinvest? Hyper focused on working capital management, which we've made quite a bit of progress there on the raw materials and with -- as aside of that, we've been very focused on accounts receivables as well to ensure that we can continue to reinvest the cash. This is what we're focused on. \r\nAnd so there's a set of this that we control. We have a pipeline of cost reductions. We are getting tailwinds in the commodity space right now, as Karn mentioned, that's helpful. Variability around average selling prices goes back to Elon's point. We don't control interest rates. We don't control macro consumer sentiment. But we have an obligation to be responsive to that, to ensure that we're matching supply and demand and keeping things balanced. And so this is how we're managing the next handful of quarters. Soon enough, these quarters will be behind us. They won't be a part of the present value of future cash flows of the business. And so we want to make sure we keep that view and make sure that the long term of the business is exactly the way that we want it to be.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nAll right. Thank you very much. And now let's go to analyst questions. The first question comes from Dan Levy from Barclays.\n\nDan Meir Levy\n\nGreat. I wanted to start first with a question about your efforts in AI and Dojo. It's pretty clear, it sounds like you're accelerating your focus. Can you maybe provide us with a sense of what the process is of refining a product? Is it more machines? And maybe you could give us a sense of when the payout starts to -- when you start to see the payout and what the resource outlay is, what should we expect on the OpEx front as a result of this?\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nSorry, are you saying how much are we going to spend on Dojo?\n\nDan Meir Levy\n\nYes.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nOr R&D of Dojo.\n\nDan Meir Levy\n\nYes.\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nWell, we're not going to be open loop on our Dojo expenditures. But I mean, I think we will be spending something north of $1 billion over the next year on -- through the end of next year, it's well over $1 billion in Dojo. And yes, so I mean we've got a truly staggering amount of video data to do training on. And this is another thing. Like, in order to copy us, you also need to spend billions of dollars on training compute. I mean it's like -- and it's also hard to. You need the data, and you need the training computers. It's like -- think, all things needed to actually achieve this at scale toward generalized solution for autonomy, this is one of the hottest problems ever. You see a lot of AI companies doing LLMs and whatnot. And I'd say, if they're so great, why can't they make a self-driving car? Because it's harder. That's why. \r\nBut I do think -- that said, I think there's some great AI companies out there. But just fundamentally, the staggering amount of data we've got to process, it's got to be processed somehow. And custom silicon is the best way to do that. So that's what Dojo is designed to do, is optimize for video training. It's not optimized for LLMs. It's optimized for video training. With video training, you have a much higher ratio of compute-to-memory bandwidth, whereas LLMs tends to be memory bandwidth choked. So that's it. \r\nBut like I said, we're also -- we have some -- we're using a lot of NVIDIA hardware. We'll continue to use -- we'll actually take NVIDIA hardware as fast as NVIDIA will deliver it to us. Tremendous respect for Jensen and NVIDIA. They've done an incredible job. And frankly, I don't know, if they could deliver us enough GPUs, we might not need Dojo. But they can't. They've got so many customers. They've been kind enough to, nonetheless, prioritize some of our GPU orders. But yes, the sheer magnitude of video training -- because like I said, we're not trying to just get as good as human. We want to get to 10x better than human, maybe 100x better than human. Right now, I believe there's something on the order of 1 million automotive deaths per year. And then if you say permanent serious injuries, I think it's probably closer to 10 million per year. And so it matters if you're twice as good as human. Like, 10x better than human would still mean 100,000 deaths and 1 million severe permanent injuries. So it's like, okay, we would rather be 100x better. \r\nSo there's really -- it's a march of knights. And we want to achieve as perfect a safety as possible. And there's truly mind-boggling amounts of video and computer needed for that. And then I do think there's other applications for Dojo, but we just desperately need it for video training.\n\nZachary John Planell Kirkhorn\n\nJust to add to what Elon mentioned, so the numbers that he mentioned are between R&D spend and capital spend. And this is moving quickly. And so we provide a 3-year outlook on our capital expense. We are considering these expenses in that outlook. And as that moves up and down, we'll continue to update our guidance in the Q.\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nYes. I want to say the fundamental rate limiter on the progress of full self-driving is training. If we had more training compute, we would get done faster. So that's it.\n\nZachary John Planell Kirkhorn\n\nAnd it's just difficult to predict how quickly we can execute on it.\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nYes.\n\nDan Meir Levy\n\nGreat. Thank you. Just as a follow-up, I recognize there's sort of incredible macro uncertainty right now, but you're sticking with your near-term volume target of 50% CAGR. As we just think about sort of in the year ahead, Cybertruck, there's going to be some contribution. There's going to be some help from further EV penetration growth. But to what extent are you willing to sacrifice on pricing to keep that 50% volume CAGR intact? Or are you thinking differently about margins versus your prior commentary of willing to sacrifice on margins to get more share?\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nIt's not about getting more share. It's just that you can think of every car that we sell or produce that has full autonomy capability as actually something that, in the future, may be worth as much as 5x what it is today. Because average [pass-through] vehicle is doing like maybe 10 hours of driving a week. If this is sort of -- if this says 1.5 hours a day on average, that's 10 hours a week-ish. If you've got on autonomous -- if that vehicle is able to operate autonomously and use -- so either dedicated autonomous or partially autonomous, like Airbnb, like maybe sometimes you allow your car to be used by others, sometimes you want to use it exclusively just like doing Airbnb with a room in your house, the value is just tremendous. \r\nSo I think sort of it would be -- I think it does make sense to sacrifice margins in favor of making more vehicles because we think, in the not too distant future, they will have a dramatic valuation increase. I think the Tesla fleet value increase at the point in which we can upload full self-driving and is approved by regulators will be the single biggest step change in asset value maybe in history.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nThank you. Let's go to the next analyst. The question comes from Emmanuel Rosner from Deutsche Bank.\n\nEmmanuel Rosner\n\nTwo questions from me as well. First, following up on the autonomy. So before you start launching these dedicated robotaxi vehicles, on existing vehicles, you're improving FSD incrementally. What is your latest targeted timing to essentially release a non-beta version or an eyes-off version that would trigger much higher take rates? And would Tesla benefit from lowering the price of FSD?\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nWell, obviously, as people have sort of made fun of me, and perhaps quite fairly have made fun of me, my predictions about achieving full self-driving have been optimistic in the past. The reason I've been optimistic, what it tends to look like is we'll make rapid progress with a new version of FSD, but then it will curve over logarithmically. So at first, logarithmic curve looks like this sort of fairly straight upward line, diagonal and up. And so if you extrapolate that, then you have a great thing. But then because it's actually logarithmic, it curves over, and then there have been a series of stacked logarithmic curves. \r\nNow I know I'm the boy who cried FSD, but man, I think we'll be better than human by the end of this year. That's not to say we're approved by regulators. And I'm saying then that, that would be in the U.S. because we've got to focus on one market first. But I think we'll be better than human by the end of this year. I've been wrong in the past, I may be wrong this time. And the price of FSD -- so the way to think of the price of FSD is actually very low, it's not high. When you go back to what a singular -- the value of the car increased dramatically if it is actually autonomous. $15,000 is actually a low price, not a high price. And we will offer -- I think we do sort of offer FSD as a sort of monthly subscription. Although, like most people don't know that. So I'd recommend like maybe trying it out as a monthly subscription so you don't have to go with the $15,000 thing. But I think yes, obviously, if the car is worth several times its original price, $15,000 is actually a low price for FSD.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nAnd the next question comes from William Stein from Truist.\n\nWilliam Stein\n\nGreat. I'd like to ask about -- so to stick on this AI topic, we've read with great interest the developments in Dojo today, and you've spoken about FSD. But you've also -- Elon, you started this x.ai company. And for investors that think that there might be quite a bit of value in the AI features and products of Tesla, it might be concerning to see you pursuing another endeavor where AI is the focus. So can you talk about how x.ai might overlap, might perhaps compete, with Tesla or, in other ways, perhaps it enhances the value of what Tesla does?\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nYes, I think it will actually enhance the value of Tesla. There were just some of the world's best AI engineers and scientists that were willing to join a startup, but they were not willing to join a large, sort of relatively established company like Tesla. So I was like -- that's actually how it got started. I was interviewing a few people. And they're like, 'No, we want to do a startup.\" I was like -- and that's all -- I couldn't convince them to join Tesla. So I was like, \"Okay, well, better to start up that, that I run this, than they go work somewhere else.\" That's kind of the genesis of xAI. And xAI is focused on sort of AGI. Yes. So it's -- like I said, I think there will be some value that xAI brings to Tesla. \r\nAlso, some of the very best people in the world, they really just want to work on interesting problems. So if you take, say, our materials science group, really what convinced Charlie Kuehmann to leave Apple, where he was very happy and well compensated, and both at -- to where we think is the best materials science group in the world, was that he got to work at both Tesla and SpaceX. He wasn't willing to leave Apple if it was just Tesla, but he was willing to do it if it was Tesla and SpaceX. So sometimes you get the best talent in the world, that's the kind of thing you need to do. And that actually has been very beneficial to Tesla.\n\nWilliam Stein\n\nAnd if I could squeeze one more mundane question in, I wonder if you think you can hit the 1.8 million unit number with current pricing or do you anticipate needing to continue to lower prices? Because it seems like they've stabilized, the trends have stabilized, in the last maybe 1.5 months. Should we expect the sort of continued decreases or more stabilization for the rest of the year?\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nSure. We have sort of restarted the referral program, which I think will be quite effective. As Zach was saying earlier, we don't control the macroeconomic conditions. So if interest rates continue to rise, that reduces the affordability of cars. And for a lot of people, they're really kind of just barely breaking even every month. In fact, if you look at the rise in credit card debt, they are, in fact, not breaking even every month. Like, credit card debt is freaking scary. So yes, we just don't control the market conditions. If market conditions stabilize, I think prices will be stable. If they're not stable, then we would have to lower prices then. Yes.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nThank you. Let's go to Colin Rusch from Oppenheimer.\n\nColin William Rusch\n\nAs you're building out Dojo and implementing what truly is going to be a highly complex set of software, can you speak to the maturity of the operating system and how much outsourced software you're expecting to use in that system?\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nThis is a custom software stack. But it is designed such that you can run, at a high level, PyTorch and JAX. But then we have to customize it to actually run on a custom silicon. So the software stack is a combination of open source software and then Tesla software, all the way to the bare silicon, which is the case for the inference computer in the car.\n\nColin William Rusch\n\nOkay. That's super helpful. And then can you speak to how you're managing some of the geopolitical risks relative to your capacity expansion? Obviously, as you guys continue to grow at this rate, you're going to be putting some folks out of business. And there's going to be some impacts around regional economy. So I just want to understand how you're thinking about that in terms of some of your CapEx plans and how you're managing some of those relationships with different countries and regions.\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nWell, this is a period of unusual geopolitical risk. So I think we're -- the best we can do is have factories in many parts of the world such that, if things get difficult in one part of the world, we can still keep things going in the rest of the world.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nThank you. The next question comes from Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs.\n\nMark Trevor Delaney\n\nTesla has been making progress reducing costs and did so again last quarter. Can you give an update on when you think automotive COGS per vehicle could be under the historical $36,000 per vehicle level? And what are the key puts and takes to get there?\n\nZachary John Planell Kirkhorn\n\nThis is -- I think I was asked this in the past. This is very difficult to forecast. There's a series of costs that we manage, the series of cost in which we don't control. And so particularly on the commodity side, where labor cost go, et cetera, it's just hard to say.\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nYes. And we saw very inflationary -- like strong inflationary pressures for a while last year, and now -- which obviously makes it very difficult to reduce COGS. And now we're seeing what seems to be deflationary pressures, certainly deflationary -- deflation isn't pressure. But we're seeing commodity prices dropping as was mentioned -- as Karn mentioned a moment ago. And look, I mean what do you think? I mean, basically, the trends seem to be deflationary at the commodity level.\n\nKarn Budhiraj\n\nDefinitely. There's that, and then there's also the unit economics improve as volumes grow. That's the other thing we're seeing. As we're becoming a bigger and better part of a lot of suppliers, the economies of scale come into play. There's equipment depreciation that comes into play. Equipment that was commissioned 5 to 7 years ago, that used to be a part of the piece price, that's completely amortized. So we'll see situations where the piece price comes down because that equipment contribution has gone away. And then just as we continue to have this mentality of continuous improvement in terms of labor, reducing labor, improving automation, and just continue to get better at what we do. So we have seen -- I think every quarter, we have seen an improvement. Of course, the commodities spike up and down. Just in general, the trend is towards being more efficient.\n\nZachary John Planell Kirkhorn\n\nYes, I totally agree.\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nYes, lithium prices weren't absolutely insane there for a while.\n\nZachary John Planell Kirkhorn\n\nYes. And they're recovering now.\n\nKarn Budhiraj\n\nCobalt is like 1/3 of the way it used to be.\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nYes.\n\nZachary John Planell Kirkhorn\n\nYes. And we're still early in the ramp -- well, not early in the ramp, but early in the cost-down curve of Austin and Berlin. And so it takes time to work the cost out. First, it's a focus on ramp. Ramp brings cost down effectively.\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nRamp quality costs.\n\nZachary John Planell Kirkhorn\n\nYes. And then once that stabilizes, we can divert bandwidth to cost reduction. And so Austin and Berlin saw quite a decent amount of cost reduction on a fundamental basis from Q1 to Q2. If we continue to do that work, that will be helpful. And so we're just going to keep chipping away at it.\n\nUnidentified Company Representative\n\nYes, packaging is a big element to that.\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nYes, right. Logistics, too.\n\nZachary John Planell Kirkhorn\n\nLogistics is normalizing, which is great.\n\nUnidentified Company Representative\n\nUtilization is something that the team has been very focused on, so every bit of it.\n\nZachary John Planell Kirkhorn\n\nAnd it's hard...\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nYes. Logistics is underappreciated. Yes, so as the saying goes, like, [sales and order tactics wasn't worth] of logistics.\n\nUnidentified Company Representative\n\nYes. And we've made tremendous improvements in cost on all fronts, expedite costs. We are down pre-pandemic expedited cost levels now, and our goal is to go further down.\n\nZachary John Planell Kirkhorn\n\nYes. So when we look at our progress from Q1 to Q2 on cost, the way that we look at it internally, normalized for the impacts of mix shift, with Austin and Berlin being a higher percentage of our mix; normalized for S and X being a higher percentage of our mix in Q2 versus Q1. The sequential cost reduction, it might be the largest we've had in a while. So I think it's great work on behalf of the Tesla team, and we just got to keep it up.\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nYes, it's a game of pennies. It's like Game of Thrones but pennies.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nMark, do you have a follow-up question? I think you're muted.\n\nMark Trevor Delaney\n\nYes. Maybe you could put a finer point on the downtime impact that you spoke about in your prepared comments in terms of production impacts and then also to what extent there's a margin impact from those factory upgrades that you're planning this quarter.\n\nZachary John Planell Kirkhorn\n\nYes, the downtime -- look, we don't know exactly the number of cars impacted because kind of the way that we go into downtime windows for upgrades is we set aside a period of time, but then the team is challenged to go as quickly as possible so that we can get the factories up and running again and minimize that. It's not a profound reduction. Hopefully, it's small.\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nI think we're getting too much into the weeds here. I mean like you're asking for a level of precision that is not possible to answer. So let's move on.\n\nMartin Viecha\n\nYes. I think this is unfortunately all the time we have for today. So we'll speak to you all in the next 3 months. Thank you very much.\n\nElon R. Musk\n\nGreat.

With the exception of Nvidia, those top tech stocks are largely focused on the cloud (MSFT and AMZN), the internet (GOOG and AMZN), software (MSFT), or hardware (Apple). While the cloud and the internet will, of course, continue to be hugely important parts of tech going forward, I believe that they will become somewhat less of a focal point for investors over the long term, while software and hardware will not be major forces in the stock market at all. Instead, in the upcoming age of artificial intelligence, automation and the chips that enable it will get the most attention from the Street. With that said, here are my candidates for the seven top tech stocks of the future.\n\nServiceNow (NOW) ServiceNow office building in Silicon Valley;\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) appears to be the \u201ctop dog\u201d at this point when it comes to the huge field of automating IT functions. As AI evolves, this field will only get bigger and more lucrative as more functions can be automated, causing NOW\u2019s total addressable market and financial results to climb parabolically.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nEncouragingly. NOW is working hard to incorporate AI into its operations by, for example, recently launching an AI-powered system that will allow developers to more easily launch apps on its platform. Further, it\u2019s using AI to enable its customers to ship products faster and make programming easier for them.\n\nImpressively, fintel.io gives NOW stock a high Fund Sentiment Scire of 82.39 out of 100, indicating that the \u201cBig Money\u201d remains quite enamored with the name. I expect their fondness for NOW to increase rapidly as the months and years go by.\n\nWorkday (WDAY) Workday Layoffs. A close-up view of a Workday (WDAY Stock) sign in Pleasanton, California.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nWorkday\u2019s (NASDAQ:WDAY) cloud applications enable companies to easily manage their finances and human resources functions. It also has apps that allow companies to efficiently analyze their operations and plan initiatives using AI.\n\nTop mutual funds bought $27.6 million of WDAY stock, indicating that some of the best-performing mutual funds are very bullish on WDAY, according to Investor\u2019s Business Daily.\n\nAnd in a note to investors on June 28, RBC Capital, a prominent Canadian bank, started coverage of WDAY stock with an \u201coutperform\u201d rating. According to the bank, WDAY \u2018s subscription revenue will probably surge at least 20% annually for many years, as many businesses are increasingly adopting both its financial and HR offerings. Additionally, its planning app \u201cis gaining meaningful traction against the competition,\u201d RBC reported. The bank also believes that the company tends to make very good acquisitions.\n\nAnalysts, on average, expect workday\u2019s earnings per share to surge to $6.41 next year from $3.64 last year.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) a close up image of a semiconductor\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) is a rare hardware company that looks poised to become explosively successful in the AI-dominated world of the future. That\u2019s because, as I pointed out in a previous column, the company markets servers that are very well-suited for creating AI. One of its servers, for example, \u201csupports up to 10 next-gen accelerators.\u201d AI is produced using accelerators.\n\nIndeed investment bank Rosenblatt Securities has maintained that Super Micro Computer \u201c\u2026is perfectly positioned to profit from the AI-driven spending trend,\u201d Investor\u2019s Business Daily reported. The bank is also upbeat on the company\u2019s \u201d liquid cooling at scale\u201d solution, which effectively combats overheating, allowing more power to be deployed to its servers. Also noteworthy is that SMCI has partnerships with two of the world\u2019s largest chipmakers: Nvidia and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD).\n\nSMCI has a nearly perfect 98 out of 99 Composite Rating from Investor\u2019s Business Daily, and IBD gives it an Acc/Dis rating of A+, showing that large investors have been buying plenty of its shares in the past 13 weeks.\n\nIntel (INTC) Close up of Intel (INTC) sign at entrance of The Intel Museum in Silicon Valley. Intel is an American multinational corporation and technology company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) also looks poised to get a big boost from the proliferation of AI, as its Gaudi 2 chips can be used to produce the technology. The Gaudi chips are reportedly only about one-third as fast as Nvidia\u2019s AI-producing chips. But Intel indicated that its chips are significantly cheaper than Nvidia\u2019s, and companies reportedly have to wait many weeks to obtain Nvidia\u2019s chips. Moreover, multiple commentators have said that Intel\u2019s next Gaudi chip could meaningfully close the gap with Nvidia\u2019s offerings. And a Seeking Alpha columnist reported in late March that its Gaudi chips are already competitive when it comes to facilitating AI inference.\n\nAfter Nvidia\u2019s CEO said in May that he was pleased with the result of a test of Intel\u2019s manufacturing capabilities, it looks probable that Intel will manufacture chips for Nvidia, the world\u2019s largest maker of AI semiconductors. That, in turn, should convince other chip makers to let Intel manufacture their chips, turning Intel into a semiconductor manufacturing powerhouse.\n\nOn Semiconductor (ON) semiconductor stocks Close-up electronic circuit board. technology style concept. representing semiconductor stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAs I noted in a previous column, \u201cOn Semiconductor (NASDAQ:ON) is a chipmaker that\u2019s highly leveraged to the automotive and industrial end markets, both of which are growing rapidly.\u201d\n\nElectrification of transportation and increased use of chips in vehicles, partly to enable semi-autonomous driving, are boosting On\u2019s revenue from autos, while the company\u2019s industrial business has also grown very rapidly in recent quarters.\n\nIn the first quarter, the company\u2019s automotive sales jumped 38% versus the same quarter a year earlier to a \u201crecord 50% of total revenue,\u201d while its \u201cAutomotive and industrial end-markets together represented record 79% of revenue.\u201d The results bode very well for the company\u2019s longer-term outlook.\n\nInvestor\u2019s Business Dailygives ON a very high Composite Rating of 92, including a Relative Strength rating of 96, indicating that investors have been very upbeat about the name in the last year.\n\nAurora Innovations (AUR) a phone displaying the Aurora website in front of a computer screen displaying the company logo\n\nSource: T.

Moreover, the firm has said that all of the necessary features have already been added to its platform.\n\nAurora anticipates that it will begin generating meaningful revenue from its platform by the conclusion of its next fiscal year.\n\nAccording to Investor\u2019s Business Daily, the name has an Accumulation/Distribution rating of A+, indicating that large investors have been buying a great deal of the stock in the last 13 weeks.\n\nStem (STEM) Black and cyber blue illustration of brain made out of light of circuit board with chip at the center of the brain, representing artificial intelligence (AI) stocks\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/cono0430\n\nStem\u2019s (NYSE:STEM) utilization of AI to make electricity use and the utilization of renewable energy more efficient will transform it into one of the most successful companies of the future.\n\nAmong its customers are several huge firms, including Apple, Home Depot (NYSE:HD), and Walmart (NYSE:WMT). The fact that such heavyweights utilize its technology largely validates STEM and its technology.\n\nAlso noteworthy is that investment bank Janney Montgomery started the name with a \u201cbuy\u201d rating and $12 price target last month, citing the company\u2019s outlook for positive adjusted EBITDA in the second half of this year. The firm\u2019s forecast of adjusted positive EBITDA in the second half bodes well for its longer-term performance.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer was long INTC, SMCI, STEM and AUR, while his wife was long NOW.

Photo: Netflix/Cinesite/Hivemind\n\nNetflix (NFLX)\n\nNetflix shares have tumbled 7% in pre-market trading, almost giving up the entirety of its rally the last week, as its second quarter revenue fell short of forecasts.\n\nThe streaming platform added that guidance on revenue for this quarter was $8.52bn (\u00a36.6bn), also short of expectations of $8.67bn.\n\nHowever, the company said its subscriber growth reaccelerated as a result of the crackdown on password sharing, and as part of this shift it will be stopping its most basic plan offering to new and rejoining members in the UK. An ad supported plan will instead be taking its place.\n\n\u201cNetflix posted fairly robust Q2 numbers, though the stock had recently proved very strong so there is a little disappointment that they were not a huge beat,\u201d Ben Barringer, equity research analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said.\n\n\u201cNetflix has not upped its prices this year which dampened revenue growth somewhat, but it continues to build scale and grow average revenue per user as more subscribers move to the ad supported tier providing a significant benefit from advertising uplift. Profitability was also much improved as Netflix\u2019s content spend grew far slower than revenue growth.\u201d\n\nEasyjet (EZJ.L)\n\nEasyjet saw its spring profits beat analysts\u2019 expectations on Thursday as demand for foreign holidays boomed in the midst of the cost of living crisis.\n\nThe airline reported a pre-tax profit of \u00a3203m in the three months to June, \u00a342m more than analysts had forecast, according to the consensus tracked by Bloomberg.\n\nRevenue per seat, a key metric of profitability, rose by 23% year-on-year, with a forecast of a 10% annual increase over the following quarter. Ancillary revenues, which include the likes of customer payments for personally allocated seats, baggage and food, jumped 26%.\n\nWinter bookings were up by more than 100pc year-on-year and Easyjet said it had increased its planned capacity by 15% to meet the needs of strong winter demand.\n\nDespite the positive update, shares slipped 3% in London on Thursday.\n\nRead more: LIVE: FTSE climbs higher as Russia attack sends wheat prices soaring\n\n\u201cAs ever, there are potential flies in the ointment, not least of which is the current sector challenges of constrained air space and Air Traffic Control disruptions. The resilience of the consumer had also been a concern given the parlous economic backdrop in the UK, but for the moment there are few signs of holidays being sacrificed come what may,\u201d Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, said.\n\n\u201cEasyJet is clearly on a strong flight path, but the share price recovery still has far to go. Despite a hike of 26% over the last year, as compared to a decline of 0.4% for the wider FTSE250, the shares remain down by 24% over the last two years and by 60% from the levels leading into the pandemic, when the share price was nudging \u00a313.\n\n\u201cThis latest update should provide significant promise on more immediate prospects, with the market consensus of the shares as a strong hold quite likely to come under upward pressure.\u201d\n\nTesla (TSLA)\n\nTesla is down 3% in pre-market trading after it reported that operating margins had dropped to 9.6% in the latest quarter, partially driven by increased spend on large products such as the Cybertruck and AI.\n\nThe car-maker also revealed that factory downtime would lead to lower production and that there could be further price reductions.\n\nHowever, second quarter revenue came in at $24.9bn (\u00a319.3bn), topping street estimates of $24.51, with adjusted EPS coming in at $0.91, compared to estimates of $0.81. That revenue figure represents a slight gain from Q1 and a gain of over 45% from a year ago.\n\nRevenue from the core automotive business rose 46% year-on-year to $21.27bn, which was +6.5% sequentially.\n\nOn the profitability end, Tesla reported adjusted net income of $3.1 billion, compared to estimates of $2.87 billion and more than the $2.9 billion adjusted net income from Q1.\n\nRead more: Musk Says Tesla to Spend Over $1 Billion on Dojo Supercomputer\n\nBut in terms of overall production Elon Musk, chief executive, said on the conference call that Q3 production would decrease slightly due to downtime stemming from factory upgrades. It stuck to its 1.8 million unit guidance and 50% annual unit growth.\n\n\u201cTesla is a leader in a very uncertain automotive environment, which is going through a massive change so still represents a solid company,\u201d Mamta Valechha, equity research analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said.\n\nBabcock (BAB.L)\n\nBabcock profits plunged on a dispute with the Ministry of Defence (MoD) but shares rose 10% on the day.\n\nThe firm reported a jump in annual revenues and said it had made \u201cexcellent\u201d progress despite the profit slide.\n\nRevenues for the year to 31 March rose 8% to \u00a34.44bn, while the contract backlog rose 7% organically to \u00a39.5bn.\n\nBut operating profits fell to \u00a345.5m, from \u00a3226.8m a year previously, after the group was hit by a \u00a3100.1m loss on a Type 31 frigate contract. Losses per share were 6.9p, compared to earnings per share of 32.5p in 2022.\n\nDavid Lockwood, chief executive, said the firm remained committed to reinstating the dividend.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made excellent progress this year, with better-than-expected cash generation, margin expansion and double-digit revenue growth,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIn a world of significant instability, national security has never been more important.

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures were indicating lower, while European stocks recovered ground lost in early trade.\n\nABB said its orders in China, its second-biggest market, fell 9% in the three months to the end of June, with its electrification, motion and robotics divisions all seeing lower demand.\n\nABB, whose results are seen as a bellwether for the health of the broader industrial economy with its motors, drives, controllers and electrification products used in transport systems and factories, also saw lower demand in Germany.\n\nThe comments will unsettle investors, who had hoped that Beijing's decision to abandon strict and prolonged COVID curbs at the end of last year would revive the world's second-biggest economy.\n\nData this week showed China's economy grew at a frail pace in the second quarter as demand weakened at home and abroad, with post-COVID momentum faltering rapidly.\n\nAdding to the overall gloom, Taiwanese chipmaker TSMC forecast a 10% drop in 2023 sales as global economic woes dented demand for chips used in applications as varied as cars, cellphones and servers.\n\nSome earnings highlighted the challenge for companies trying to protect margins after raising prices to offset high energy and raw material costs since last year.\n\nAnalysts have warned easing input costs will put pressure on companies to start cutting prices, or they may lose business.\n\nLate on Wednesday, Tesla CEO Elon Musk signalled he would cut prices again on electric vehicles to shield against competition and economic uncertainty. Its shares were down almost 4% in pre-market U.S. trade.\n\n\"One day it seems like the world economy is falling apart, next day it's fine. I don't know what the hell is going on,\" Musk told analysts on a conference call. \"We're in, I would call it, turbulent times.\"\n\nSwedish hygiene product maker Essity's second-quarter earnings missed market expectations, hit by wage inflation, bigger marketing costs in its consumer goods unit, and lower volumes after price hikes.\n\nElectrolux, Europe's biggest home appliances maker, swung to a loss as cash-strapped shoppers opted for cheaper products and demand from residential property builders slowed.\n\nInvestors punished the companies' shares. Essity stock lost 11% in early trading, set for its worst day on record while Electrolux was down 15.7%, the biggest faller in Europe and on track for their worst day in 12 years.\n\nDOWNBEAT TONE\n\nThe results set a downbeat tone early in the earnings season, with soaring shopping and food bills and high interest rates curbing consumer spending and pressures building on corporate profit margins.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, streaming video pioneer Netflix disappointed Wall Street with second-quarter revenue that fell short of analyst estimates, sending shares tumbling nearly 9% in after-hours trading.\n\nEarnings at STOXX 600 companies are currently expected to fall by 9.2% in the second quarter, a big downturn from 11% growth in the first three months of the year, based on Refinitiv I/B/E/S data.\n\nThat's down from 29% a year ago, when the economy was recovering from the end of COVID lockdowns.

Meanwhile, the parade of quarterly results in the U.S. marches on, and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) reportedly becomes the latest contender in the race to develop generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology.\n\n1. Tesla margins fall; Netflix revenue disappoints\n\nShares in Tesla and Netflix both dropped in premarket trading as investors digested mixed second-quarter results from the electric carmaker and the streaming giant.\n\nFor Tesla, attention centered around recent price cuts to boost volumes and combat intensifying competition in the electric vehicle market. The decision pushed revenues up to a record high of $24.93 billion during the three-month period.\n\nBut the move also weighed on its gross profit margin from automotive operations, excluding the impact of regulatory credits, which dropped to 18.2% from 18.8% in the first quarter and 26.2% last year. Although that decline was not as large as many analysts had expected, Tesla's stock still slumped after chief executive Elon Musk later suggested that more price reductions could be coming this year.\n\nMeanwhile, Netflix's crackdown on password sharing between users appears to be working, with the company adding 5.9 million subscribers in the quarter, far above Wall Street estimates. It also told analysts that the number of canceled accounts was \"low.\"\n\nHowever, this trend was overshadowed by softer-than-anticipated revenue of $8.2B. Netflix's third-quarter projection of $8.5B for the top-line figure missed forecasts as well. Shares in Netflix tumbled as a result.\n\n2. Nasdaq futures slump\n\nFutures for the Nasdaq pointed lower on Thursday as results from Tesla and Netflix weighed on the broader tech sector.\n\nAt 05:14 ET (09:14 GMT), Nasdaq 100 futures shed 141 points or 0.88%, pulled lower by an after-hours decline in shares of the two major tech players that extended into premarket trading.\n\nS&P 500 futures also edged down by 9 points or 0.20%, while Dow futures added 31 points or 0.09%.\n\nThe broad-based Dow Jones Industrial Average posted its eighth consecutive session of gains on Wednesday, its longest winning streak since 2019. Meanwhile, the benchmark S&P 500 climbed 0.24% and the Nasdaq Composite inched up 0.03%.\n\n3. Johnson & Johnson, American Airlines highlight busy earnings day\n\nA fresh batch of U.S. corporate earnings is scheduled to be released Thursday, with health care behemoth Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and carrier American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) among the biggest brands to report.\n\nInsurer Travelers (NYSE:TRV), investment manager Blackstone (NYSE:BX), tobacco group Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM), and regional lender Fifth Third Bank (NASDAQ:FITB) also feature on the results calendar.\n\nEarnings have largely been stronger-than-expected during this latest earnings season, fuelling hopes that this could be a sign that the U.S. economy may be able to engineer a soft landing after a series of aggressive Federal Reserve interest rate hikes. According to FactSet data cited by CNBC, three-quarters of the firms that have already reported beat Wall Street estimates.\n\n4. Apple testing ChatGPT rival - Bloomberg\n\nApple is developing a new generative AI program to compete with the likes of OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Bard, according to Bloomberg News.\n\nWorkers at the tech giant have already constructed a framework, known as \"Ajax,\" the report said, citing people familiar with the matter. A chatbot dubbed \"AppleGPT\" is also being tested.\n\nShares in Apple touched a fresh record high on the report, while peers such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Google-owner Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) dropped.\n\nCalifornia-based Apple, which has stayed relatively quiet on the subject of AI despite a surge in the technology's popularity this year, did not respond to a request for comment from Reuters.\n\n5. TSMC pessimistic on hopes for AI-driven boost in chip demand\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TW:2340) (NYSE:TSM) -- also known as TSMC -- posted second-quarter earnings that topped estimates, but the world's biggest contract chipmaker poured cold water on expectations that the boom in AI interest will fuel a surge in chip demand.\n\nNet profit at TSMC in the three months to June 30 tumbled by more than a fifth to 181.80B Taiwan dollars, although this was still above expectations of analysts polled by Refinitiv.\n\nBut, in a post-earnings webcast, chief executive C.C. Wei flagged that the rush into AI may not be long-term or sustainable. He noted that \"[while] we have recently observed an increase in AI-related demand, it is not enough to offset the overall cyclicality of our business.\"\n\nTSMC subsequently slashed its annual revenue guidance, saying it expects the figure to slip by 10% in 2023 versus its previous outlook for a single-digit drop. U.S.-listed shares in TSMC were lower in premarket trading Thursday.\n\nThe move stood in contrast to bullish comments earlier this year from the chip industry from Nvidia, one of TSMC's largest customers. Nvidia previously forecast a jump in semiconductor demand later this year, citing the need for computing parts to power AI programs.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nTesla, Netflix earnings; Apple reportedly tests AI tools - what's moving markets\n\nFed's top regulatory official faces uphill battle to overhaul bank capital\n\nBoE reports second-biggest usage of short-term liquidity repo", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-netflix-earnings-apple-reportedly-051930468.html", "symbols": ["2330.TW", "AAL.US", "AAPL.MX", "AAPL.US", "AAPL34.SA", "APC.F", "APC.XETRA", "BX.US", "FITB.US", "GOOGL.US", "IXIC.INDX", "JNJ.US", "MSFT.US", "NFC.F", "NFLX.US", "NVDA.US", "PM.US", "TRV.US", "TSFA.F"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.965, "neg": 0.038, "neu": 0.892, "pos": 0.07}}, {"date": "2023-07-20T03:53:44+00:00", "title": "European stocks mixed; corporate earnings in focus", "content": "Investing.com - European stock markets traded in a mixed fashion Thursday, as investors digested more corporate earnings with the tech sector particularly fragile following weak cues from Wall Street.\n\nAt 03:40 ET (07:40 GMT), the DAX index in Germany traded 0.1% lower, while the FTSE 100 in the U.K. gained 0.5% and the CAC 40 in France rose 0.1%.\n\nEarnings season starts to ramp up\n\nThe quarterly earnings season is starting to ramp up in Europe.\n\nNokia (HE:NOKIA) stock fell 0.6% after the Finnish telecom gear group reported a drop in second-quarter profit as growth in sales of 5G gear in low-margin markets such as India failed to offset slowing demand in North America.\n\nVolvo Car (ST:VOLCARb) stock fell 4.8% after the Sweden-based automaker reported a 54% fall in second-quarter operating earnings with last year's profit was boosted by a one-off gain, while also acknowledging pricing pressures ahead.\n\nElectrolux (ST:ELUXb) dropped 10.7% after Europe's biggest home appliances maker swung to a loss in the second quarter.\n\nOn the flip side, Saab (ST:SAABb) stock climbed 3% after the Swedish defence group raised its organic sales growth guidance, while Publicis (EPA:PUBP) stock soared 4.3% after the French advertising giant lifted its 2023 guidance on the back of steady organic growth in its second quarter.\n\nNetflix, Tesla misses weigh on tech sector\n\nA lot of attention is on the tech sector Thursday after streaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) reported a miss with second-quarter revenue despite the addition of 5.9 million new streaming customers.\n\nAdditionally, EV manufacturer Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) said its profitability shrank in the second quarter, with CEO Elon Musk signaling he would cut prices again in \"turbulent times\", as his price war on automaker rivals hits the company's own margins.\n\nIn Asia earlier Thursday, Taiwanese chipmaker TSMC (NYSE:TSM) posted a 23.3% fall in second-quarter net profit as global economic woes dented demand for chips used in various applications.\n\nGerman producer prices fall\n\nGerman producer prices fell 0.3% on the month in June, suggesting inflationary pressures are lessening in the eurozone\u2019s largest economy.\n\nData released Wednesday confirmed that eurozone inflation rose 5.5% on the year last month, a drop from 6.1% the prior month.\n\nThe European Central Bank is widely expected to raise its benchmark rate by 25 basis points next week, but what comes after that has been up for debate in the wake of the recent dovish tone taken by the central bank's policymakers.\n\nIn the U.S., jobless claims and housing sales headline an otherwise sparse data calendar later Thursday.\n\nOil prices steady despite falling U.S. inventories\n\nOil prices steadied Thursday after losses this week on the back of a strengthening dollar, making crude more expensive for foreign buyers, and with U.S. inventories falling less than expected.\n\nThe Energy Information Administration announced Wednesday that U.S. crude stockpiles fell by 708,000 barrels last week, much lower than expectations for a 2.4 million barrel draw.\n\nThis suggests fuel demand was struggling in the world\u2019s largest consumer despite the travel-heavy summer season, as it followed a bigger-than-expected build in the inventories the prior week.\n\nBy 03:40 ET, the U.S. crude futures traded 0.2% higher at $75.43 a barrel, while the Brent contract dropped 0.2% to $79.61.

The shares have risen 90% in Hong Kong this year, with bears positioned near the lowest level since September, according to IHS Markit data. The firm has held off in cutting prices for its models.\n\nThere\u2019s also BYD Co., the EV leader that overtook Volkswagen as the best-selling car brand in China in the first quarter, which has seen shares jump 38% this year in Hong Kong. That\u2019s more than double the global industry gauge\u2019s 17% rise. BYD has also seen growing market share, chipping away at Tesla Inc.\u2019s portion in recent years, according to data from the Passenger Car Association.\n\nRead: How China Beat Everyone to Be World Champ in Electric Vehicles\n\nThe strong sales underscore robust demand for local clean vehicles despite China\u2019s lackluster consumer spending, thanks to favorable government policies, strong product roll-outs and attractive pricing. There\u2019s further upside as analysts say the recent demand recovery may boost margins in the second half.\n\n\u201cValuations are not too rich yet so the rally has legs so long as the companies can deliver on their monthly numbers,\u201d said Kevin Net, head of Asian equities at LA Banque Postale Asset Management, adding that he\u2019s \u201cless concerned now\u201d compared to earlier this year when Tesla kicked off its aggressive pricing strategy.\n\nBYD is trading at 23.5 times forward earnings, about one-third of its average over the past three years. Meanwhile, Tesla is trading at about 70.5 times, its highest level since May 2022.\n\nA number of large banks and brokers have turned more favorable on the sector. HSBC Holdings Plc. forecasts that China new energy vehicle sales may reach 8.2 million units this year, a 10% upgrade from its earlier forecasts. \u201cAs prices stabilize, we see a stronger demand recovery, as consumers who have been waiting for a better price are more likely to buy a new car,\u201d analyst Yuqian Ding wrote in a report.\n\nSanford C Bernstein is also turning more positive on China\u2019s auto cycle after seeing improving retail demand. The brokerage holds a cautiously optimistic view, expecting consumer confidence and credit impulse to support auto demand in the coming months.\n\nThere are some risks, however. The summer months tend to be the softest in terms of demand, which could hurt the recent momentum for Chinese shares. There are also signs of overheating, with Li Auto and XPeng Inc. nearing technically overbought levels. Bearish bets in particular for XPeng are hovering near a record high in Hong Kong after nearly doubling in its share price recently.\n\nForeign players have also had some strong share rallies, with Tesla gaining more than 136% since the start of the year, in part due to an artificial intelligence boom.\n\nThe next focus will be on the outlook for margin trajectory and delivery momentum of new models announced during second-quarter earnings released next month, Morgan Stanley analysts including Cindy Huang wrote in a note.\n\nEarly indications show things are holding strong. BYD reported a threefold increase in preliminary earnings for the first six months and its profit per vehicle may have risen to 8,000 yuan ($1,108.5) in the second quarter, up from the previous quarter\u2019s 7,500 yuan, according to Citigroup Inc.\u2019s estimates.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nNetflix Inc. projected third-quarter revenue that fell short of Wall Street estimates, suggesting a crackdown on password sharing and a new advertising tier aren\u2019t yet delivering the sales growth analysts anticipated. Tesla Inc. is sparing no expense to become a player in supercomputing, with Elon Musk saying the electric carmaker plans to invest more than $1 billion on its so-called Project Dojo by the end of 2024. Tencent Holdings Ltd. co-founder Pony Ma has penned a lengthy op-ed backing Chinese pledges to resuscitate the private sector, becoming the most prominent entrepreneur to endorse Beijing\u2019s promises to unshackle a giant swath of the economy. International Business Machines Corp. maintained its full-year forecast of 3% to 5% sales growth, overcoming investor anxiety about weakening demand for internet technology.\n\n--With assistance from Jeanny Yu.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nNo Testing, No Inspections: Contaminated Eyedrops Blinded and Killed Americans WeightWatchers Is Gambling Everything on Obesity Drugs This Supposed Mafia Manifesto Doesn\u2019t Stand Up to a Google Search What If the Next Big Social Media App Is ...

Even if you don\u2019t get rich from them this year, buying now should lead to substantial long-term returns.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) on stock market. Tesla financial success and profit.\n\nSource: Rokas Tenys / Shutterstock.com\n\nAfter a brutal 14 months, during which Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock lost three-quarters of its value, it has come roaring back. Shares of the premier electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer have surged 186% since hitting a 52-week low in early January.\n\nThis outperformance is underpinned by robust delivery numbers that continue to turn heads each quarter. Earlier this month, Tesla reported second-quarter deliveries that blew past Wall Street\u2019s forecast. The company delivered a record 466,140 EVs, easily exceeding the 445,000 analysts predicted.\n\nFor the full year, analysts expect Tesla to deliver 1.82 million EVs, which would be a nearly 39% increase over 2022, aided by the company\u2019s recent price cuts and federal EV tax credits.\n\nAccording to activist investor Ross Gerber, much of Tesla\u2019s recent success is due to Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Elon Musk renewing his focus on the company after handing over the reins of Twitter to Linda Yaccarino on June 6. Indeed, since Musk stepped down from Twitter, TSLA stock has gained 35%.\n\nWhile price cuts have hit margins, Tesla just reported record quarterly revenue of $24.93 billion for the second quarter and a 20% year-over-year increase in net income to $2.7 billion.\n\nTesla will continue to outshine traditional automakers. Given its dominant market position and potential for sustained sales growth and profitability improvements, its soaring valuation is justified. As Tesla\u2019s momentum continues, it\u2019s a story that investors cannot ignore.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) Threads app logo seen on screen. Instagram Threads app is a micro blogging platform, developed by Facebook Meta.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nLess than a year ago, skeptics had written off Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) as a fallen star. Big losses from the company\u2019s Reality Labs venture and a tepid advertising landscape painted a rather bleak portrait of a firm past its prime. Analysts warned of a rocky road ahead for the social media behemoth, whose shares declined as much as 77% in just over a year.\n\nBut 2023 ushered in a seismic shift for Meta. In late 2022, CEO Mark Zuckerberg spearheaded aggressive layoffs and budget trims, effectively streamlining company operations.\n\nMoreover, the firm has made headlines with several new product rollouts, including its upcoming Meta Quest 3 virtual reality headset and ChatGPT-like AI tools for Messenger and WhatsApp.\n\nAnother feather in Meta\u2019s cap is the recent launch of Threads, a Twitter-esque app that has beaten ChatGPT to become the fastest-growing app worldwide, amassing a staggering 100 million users in a few days.\n\nThese strategic moves have rekindled investor confidence in Meta Platforms, refuting claims of its supposed decline and sending shares up 163% year to date. But this is likely only the beginning for the innovative company.\n\nLithium Americas (LAC) smartphone with logo of Canadian company Lithium Americas Corp on screen\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nUnlike the other names on today\u2019s list of stocks for getting rich, Lithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) has underperformed thus far in 2023, rising just 11% compared with a 19% advance for the S&P 500. Yet, despite the sideways movement in the stock over the past year, business developments point to a significant upside breakout in the cards.\n\nIn May, the company\u2019s board approved a plan to split its North American and Argentine operations into two separate publicly traded companies. This move should unlock substantial long-term value for shareholders.\n\nIts North American operations are focused on the Thacker Pass project in Nevada, one of the largest known lithium resources in the U.S. with an impressive after-tax net present value of nearly $5 billion. With the project expected to deliver average annual EBITDA of $1.2 billion over a 40-year mine lifespan, the asset could generate colossal cash flows once production begins.\n\nLithium Americas recently partnered with General Motors (NYSE:GM), which plans to invest $650 million in the Thacker Pass project. This strategic alliance and a binding supply agreement provide the firm with a clear vision of future cash flows, solidifying its potential in the space.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines\n\nMuslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

Months of markdowns have already taken a toll on Tesla\u2019s gross margin, which fell to 18.2% in the second quarter, a three-year low.\n\nTesla is also pouring money into other investments, including its newest model, the Cybertruck, and Dojo, an in-house supercomputer that Musk said the company will spend at least $1 billion on by the end of next year. And while Tesla remains on track to produce around 1.8 million vehicles in 2023, output will dip this quarter due to factory upgrades.\n\nThe CEO characterized the smaller profits as speed bumps in a broader growth story, and claimed Tesla could one day be 10 times its current size. Investors still reacted negatively, with the stock falling 4% at 7:45 p.m. Wednesday in New York, after more than doubling so far this year.\n\n\u201cIt does make sense to sacrifice margins in favor of making more vehicles because we think in the not-too-distant future they will have a dramatic valuation increase,\u201d Musk said.\n\nRead More: Musk Says Tesla to Spend Over $1 Billion on Dojo Supercomputer\n\nTesla\u2019s strategy of cutting prices to increase sales volume \u2014 a reaction to stretched household budgets and new competitors \u2014 has been working. The company beat both earnings and revenue expectations in the second quarter and had already announced record vehicle deliveries for the period.\n\n\u201cGiven the stock\u2019s meteoric run-up so far in \u201923, investor expectations were clearly high heading into the release,\u201d Garrett Nelson of CFRA Research said in a note to clients.\n\nThe carmaker\u2019s profit, excluding some items, came to 91 cents a share, more than the 81 cents that analysts estimated. Revenue rose 47% to $24.9 billion, better than consensus expectations for $24.5 billion.\n\nThe company didn\u2019t break out its automotive margin, a closely watched gauge of Tesla\u2019s profitability, which was more than 30% at the start of last year. Barclays analyst Dan Levy calculated the margin to be 18.1% for the quarter, excluding regulatory credits.\n\nIn January, Tesla Chief Financial Officer Zachary Kirkhorn said he was targeting a 20% auto margin for the year, excluding regulatory credits. That\u2019s been tough to maintain amid a broader slowdown in EV buying and ballooning inventories, and Kirkhorn walked back the forecast in April.\n\nInventory Buildup\n\nAdding to the Austin-based carmaker\u2019s challenges is its ever-larger inventory of cars. The company said it now has 16 days\u2019 worth of supply globally, up from 15 days last quarter and four days a year ago.\n\nThat\u2019s after months of markdowns on Tesla\u2019s best-selling models, and perks including free charging that the carmaker has offered.\n\nMusk didn\u2019t provide any finer details on the third-quarter production slowdown, calling it a result of \u201csummer shutdowns.\u201d He said earlier this year that the company had \u201ca shot\u201d at making 2 million cars.\n\nWhile analysts have said new models like the Cybertruck could help Tesla maintain its sales-growth rate, the long-awaited truck won\u2019t be available in large volumes until next year. The first Cybertruck rolled off the line in Tesla\u2019s Austin factory just recently, the company said over the weekend.\n\nTesla clarified the Cybertrucks being built now \u2014 roughly two years late \u2014 are actually \u201crelease candidates\u201d and not for sale. The company didn\u2019t offer any updated information about pricing and said it will start deliveries later this year.\n\nMusk also touted Tesla\u2019s driver-assistance software, which the company may make available to other automakers. The CEO said Tesla is in early discussions about potentially licensing its system to a major manufacturer he didn\u2019t name.\n\n(Updates with conference call details from second paragraph.

We have a wide swath of earnings reports across a variety of industries after today\u2019s closing bell, and leading into it we got another up-day in the markets on the major indices across the board. The Dow put up another +111 points, +0.32%, while the S&P 500 gained +0.23%. The Nasdaq was the laggard, sliding into the close, +0.02%, while the small-cap Russell 2000 outperformed yet again, +0.43% on the session.\r\n\r\nTesla TSLA has outperformed estimates on both top and bottom lines in its Q2 report after today\u2019s close, earning 91 cents per share \u2014 8 cents higher than the Zacks consensus, and nicely beyond the 76 cents per share in the year-ago quarter \u2014 on revenues of $24.93 billion, better than the $24.88 billion expected. The EV leader kept full-year delivery guidance in-line with expectations, and gross margins, ex-zero-emissions credits came in up +18.2%, an improvement on the +16.9% estimated. This is lower than the +19.3% reported the previous quarter, which may be due to lowered price points for sold vehicles.\r\n\r\nThis, however, is considered the trough for gross margins minus credits; both the company and analysts expect this number to continue growing from here. Operating margins overall came in at +9.6%. This is the 10th straight earnings beat for CEO Elon Musk\u2019s industry leader, and Tesla has kept full-year revenue guidance in-line with earlier estimates. Shares have been bouncing around on the news, from below $285 per share for a short time and over $295 moments later. Tesla remains one of the best-performing stocks of 2023 so far.\r\n\r\nNetflix NFLX is also out with new Q2 results, which were mixed: earnings of $3.29 per share marked a positive beat of 46 cents, and positive year over year, while its top line narrowly missed expectations to $8.19 billion in the quarter. Net add subscribers more than doubled analyst consensus \u2014 5.89 million versus roughly 2 million expected \u2014 but the revenue miss also carries to full-year guidance, which has been lowered to $8.52 billion from the Zacks consensus $8.63 billion.\r\n\r\nThat said, next-quarter earnings guidance has been bumped up to $3.52 per share, as Netflix shows good results from its preliminary \u201cpaid sharing\u201d program, which is essentially a crackdown on prevalent password-sharing Netflix had been dealing with for years. This plan is expected to fetch $9 billion in revenues through 2025. The company also recently announced it is ending its $10 basic subscription plan. Shares are down more than -3% on this news; Netflix\u2019s high profile likely set investors up for expecting a big beat that did not come.\r\n\r\nIBM IBM also reported Q2 earnings this Hump Day afternoon, beating solidly on the bottom line \u2014 earnings of $2.18 per share amounts to an 18-cent outperformance \u2014 while revenues missed expectations for the second-straight quarter: $15.48 billion versus $15.54 billion our analysts were anticipating. Currency accounted for an 80 basis-point hit, according to the company\u2019s statement, while its Red Hat software segment grew by +11%, outperforming other software developers of late. Shares have ebbed back to -0.87% in the after-market, and shares are still in the red year to date.\r\n\r\nUnited Airlines UAL put up perhaps the most impressive quarterly numbers so far this earnings season, trouncing estimates on its bottom line \u2014 earnings of $5.03 per share is far beyond the $3.99 expected, on sales of $14.17 billion for the quarter, nicely ahead of the $13.93 billion in the Zacks consensus +17% year over year. Passenger per Seat Mile was +2.2% in the quarter, while Cost per Seat Mile also rose, +2%. Guidance is up for both earnings and revenues next quarter, and this is the airline\u2019s fourth-straight earnings beat. Shares are +3.5% in late trading.\r\n\r\nLas Vegas Sands LVS also outperformed on both top and bottom lines: earnings of 46 cents per share bettered estimates by a penny while revenues of $2.54 billion is well beyond the $2.36 billion expected. The international gaming entertainment major also announced it is issuing its first quarterly dividend since prior to the pandemic: 20 cents per share. Property EBITDA in its Macau and Singapore locations was up to $973 million in the quarter \u2014 now 82% of 2019 capacity (the last appropriate comparison). Shares are off their late-session lows, but still down -2.7% this afternoon.\r\n\r\nQuestions or comments about this article and/or author?

Gross margins missed estimates as price cuts took their toll. Let's get you set up for the next trade. Craig Irwin of ROTH Capital joins us now. Craig, good to see you here today. Stock is all over the map. Right now, Tesla shares are higher.\n\nWe were calling out the negative in this report, notably that gross margin whiff. But what is good in this report? And why would the stock be higher?\n\nCRAIG IRWIN: So a lot of people were looking at auto gross margins, right? Not-- not the-- not the headline gross margin. Auto gross margins about 17.5% were in line with what a lot of the buy side was expecting. So the real question is, are we in a trough, right? I obviously don't believe that. You know, I expect more price cuts ahead. And I think that the price elasticity we saw was actually quite sloppy.\n\nBut, you know, the margins on an adjusted basis, auto gross margins, coming in essentially in line would be taken as a positive. And the release didn't really have much in the way of discussion of further price cuts. You know, we did see Ford lead with Lightning Pro price cut of 10 grand just this past week ahead of the Cybertruck official launch. So Tesla has been playing this game. Others are going to play it, too. So you know, let's be careful on that. I think that's a key part of the discussion on this call is going to be price elasticity and price cuts.\n\nSEANA SMITH: Craig, well, a lot of people are also looking at how this is affecting demand, right? With lower prices, you would think that would be a big boost to demand. But when you take a look at these global inventory numbers here, 16 days, that's up from 15. Not a huge jump, but does this signal maybe that we are starting to see lower-than-expected demand for Teslas?\n\nCRAIG IRWIN: Well, absolutely. I mean, you look at the fourth quarter to second quarter comp, I mean, you had roughly 15% price cuts. And it grew volume just 15%. That is tepid at best. I think, you know, Tesla's dominated the market. They've done a phenomenal job. But competitions are real. The environment is difficult. And they do acknowledge that in their release that, you know, this is a good quarter for them, considering the environment. And, you know, that's why I believe we're not seeing a more robust guidance for the end of the year. You know, they're still at that 1.8 million units, which means they are being a little bit careful, a little bit conservative right here.\n\nBRIAN SOZZI: Craig, you think the market is just too optimistic on Tesla? From the standpoint, yes, we all know they're lowering prices. But as we talked about when these numbers broke, they're investing a ton of money in AI and Cybertruck. Now, these things might pay off longer term, but they cost a lot of money today. Do you think Tesla is set up for some earnings misses in the back half of this year because of this aggressive spending?\n\nCRAIG IRWIN: But I don't necessarily think the spending is a bad idea, right? This is a technology company that is playing very efficiently, very effectively in the automotive market. I think where the misses are likely to come from, the reason that I'm very bearish versus my peers, is I think the competition is real. I think that people are much better off investing in other names in the space. I think that you're going to see some very successful vehicle launches from other OEMs. And you're going to see, you know, continued traction with some of these other vehicles.\n\nAnd that means that Tesla will lose share they'll face pricing pressure. And that margins will continue to be under pressure. And you know, that fundamentally is not a good setup. And, you know, things aren't going to get better in '24 than they are in '23. So, you know, we're very bearish on Tesla right here. We see it as egregiously overvalued. We think people are much better off just, you know, looking at many of the other names, either conventional auto OEMs or some of the emerging players as opportunities for investment.\n\nBRIAN SOZZI: Craig, how overvalued? Is this just a $100, $150 stock?\n\nCRAIG IRWIN: I have an $85 price target--\n\nBRIAN SOZZI: $85.\n\nCRAIG IRWIN: Yes. If this stock was to trade in that range, it would be valued somewhere near Toyota. And Toyota has, you know, 5x the number of vehicles roughly that they'll sell this year. Tesla does not have any technology that Toyota does not. Toyota is just a conservative company that delivers and delivers quality.\n\nTesla, you know, you look at the Cybertruck, their photograph shows mismatches on the door. They haven't come through with the wiper technology that they came. It's not an exoskeleton vehicle. I mean, Tesla's-- Tesla's fallen short on that so many times so many ways. And you know, OK, this is not the commercial first vehicle. But, you know, there's obviously fit and finish problems. You know, Toyota doesn't play like that. This has got a lot to learn.\n\nBRIAN SOZZI: Craig, $85. Just given where the results came in, do you think you'll take it down to 50 to 60 bucks? I mean, do you have to make revisions?\n\nCRAIG IRWIN: So I'm always-- I'm always reevaluating my target, my thesis, right? And, you know, the one thing that would have me maybe make a more substantial change to my thesis is the work that they're doing around modular assembly. So this whole thing for the launch of the mini car, where they're looking to take out substantial cost in assembly, that's essential for preserving margins. It would be transformational for the industry.\n\nI've been bearish on that, kind of naysayer. But, you know, some of the auto executives are saying don't count them out. So I'm diligent saying that. I don't see anything in this report yet that would have me dramatically change my opinion. I still think Tesla is egregiously overvalued right here.\n\nBRIAN SOZZI: Craig, I'm scared to look at my Twitter feed from and see what all the Tesla bulls are looking at right now. But, hey, you know what? We appreciate you sticking with your call and doing some deep dive analysis. Craig Irwin, thanks so much.

The company said profits had remained steady due to cost cutting.\n\nAll electric car makers have also had to grapple with a dip in demand, amid the global economic slowdown and an increasingly saturated market. In its results, the company said: \u201cThe challenges of these uncertain times are not over.\u201d\n\nWhile electric vehicle sales are still increasing sharply, in some markets there has been a slowdown in interest, as the premium price of electric cars dissuades many consumers from upgrading. A spike in the cost of electricity has also increased running costs.\n\nMr Musk, who also controls Twitter, rocket company SpaceX, and a new artificial intelligence venture, has repeatedly faced questions from shareholders that he is overstretched.\n\nYet despite having slumped last year, Tesla\u2019s share price has surged so far in 2023, with its stock more than doubling and valuing the company at over $935bn.\n\nThe company has also begun seeing revenue growth from its charging network, after signing up rival car makers such as GM and Ford to adopt its Supercharging standard.

Tesla, on the other hand, beats on revenue and earnings per share projections but falls short of gross margin expectations. Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer, Alexandra Canal, Pras Subramanian break down the top and bottom lines of Netflix and Tesla's second-quarter earnings.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nJOSH SCHAFER: And we're going to be talking Netflix earnings, Tesla earnings. I want to start first with Netflix earnings. We've got Netflix shares down a little bit after-hours here, Allie. Can we just-- what is the main takeaway that you're seeing right now driving shares down?\n\nALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah. Main takeaway is they guided Q3 revenue lower than expected. They said Q3 revenue would come in at $8.52 billion. That's below expectations of $8.67 billion. And it comes after revenue also missed estimates in the quarter. But you're seeing earnings per share, a significant beat there.\n\nI also want to call out a few other notable beats here in terms of profitability. We had operating margin and free cash flow steadily beat those expectations. Operating margin hitting 22.3% in the quarter. That's well ahead of Netflix's own projection of 19%. Also, free cash flow, the expectation there was $542 million. It came in at $1.34 billion. And Netflix also raised its full year outlook for free cash flow to $5 billion on the heels of that double writers strike, which we have been hearing from analysts.\n\nSo interesting that the strike is not hurting Netflix. In fact, it's boosting Netflix a little bit.\n\nJOSH SCHAFER: Also interesting in the overall context of the streaming conversation we keep having, and we keep talking about profitability, right, and how these companies need to be profitable. And now, the only streaming company that is profitable just showed a lot of metrics about being more profitable and increasing in that sign. And now, they're getting hit, because the top line isn't doing well.\n\nAt some point, what is it? To some extent, it seems like a little bit.\n\nALEXANDRA CANAL: And look, I mean, the expectations were so high heading into this report. There was a ton of bullish sentiment. We kept getting analyst upgrades. We kept getting price target boosts. I was a little surprised to see that we didn't have a double beat just because of how many notes I read that said they would significantly beat on all of these metrics. And now that we got one that missed expectations, investors are punishing the company, so to speak.\n\nPRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah, may be a case of, you know, too high expectations going into this report. I was surprised to see that strong or subscriber growth numbers. I guess seeing the password stuff kind of feeling that bite there on a positive trend for Netflix. Also funny, interesting they note that the writer's strike stuff. Is it because they're not going to be paying out some of these fees that they're eiher increasing that limit there, is that part of the reason why?\n\nALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah. That's part of it, just not having to spend so much on content, because there's no content to be created to buy with the actors on strike, and the writers also on strike. You mentioned subscribers, 5.89 million net additions. The expectation there was for roughly 2 million. So--\n\nPRAS SUBRAMANIAN: It's huge, yeah.\n\nALEXANDRA CANAL: Huge jump there. And if you remember about a year ago, we lost a million subscribers. So for Netflix, this I think is really good momentum heading in to the back half of this year. I'm very curious to see what executives are going to say on the call, right, especially in regards to the strike, because I do think we get a lot of context and a lot more color on the call to these numbers. And I think that could potentially change the share price here.\n\nPRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah. And just, Josh, I'm like, profitability. It's a pretty profitable business. I mean, over 20% operating margins? Like, that's great. You would be very happy to have that. But maybe there's this whole sell the news a bit here after a nice run-up. I think that's part of it.\n\nJOSH SCHAFER: That's what I was going to say. I mean, I think that's going to be a story of this earnings season, when you think about a lot of what's been caught up in this rally, right? And Netflix has had a good year. I'm not saying that they got caught up in the AI rally. And that's why it's up 70%.\n\nBut the stock's up 70%. At some point, stocks don't just go up forever on good metrics. Those metrics were already sort of priced into the stock. You're seeing it teeter a little bit now before the call. And then you see what it does over the next six months right. You're not necessarily always going to have these big beats, big jumps like we saw in the first quarter when it came to some of those companies when they talked about AI or when Netflix has had these bonuses from talking about the ad growth and things like that in the past. I think you're sort of seeing a little bit more muted, because it's already priced into the stock to some extent.\n\nALEXANDRA CANAL: Yes. And Josh, I think you wrote about this, too, that the theme of this earnings season as well will be unless these companies significantly beat, you're not going to see much change in the stock price, because we do have an overheated market right now.\n\nJOSH SCHAFER: And let's talk about another stock, Pras. It's been a little hot. We got Tesla up over 100% to start the year. Now, on earnings, really not moving too much. I mean, what was the main takeaway?\n\nPRAS SUBRAMANIAN: So first of all, I want to say in relation to also Netflix, too, is that we're talking about after-hours trading here. So it's very light, it's very sort of volatile. Wait till tomorrow to see what's going to happen. But right now, Tesla shares basically flat, which is kind of a surprise for Tesla.\n\nBut I want to note that strong earnings revenue beat here. Revenue up to almost $25 billion, right? That's up 46% from a year ago. So a strong revenue there, but what's causing it? Those price cuts fueling those additional sales. So a margin miss here, 18.2% margins missing, estimates there.\n\nOperating margins came in at 9.6%, Allie. Compare that to Netflix, right? And that's the first time it's dipped below 10 in a long time, almost 500 basis points lower than a year ago. So really seeing that margin issue here. Hopefully, we hear-- for Tesla investors, hopefully, we hear about, hey, this is the trough of our margin kind of season here. Hopefully, they're going to pick up slightly. We'll see what they say. But they didn't indicate that this is the end of margin sort of slippage.\n\nJOSH SCHAFER: That to me Is part of probably why you're seeing Tesla stock not move that much right now, right? Because they didn't actually-- they don't put out guidance for that margin in that release that you were just going through. So you don't really have any insight into if it is trough. A lot of analysts have called for it to be the bottom of that margin decline that we've seen over the last couple of quarters. Until you actually know, until Elon comes on tonight, and hopefully, for Tesla investors, says this is as low as the margin is going to get. We think we're going to get back up now. Then you probably see the stock pop or at least that's what people are looking for, right?\n\nAlso, another interesting part of what you were reading that I thought is just standout about Tesla and how it normally moves after earnings, so Tesla's beat on adjusted EPS, eight of the last 10 quarter, the stock's fallen six of those times now. And that's normally a metric that sometimes you move up on, right? So it hasn't necessarily been a driver for Tesla to the upside even when they do beat on.\n\nPRAS SUBRAMANIAN: It's never been about the earnings, right? It's been about the other stuff-- the margins, the cyber--\n\nJOSH SCHAFER: What would you say about the Cybertruck?\n\nALEXANDRA CANAL: Netflix, too. Netflix, too. I mean, earnings steadily beat. But that's not enough. The stock's down 5%.\n\nPRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Cybertruck on track for production and also initial deliveries later this year is what they said. So we'll see if that means Q3 or Q4. Elon Musk said last quarter, Q3, end of Q3 was the delivery event slated to be scheduled. We'll see if that happens. So we'll hear about that in a little bit.\n\nALEXANDRA CANAL: So what do you think the margin decline and the margin miss was on? Was it from those price hikes and the pricing war that we're seeing?\n\nPRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah. The price cuts, yeah, for sure, for sure.\n\nALEXANDRA CANAL: The price cuts, yes.\n\nPRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah. They haven't been able to improve scale and potentially component pricing enough to overcompensate for that. Those price cuts, maybe we'll hear a bit more about in the call, like, hey, actually, what we're seeing that improve, we're actually build more cars cheaper. Parts are cheaper. We're actually going to start seeing the higher-- higher profit margins here despite low prices. So that's the kind of goal that I think people want to hear about.\n\nALEXANDRA CANAL: Interesting that the price cuts could boost revenue but then--\n\nPRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah. Yeah, totally.\n\nALEXANDRA CANAL: --hurt margins In that way.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/video/netflix-stock-falls-despite-big-213717459.html", "symbols": ["NFC.F", "NFC.XETRA", "NFLX.MX", "NFLX.US", "NFLX34.SA", "TL0.F", "TL0.XETRA", "TSLA.MX", "TSLA.US", "TSLA34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 1, "neg": 0.041, "neu": 0.808, "pos": 0.151}}, {"date": "2023-07-19T21:35:06+00:00", "title": "Tesla (TSLA) Beats Q2 Earnings and Revenue Estimates", "content": "Tesla (TSLA) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.91 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.83 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.76 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 9.64%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this electric car maker would post earnings of $0.83 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.85, delivering a surprise of 2.41%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nTesla , which belongs to the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, posted revenues of $24.93 billion for the quarter ended June 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.17%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $16.93 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nTesla shares have added about 138.1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 18.6%.\n\nWhat's Next for Tesla?\n\nWhile Tesla has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Tesla: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.86 on $25.62 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $3.54 on $100.61 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Automotive - Domestic is currently in the top 16% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nPolaris Inc (PII), another stock in the same industry, has yet to report results for the quarter ended June 2023. The results are expected to be released on July 25.\n\nThis snowmobile and ATV maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.13 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -12%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nPolaris Inc's revenues are expected to be $2.16 billion, up 4.5% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Sales jumped and the company beat analyst expectations for net income in the April-June quarter, although the company's profit margins declined. Tesla shares followed suit in after-hours trading.\n\nThe Austin, Texas, maker of electric vehicles, solar panels and batteries reported net income of $2.7 billion in the quarter, a 20% increase from a year ago. Earnings per share also rose 20% to 78 cents when measured via generally accepted accounting principles. Total revenue rose 47% to $24.93 billion.\n\nAnalysts, however, tend to focus on Tesla's own measurement of profit, which excludes stock-based compensation expense. By that measure, Tesla's net income zoomed to $3.15 billion, or 91 cents a share, sharply exceeding average analyst estimates of 80 cents per share according to FactSet. Some analysts had expected profits to fall because of the price cuts.\n\nTesla shares, however, initially stayed flat at roughly $292 in after-hours trading immediately following the earnings report, up a smidgeon from their close at $291.26. As Tesla executives spoke to analysts in a conference call, shares slipped more than 4%.\n\nTesla reported strong vehicle delivery numbers on July 2, saying they rose 83% compared to the year-earlier quarter after the company cut prices several times on its four electric vehicle models. Tesla sold a record 466,140 vehicles worldwide from April through June, nearly double the 254,695 it sold during the same period a year earlier.\n\nThe vast majority of those sales involved Tesla\u2019s popular Model 3 sedans and Model Y crossover SUVs.\n\nBut the earnings report provided mixed messages on one of the larger questions facing Tesla: whether the automaker\u2019s discounting strategy can boost sales while preserving its profit margins. Tesla's operating margin, which represents how efficiently sales are turned into pretax profits, fell to 9.6% in the April-June quarter, down significantly from 14.6% a year earlier. The measure had also declined sharply in the January-March quarter.\n\nIn the company's conference call with analysts, Musk praised the company's performance despite high interest rates and what he called significant economic uncertainty, then quickly changed the subject to Tesla's advanced projects such as its so-called \u201cfull self driving\u201d software. Despite the name, Tesla cars with the software enabled cannot drive themselves, and the company warns drivers that they have to be ready to intervene at all times.\n\nMusk also said that Tesla should deliver its long promised Cybertruck \u2014 an unusual looking pickup truck with an angular design \u2014 by the end of the year.\n\nWhile pressures on profitability and pricing continue to weigh on Tesla, Jeff Windau, an analyst with Edward Jones, said he took heart from some management comments about cost control and said the company's overall trajectory remains sound.\n\n\u201cThe long term drivers for growth remain in place and there are just going to be some near-term headwinds in the current environment we're in,\u201d he said.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/teslas-q2-income-jumps-20-204051315.html", "symbols": ["TL0.F", "TL0.XETRA", "TSLA.MX", "TSLA.US", "TSLA34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.994, "neg": 0.032, "neu": 0.839, "pos": 0.129}}, {"date": "2023-07-19T20:34:00+00:00", "title": "Tesla Just Rolled Out a Big New Update Its Customers Will Love", "content": "Tesla has had a powerful run-up to the earnings the company will report after the bell Wednesday.

So earnings beating estimates, Seana, here by 10 centimeters, but the market could absolutely care less. You're seeing a little bit of a reversal. Shares in Tesla now trading lower on these numbers. Why? We talked about it coming into this report, and it's good to see investors focusing on this. This is gross profit margin. 18.2% missing consensus forecast of 18.8%.\n\nAnd then oh yeah, guess what? Down almost 700 bips or basis points year over year and the market is not liking that. Why? Because it tells you these price cuts that Tesla has led in the marketplace with has put pressure on Ford and GM to follow suit. These price cuts are weighing on Tesla's profit margins and the Street might be too high in its earnings estimates for the balance of this year and probably 2024. And hey, who knows, Seana? Maybe 2025.\n\nSEANA SMITH: And so has the pressure was on Tesla headed into these results because of the massive run up that we've seen in shares since the start of the year. We're talking a gain just about 140% since January 1st. The pressure on margins-- that was the number one thing to watch. We know we heard from Tesla's CFO, at the start of this year, talking about that 20% goal here for gross margins. Once again Tesla below that at 18.2%. A bigger drop than the Street was expecting to see.\n\nThat could be a massive headwind here for Tesla, at least in the short-term. And those pricing wars doesn't seem to be letting up any time soon. Earlier this week, Ford cutting the price of its lightning electric pickup truck here adding to some of that competition that we are seeing here within the EV space. Tesla coming out with its Cybertruck, producing its first Cybertruck over the weekend. You got to think that maybe we will see more price cuts here in the future, given the fact that they need to do something to increase demand.\n\n- Right on. And far be it for me to instantly poo, poo this quarter from Tesla before its earnings call. But going-- when you're going through this earnings release from Tesla, scroll down to the profitability explanation. You'll see on the third bullet point, increase in operating expenses driven by Cybertruck AI and other large projects. I think investors have totally forgot to make money in the future, you need to invest money today.\n\nAnd I think you're now starting to see some of these investments, the Cybertruck, is not free to produce. Creating AI tools is not free to produce. Is going to weigh on Tesla's profit margins as it's lowering prices. To me, that's not a great combination, but what do I know?\n\nSEANA SMITH: We take a look again at the headline numbers despite that operating margin miss here. Revenue 24.9 billion coming in ahead of the Street's expectations. Also a beat there on EPS-- adjusted EPS, $0.91.

That revenue figure represents a slight gain from Q1 and a gain of over 45% from a year ago.\n\nOn the profitability end, Tesla reported adjusted net income of $3.1 billion, compared to estimates of $2.87 billion and more than the $2.9 billion adjusted net income from Q1.\n\nTesla's closely watched Q2 gross margin came in at 18.2%, below analyst expectations of 18.8%. In Q1, Tesla's gross margin was 19.3%, which was down from Q4\u2019s 24%.

Musk also disclosed the company is in early discussions with a \"major OEM\" regarding licensing full-self driving (FSD) software.\n\nOver the last three months, Tesla stock has jumped a whopping 58%, adding over $100 to its share price for investors riding the boom. Charging deals with legacy automakers, a massive run-up in AI-related stocks that roped Tesla in, and strong production and delivery numbers for Q2 pulled Tesla stock higher and led to analyst after analyst pulling their price targets higher. This weekend\u2019s news that Giga Austin built its first production Cybertruck gave the stock a boost on Monday.\n\nEarlier this month Tesla reported Q2 global production of 479,700 units, with deliveries of 466,140. The delivery figure easily topped Wall Street consensus estimates of 448,599 units as well as the prior quarter\u2019s total of 422,875. Both production and delivery totals for the second quarter were all-time records for Tesla.\n\nThis story is developing.\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

The market for electric vehicles (EVs) has rapidly grown in the past few years, and despite the slowdown in 2022, the market has picked up better than anticipated this year. There is a strong acceleration in EV adoption but it will also depend on the government policies and the manufacturing companies. EV manufacturing companies could have their best years coming ahead and now is the time for investing in EV stocks. Whether you believe in the future of electric vehicles or not, investing in EV stocks will help turn $1,000 into $1 million.\n\nThe electric vehicle landscape is rapidly changing, and new players are entering the market while some are unable to keep pace with the thriving industry. If you are thinking about investing in the EV industry, you need to look for companies that have proven themselves, and ones that have the necessary talent, tech and liquidity to be the best in this industry. Here are the top EV stocks to buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) on stock market. Tesla financial success and profit.\n\nSource: Rokas Tenys / Shutterstock.com\n\nUndoubtedly one of the best EV stocks to buy, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has ruled the industry for a few years now. Investors who have owned the stock in the past decade have taken home massive gains. TSLA stock is up 168% year to date and is trading at $290 today. The stock was at $108 in January and is inching closer to $300 presently. There are multiple reasons to own Tesla stock. One is its competitive advantage. When it comes to EVs and self-driving technology, nobody has been able to beat Tesla.\n\nConsidered a leader in the industry, the company is a solid brand that offers investors strong gross margins. It reported impressive delivery numbers, which is proof that consumers are willing to pay a premium for a luxury product. The company delivered 466,140 cars in the second quarter. It is planning to build a factory in India, which could be a strong move considering the population of the country. Tesla is known for offering the longest range in EVs and the company\u2019s vehicles have some of the coolest features which customers love.\n\nAnother reason to love this stock is its leadership and experience. The company has established itself in the market, and enjoys an early-mover advantage. Elon Musk does not shy away from innovation, and using the latest technology to improve the performance of the company\u2019s EVs. The company has also generated a new source of revenue by offering its charging network to other EV companies. While it may not make a huge contribution to the total revenue, it will make a difference. The company is set to report quarterly results on soon which it might take the stock even higher.\n\nFord Motor Company (F) Ford logo badge on grill of car\n\nSource: JuliusKielaitis / Shutterstock.com\n\nNot a lot of people are a fan of Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), but I believe in the company\u2019s ability to scale production and inch higher. In the first quarter, the company reported net sales of $41.5 billion which was up 20% year over year, and the EPS was up 66% year over year. These numbers prove that a lot is coming up from the company. Ford\u2019s EV division sold 12,000 units in the recent quarter, which was a drop from the previous quarter. However, its quarterly sales in the United states were up 9.9% resulting in 531,662 vehicles sold. The management is certain that they can hit the goal of 2 million annually by the end of 2026. It recently partnered with Tesla for the charging infrastructure, and Ford owners will now be able to charge their vehicles at Tesla\u2019s charging stations.\n\nWhen we look at Ford, we must remember its position as one of the top automakers, and the company has the potential to become a big player in the EV space in the coming years. F stock is trading at $14 today and is moving closer to the 52-week high of $16. The stock is up 20% year to date, and I believe this upward momentum will continue. It also enjoys a dividend yield of 4.01% and has paid a quarterly dividend of $0.15.\n\nFord is a strong brand but a lot will depend on how it handles the competition in the EV space. However, if you believe in the future of EVs and understand the risks associated with the company, Ford can be a good buy. Citi has recently raised the price target of the stock to $17 with a buy rating. The company is set to report earnings soon.\n\nLi Auto (LI) Li Auto electric car in store. Li Auto Also known as Li Xiang, is a Chinese electric vehicle (EV) company\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nLi Auto (NASDAQ:LI) is one of the high potential EV stocks that can help turn your $1,000 into a $1 million. While it may take time to see massive growth in the company, it is already on its way there. LI stock is trading at $38 today and is up 82% year to date. It has soared above 79% in the last six months. The company is planning to launch new models this year, and it has already surpassed this quarter\u2019s production expectations.\n\nIt delivered 52,584 vehicles in the first quarter and 86,533 vehicles in the second quarter. The company had projected deliveries in the range of 76,000 to 80,000 vehicles for the quarter, but delivered more than that. This will also reflect in the top and bottom lines when the company reports results. For perspective, in the first quarter, the company reported a revenue of $2.74 billion, which is a 96% rise from the same quarter the previous year, and its gross profit hit $557.7 million, a 77% rise.\n\nLi Auto is well-placed in China, and is leading the market there. The current situation of the economy points to a more positive Chinese market and the demand for EVs could go higher. This will lead to a rise in sales and revenues for Li Auto. Looking at the company\u2019s potential, LI stock looks undervalued to me. The automaker has a longer runway for growth and it offers a solid investment opportunity for investors looking to grow their money.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Just yesterday, Ford released news on price cuts to the F-150 Lighting pickup by nearly $10,000-A decrease of up to 16%.\n\nPrice Cut Factors\n\nFord credits an increase in production and decreased raw material costs for their price drops. Elon Musk, however, cited a goal of selling more vehicles at lower prices as Tesla shifts focus toward service, software and its full self-driving system. Tesla also seems to be leveraging its market advantage as an EV price leader to constrict emerging competition.\n\nThe growing inventory of EVs at the nation\u2019s dealerships is a contributing factor as well. By the end of June, Most electric car models closed at over 100 days\u2019 supply compared to 38 days\u2019 supply for gas-powered cars.\n\nWhy Aren\u2019t People Buying?\n\nAlthough the Federal Government incentivizes new EV buyers with a $7,500 tax credit, many consumers still can\u2019t fit the cost into their budget. In a June Survey by Cox Automotive, 51% of consumers were considering an electric vehicle \u2014 up from 2021\u2019s survey results of 38%.\n\nIf record numbers of consumers want an EV for their next car, then why are these cars stuck on the lot? Tax credits aside, 43% of surveyed consumers reported affordability as the main barrier to buying.\n\nThe average transaction price (how much it sold for) for an EV was $53,438 in June compared to an average of $48,808 for gas-powered cars according to Kelley Blue Book. That\u2019s a 20% drop from last year\u2019s average. Even with prices on the decline, the cost of buying an electric car is more closely aligned with the price of luxury gas-powered vehicles.\n\nDiscover: 9 Best Hybrid Cars Under $30K If You\u2019re Unable To Go Fully Electric Learn: 8 Electric Cars You May Regret Buying\n\nElectric vehicles are highly desired by most consumers, but the luxury price point still scares off potential mid-phase EV adopters.

The\u00a0sales slowdown came as\u00a0GM\u00a0focused on developing new EV models on its flexible\u00a0Ultium platform\u00a0that is designed to optimize production, once supply chain issues are resolved.\u00a0The first EV\u00a0that got off the platform, the GMC Hummer EV, experienced low sales in\u00a0the first two quarters of the year with an 83% decline compared to 2022\u2019s figures.\n\nEV troubles are mounting up as on July 18th,\u00a0GM\u2019s\u00a0CAMI Assembly electric vehicle plant in Ingersoll, Ontario has reportedly closed for the month unexpectedly\u00a0due to a\u00a0battery shortage, according to The London Free Press.\u00a0Currently, GM only produces Ultium batteries at the Ultium Cells plant in Lordstown, Ohio\u00a0with plans to build\u00a0a second plant in Tennessee in 2024 and a third in Michigan in 2025.\n\nGM expects to leave behind these challenges soon as it plans to launch three new high-volume Ultium EVs from Chevrolet by the end of the year, namely the Silverado EV, Equinox EV, and Blazer EV. GM\u2019s Ramos Arizpe plant in Mexico stated that first Chevy Blazer EV is on its way to the US.\n\nWhile GM executives are confident in increasing EV production this year, the automaker\u2019s history of unfulfilled promises leaves plenty of space for concern. However, GM is actively expanding its battery capacity, which according to CEO Mary Barra is the main bottleneck, but it will take time to reach optimal production levels.\n\nFord Announces Significant Price Cuts\n\nOn Monday, Ford intensified the EV price war in the U.S. with price cuts for its flagship electric pickup, the electric version of America\u2019s most beloved pickup, F-150.Ford announced that seven F-150 Lightning models will be discounted by 6 to 17%. Back when Tesla began the price war by slashing its vehicle prices by $13,000 at the beginning of the year, Ford responded by cutting prices for its electric SUV, the Mustang Mach-E, but then Tesla discounted its Model S and Model X vehicles in March.\n\nAlso on Monday, Ford cited that the discounted pricing is the result of its increased plant capacity at its Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Michigan, a lower cost of raw materials and batteries with benefits of scaled production. The Rouge plant is currently closed for final plant upgrades as the Blue Oval plans to triple its annual F-150 Lightning production rate to 150,000 as of this autumn. Tesla\u2019s price war which resulted in Ford\u2019s and GM\u2019s discounting of prices resulted in higher sales for all three carmakers. Tesla led with a 466,000 EVs in its April to June quarter, with Ford selling almost 15,000 EVs in the April to June quarter and GM doubling its EV sales that exceeded 15,000. Moreover, F-150 Lightning sales skyrocketed 119% compared to 2022\u2019s comparable quarter and therefore, the latest move is likely to intended to keep up the strong momentum.\n\nChina Remains Way Ahead Of The U.S. When It Comes To EVs\n\nThough local EV brands are dominating the world\u2019s greatest EV market, General Motors and Volkswagen (OTC: VWAGY) are fighting for their piece of the pie in China with Tesla certainly making it even harder with its Shanghai factory. But even Tesla is not the EV king in China as the industry leader is BYD \u2014 a Shenzhen-based Warren Buffet-back company whose name stands for \u201cBuild Your Dreams,\u201d is by all means the world\u2019s biggest EV seller, including hybrids.\u00a0On the back of an antitrust law, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, a pledge made this month by Tesla and 15 other automakers to avoid abnormal pricing was retracted. So even Tesla does not have a clear path ahead in China. China is also a clear leader in EV batteries as Ford Motor CEO\u00a0Jim Farley\u00a0emphasized during the Morgan Stanley\u2019s sustainable finance summit in May, with the automaker\u2019s biggest rival not being GM or Toyota Motor (NYSE: TM) but Chinese EV makers such as BYD, with the country itself being a threat with its dominance in raw materials supply such as lithium and the supply chain.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

Nasdaq Global Markets reporter Jill Malandrino notes that the second-quarter earnings season is \"off to a strong start.\" Malandrino explains that investors are now looking to Big Tech earnings to continue the rally. The market will be looking at the extent to which \"artificial intelligence will dominate these firms' forward-looking guidance.\"\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n[VIDEO LOGO]\n\n- The Dow poised to hit an eight-day winning streak as stocks gain on strong bank earnings. For more on what we can expect this earnings season is Jill Malandrino, Nasdaq Global markets reporter. Hey, Jill.\n\nJILL MALANDRINO: Hey. How's it going? In second quarter, earnings season is off to a strong start. Of the companies in the S&P 500 that have reported results, 82% have exceeded expectations, according to FactSet data. For many investors, the recent streak of gains bolsters the case for a soft landing scenario. It's an outlook that has gained traction after last week's encouraging inflation data in recent jobs data that suggests the labor market is cooling a bit.\n\nLooking ahead, analysts still expect earnings growth for the second half of 2023. For the third quarter and fourth quarter, analysts are projecting earnings growth of 1/10 of a percent and 7.6% respectively. For all of 2023, analysts predict earnings growth of 6/10 of a percent.\n\nInvestors are now shifting their focus to earnings from big tech companies as their performance has been fueled by lofty expectations. The market will be eyeing, not if, but to what extent artificial intelligence will dominate these firms' forward-looking guidance. Generative AI may not have boosted second quarter figures, but it may very well expand this quarter's product offerings and available target markets.\n\nWedbush analysts believe that a new tech bull market is taking shape, propelled by the AI revolution. They predict an above average second quarter earnings season for the tech sector in the coming weeks. Wedbush also sees enterprise it budgets showing signs of improvement in the June quarter, with AI spending becoming a reality and not just type.\n\n- Jill, I want to switch gears for a second and talk housing. The number of available homes for sale hit the lowest level ever last month, and that's according to Zillow. What can we expect for the housing market in the second half of this year?\n\nJILL MALANDRINO: Well, it's a supply story. It's simply what it is. US single-family housing starts, which account for the bulk of homebuilding dropped 7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 935,000 after surging in the prior month. But permits for future construction increased solidly as a severe shortage of previously-owned house sales supports new construction.\n\nNow, housing supply remains well below pre-pandemic levels, driving groundbreaking on new projects. A survey on Tuesday showed the national association of homebuilders Wells Fargo housing market index increased to a 13-month high in July to 56, with fewer builders reporting offering incentives to attract buyers. A reading above 50 is considered a positive sentiment.\n\nBuilders say low supply in the resale market is driving demand for new construction, but higher mortgage rates and supply side challenges continue to put pressure on the overall market. The average rate on the popular 30-year fixed mortgage crossed over 7% briefly in May. And then again, at the end of June, it's only come down slightly in the last week. Those higher rates are straining affordability in the market where prices for existing homes are rising. Yet again, due to inventory constraints, making it difficult for people to enter the market, especially first-time buyers.\n\nAccording to KPMG, roughly half as many homes for sale as there were in 2019, and even fewer listed for 300,000 or lower. It's also important to note that a majority of homeowners are locked into sub 4% mortgage rates and they're unlikely to list homes unless there's a life event forcing them to do so. So again, more supply constraint concerns.\n\n- That's right. If you got that 3% or 4% mortgage, sit on it. You're doing yourself a favor. Thank you for that, Jill Malandrino.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/video/investors-shift-focus-big-tech-162130424.html", "symbols": ["NFC.F", "NFC.XETRA", "NFLX.MX", "NFLX.US", "NFLX34.SA", "TL0.F", "TL0.XETRA", "TSLA.MX", "TSLA.US", "TSLA34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.994, "neg": 0.041, "neu": 0.84, "pos": 0.12}}, {"date": "2023-07-19T16:16:30+00:00", "title": "S&amp;P 500 in 'terrific uptrend' as sectors reach record-highs: Analyst", "content": "The SPY Index is showing S&P 500 stocks to be on an upswing as sectors climb to new highs.

From there, the company plans on opening its first major facility in Nevada.\n\nRedwood Materials, founded in 2017, has the goal of acting as the missing link in the battery sustainability cycle. By reusing materials used in the batteries that are now ubiquitous in almost all major consumer products, including EVs, the company looks to reduce the need for mineral mining.\n\nThe Epoch Times\u00a0wrote back in 2022 that the current uptick in EV adoption and increased demand for lithium batteries presents a significant environmental challenge.\n\n\u201cAs demand for lithium increases and production is tapped from deeper rock mines and brines, the challenges of mitigating environmental risk will increase.\u201d\n\nWe\u00a0also wrote about the \"subhuman\" and \"appalling\" cobalt mining that takes place in the Congo to mine battery minerals. Siddharth Kara, who is a Harvard visiting professor and also the author of \u201cCobalt Red: How The Blood of The Congo Powers Our Lives\" took to The Joe Rogan Podcast in late 2022 with comments.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen [a cobalt mine that did not rely on child labor or slavery] and I\u2019ve been to almost all the major industrial cobalt mines,\" he told Rogan.\n\nStraubel's company has backers that include T Rowe Price, Baillie Gifford and Fidelity already. Redwood is looking to close on $700 million in its latest round of financing. It previously closed on $700 million in financing at a $3.7 billion valuation in 2021, the report says. It has also secured $2 billion in loans from the US Department of Energy.\n\nRedwood plans for its plant to support the production of more than 1 million vehicles a year. The timing could not be better: President Joe Biden is working to make half of all new vehicles sold electric by 2030.\n\nIt plans for a second plant on 600 acres near Charleston, South Carolina, the report adds.\n\nStraubel helped co-found Tesla in 2003 and stayed on with CEO Elon Musk for over 15 years. His presence became a staple at all Tesla events and most Tesla conference calls. He has since joined Tesla's Board of Directors.\n\nBy Zerohedge.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:\n\nAsia Slashes Russian LNG Imports To Two-Year Low New Study: Leaky Infrastructure Could Make Gas As \u2018Dirty\u2019 As Coal Food Security At Risk As Russia And Ukraine Seek Alternatives To Grain Deal\n\nRead this article on OilPrice.com", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ex-tesla-exec-secures-5-160000638.html", "symbols": ["TL0.F", "TL0.XETRA", "TSLA.MX", "TSLA.US", "TSLA34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.558, "neg": 0.035, "neu": 0.921, "pos": 0.044}}, {"date": "2023-07-19T15:58:00+00:00", "title": "North America Owners of These Electric Vehicles Just Got Great News", "content": "Of course, Willis's classic line from the 1988 action epic \"Die Hard\" saw his John McClane character toss a body out a high-rise window as he took on terrorists.

I have several data graphics and analyst commentaries to share that you don't want to miss.\r\n\r\nAnd I explain the math that made me turn from rational skeptic to curious investor.\r\n\r\nTesla Skeptic Learns Algebra (TSLA)\r\n\r\nI start out explaining why two years ago I picked the Ford F F-150 Lightning to be a solid winner over the Cybertruck. You can review that article and video here...\r\n\r\nThe F-150 Lightning Will Crush the Tesla Cybertruck\r\n\r\nWe made over 80% on Ford shares on that thesis in my TAZR Trader portfolio last year.\r\n\r\nBut on Monday, all that changed when Ford had to capitulate and lower their prices. They said it was to pass on their cost savings to customers.\r\n\r\nYet with Lightning trucks sitting on dealer lots over 90 days and the Cybertruck about to go into full production -- with possibly 1.5 million \"reservation\" pre-orders -- Wall Street smells a bluff.\r\n\r\nSo, on Monday I sold my Ford F shares that we bought near $12... and I bought Tesla. Here was my quick rationale...\r\n\r\nBUYING Tesla between $280 and $290. That's right, this Tesla skeptic has seen the light.\r\n\r\nAnd it might mark a short-term top ahead of earnings on Wednesday, but I think the stock is headed to challenge the 52-week highs at $310-315 very soon.\r\n\r\nI'll have more research this week on why I am suddenly a TSLA bull, but I'll quickly summarize the argument thus...\r\n\r\n1. Massive economies of scale and vertical integration that other EV mfgs can't compete with = best and cheapest EVs\n\n2. EV adoption accelerates as both cost-per-mile and environmental impact are winning\n\n3. Sales of Model Y are much stronger globally than I previously understood, and Model 3's are EVERYWHERE between Chicago, Milwaukee and Madison.\n\n4. Momentum continues to go their way with $7500 tax credit going up-front next year\n\n5. Nothing to do with Cybertruck orders... and everything to do with them as The BRAND dominates\r\n\r\n(end of Monday \"buy rationale\" for TSLA)\r\n\r\nWhat I didn't talk about yet is Tesla's relentless innovation with manufacturing elements like the GigaPress, FSD (Full Self-Driving), and bringing battery manufacturing in-house with the 4680 designs.\r\n\r\nI'll be doing that later today for a Zacks Strategy Session with our in-house team of analysts.\r\n\r\nUntil then, watch today's video even if you are finding this after Tesla has reported earnings because if the stock is lower on some disappointment in the outlook, I will give you plenty of reasons to consider buying some shares on any drop towards $250.\r\n\r\nAnd for those interested in my F-150 \"Crush\" thesis, here was my more detailed rationale for buying Ford, of which I am still a long-term fan...\r\n\r\nI was a big fan of the F150 Lightning roll-out in 2021 for several reasons that still stand...\r\n\r\n1. Work-truck innovations like outlets to power tools, plus a new world of EV acceleration and power-towing.\r\n\r\n2. Embedded software intelligence features for range calculation with varying loads and tow-hitch assist.\r\n\r\n3. The global EV vision of CEO Jim Farley\r\n\r\nHere's how I summed up the picture in July of 2021 in the vlog The F-150 Lightning Will Crush the Tesla Cybertruck...\r\n\r\nThe New F-150 Lightning: Pickup Truck Becomes Tech Platform\r\n\r\nSo why do I think the F-150 Lightning will clobber the Tesla Cybertruck? Because as much as the cyber thing is a luxury toy with low practical usage (or at least low visibility in terms of recognized practicality), the F-150 Lightning is the complete opposite.\r\n\r\nIn the tradition of the world's top selling vehicle, it's a workhorse that just got a huge upgrade of technology, features, and connected intelligence.\r\n\r\nWe're talking about 10,000-pound max towing capacity, 775 pound-feet of torque, up to 300 miles of range, zero-to-60 in 4.5 seconds, onboard electric power for your work tools and adventure toys with 11 outlets, 9.6kW of backup to \"off-board\" and power your house up to 3 days, and fully-connected vehicle intelligence for range, load, and charging calculations as well as mobile software updates.\r\n\r\nAnd the cab has the beautiful control touchscreen like the Mustang Mach-E -- plus options to lower the gear selector lever and roll-out a big laptop workspace from the elbow rest! I've got a big fat 2015 Chevy Suburban that has no room for me to do anything near that (you're starting to see how I love this truck). Did I mention the FordPass Charging network and app?\r\n\r\nObviously the features and $40,000 base-price increase as one ascends into the Ford Pro levels, designed specifically with trade contractors and commercial fleets in mind.\r\n\r\nI think that the primary customers of F-150s are going to find these upgrades especially attractive. Those primary, and tough, customers are contractors and other business owners who need a reliable, stylish workhorse every day of the week. Once this group adopts the benefits of a familiar truck turned EV, they are going to be very influential on those around them.\r\n\r\n(end of excerpt from my July '21 vlog)\r\n\r\nBottom line: I want both Tesla and Ford to win and I think they both will dominate, in their own ways, this decade.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Jung\u2019s report pulls historical data on the total number of new Tesla vehicle listings (Model S, 3, X, Y) available in the US on Tesla\u2019s website.\n\nIt now seems the trend of decreasing inventories has reversed itself. After Jung\u2019s data showed a dip in inventory to a low of 846 on June 26, a subsequent large build-up followed, hitting 2,757 by July 19. A large buildup in inventory suggests Tesla is upping its production volumes or is having a harder time selling new inventory. Tesla US inventory data broken down by model (credit: Matt Jung)\n\nWith July being the start of the new quarter, Tesla doesn\u2019t necessarily offer incentives or sales tools of that nature to move inventory as the company would at the end of the quarter, but nonetheless the build in new vehicle stock is notable. Looking across the product offerings, from early June until mid-July the biggest builds in inventory appear to be of the more expensive Model X and Model S vehicles, but unsold stock of the cheaper Model 3 and Model Y is rising as well.\n\nConversely, and perhaps not surprisingly, another data source that tracks Tesla\u2019s order backlog is showing a similar trend. Tesla sales tracker Troy Teslike (as first noted by InsideEVs) finds that Tesla\u2019s global order backlog fell to around 49,000 units as of June 30, which is around 17% less than what it was two weeks ago, and over 50% smaller than the 102K backlog seen on May 31. Tesla's global order backlog (credit: Troy Teslike)\n\nTeslike\u2019s numbers are based on \u201cTesla-related stats (production volume, average wait times for each model/trim)\u201d that the site has been collecting for several years. The numbers suggest Tesla\u2019s US order backlog stood at 11 days at the end of June, a dramatic decrease from the 27 days noted in mid-May. The order backlog in days relates to the wait time a customer can expect when placing a new, custom order.\n\nRising inventories and decreasing backlog of orders signal the effect of Tesla\u2019s deep price cuts combined with federal EV tax credits that fueled the company\u2019s Q2 deliveries beat, may be waning as Q3 begins. With Tesla expected to report earnings after the bell on Wednesday, there had been expectations on the part of Wall Street analysts that the company would hit its margin \u201ctrough\u201d in Q2, and that the effects of lower component costs and improvements in manufacturing scale would offset the price cuts from earlier in the year.\n\nWith demand seeming to slip, however, Tesla may have to resort to more price cuts to gin up demand or decrease output. With Tesla stock soaring of late, investors and analysts will be anxiously awaiting what Tesla and its CEO Elon Musk will have to say about this following the release of Q2 earnings.\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Second-quarter results may force a rethink.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTesla Investor Rode a 14,800% Gain Thanks to 27-Year-Old Analyst Singapore Passport Is World\u2019s Most Powerful, Replacing Japan A $500 Billion Corporate-Debt Storm Builds Over Global Economy Rags-to-Riches Wealth Fund Veteran Plans to Run for Singapore President Meet the Billionaire Who Convinced Messi to Pick MLS Over Saudi Arabia\n\nWhen the electric vehicle-maker reports earnings on Wednesday, Wall Street analysts are expecting its automotive gross margin to come in at around 20%, according to the average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That would be a drop from around 28% in the same period a year ago.\n\nDramatic price cuts on its vehicles have helped boost sales for Tesla but have weighed on profitability. With the stock trading at 70 times forward earnings \u2014 compared to around 5.8 times for General Motors Co. and about 8 times for Ford Motor Co. \u2014 Tesla faces scrutiny as to how it can maintain the lead in a market of slowing sales and rising inventories.\n\n\u201cMargin improvement is key for the stock to continue to work in the near term,\u201d Ivana Delevska, chief investment officer at SPEAR Invest, said in an interview. \u201cIf Tesla can\u2019t deliver on margins, the rally could stall out, as investors would question the strategy to cut prices.\u201d\n\nAnalysts\u2019 average profit estimate for the three months ended in June has dropped by 26% since mid-January. Those slumping expectations contrast sharply with the more than 140% rally in the stock this year that has lifted Tesla\u2019s market valuation above $940 billion. The shares are trading up as much as 1.4% Wednesday ahead of the results.\n\nThough a large part of this year\u2019s rally was fueled by an investor dash for companies with exposure to AI, some of it came after several large and startup automakers said they will adopt Tesla\u2019s tech for vehicle charging, making it almost the standard for North America. Still, analysts including Wells Fargo\u2019s Colin Langan see a relatively limited impact from this on earnings.\n\nOn top of that, the strength in mega-cap stocks such as Tesla is starting to look stretched, suggesting an inflection point may be close. \u201cLeadership by mega-cap tech favorites is hitting past extremes,\u201d said Lori Calvasina, head of US equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, noting that the \u201cleadership may be on the cusp of rotation.\u201d\n\nStill, Tesla\u2019s earnings may end up being a side-show if chief executive officer Elon Musk gives investors highly-anticipated updates on new products, refreshes of existing vehicles and AI. A sign that margins can start improving from here on can also provide another boost to the stock. Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives expects the second-quarter to mark the trough for margins, while Morningstar\u2019s Seth Goldstein sees them reaching a low this year before climbing again, helped by lower production costs.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the stock doubles from here, but with actual earnings growth and a strong statement in forward guidance, it could lead the shares higher,\u201d Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management, said in an interview.\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nMicrosoft Corp.\u2019s year-to-date gain of 50% as of Tuesday\u2019s close has taken the stock 1.2% above the average analyst price target. On a closing basis, this is the most the software giant has been above the average target since 2020, though the premium hit its highest since 2013 in Tuesday trading. Much of the 2023 rally reflects investor excitement over artificial intelligence, and on Tuesday, the stock gained after the company detailed pricing for some artificial-intelligence services.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nASML Holding NV\u2019s orders rose in the second quarter as demand for its chip-making machines is picking up, signaling optimism that a slump in the semiconductor industry may be nearing an end.

Should Taiwan Semiconductor be on your short list?\n\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Halliburton (HAL) hasn\u2019t missed since 2018. That\u2019s an amazing track record as the energy industry struggled at the beginning of the pandemic, in 2020. Shares of Halliburton are down 5.4% year-to-date but are up 33.6% over the last year. Halliburton is cheap, with a forward P/E of 12.\n\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Abbott Laboratories (ABT) has beat 8 quarters in a row. Shares haven\u2019t done much this year, falling 2%.

Netflix and Tesla are set to report second quarter earnings after the bell Wednesday. Yahoo Finance Live breaks down some of the top stories of the day.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Here are three things you need to know this morning. Goldman Sachs, the last big bank out of the gate and the results not great. Profit falling 58% from a year ago, missing analysts estimates. Earnings taking a big hit from the bank's ongoing exit from consumer lending.\n\nGoldman wrote down $504 million of goodwill related to its consumer platforms unit. That unit including specialty lender Green Sky which Goldman just bought last year, but it's in the process of reviewing bids from potential buyers for it. The results are likely to intensify the scrutiny of CEO David Solomon who is wrestling from everything from partner unrest to concerns about strategy.\n\nTroubled used car retailer Carvana reached a deal with bondholders in an effort to lower interest payments and put its business back on more solid footing. The agreement reduces the company's total outstanding debt by over $1.2 billion but also eliminates more than 83% of Carvana's 2025 and 2027 unsecured note maturities.\n\nThe company thrived during the pandemic when demand for cars surged, but a lot of debt, a big acquisition, and falling used car prices sent the stock and the company down a bumpy path. The company's chief financial officer Mark Jenkins says this transaction will help, quote, drive significant profitability and help Carvana return to growth. Shares are soaring on the news.\n\nAnd Netflix and Tesla are the first of the tech giants fueling this year's market rally to report second quarter results. That comes after the close today. Tesla shares are up nearly 130% this year as investors have celebrated everything from the company's AI-related hype to the rapid expansion of its supercharger network. The primary focus for Tesla will be on gross margins as investors weigh how recent price cuts are affecting profits.\n\nAs for Netflix, shares there just above 50% this year. Investors hoping to see benefits from the password-sharing crackdown and keeping a close eye for commentary from company executives on how any fallout from work stoppages in Hollywood could affect the company.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/video/carvana-debt-deal-goldman-sachs-132640994.html", "symbols": ["CV0.F", "CVNA.US", "GS-PC.US", "NFC.F", "NFC.XETRA", "NFLX.MX", "NFLX.US", "NFLX34.SA", "TL0.F", "TL0.XETRA", "TSLA.MX", "TSLA.US", "TSLA34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.984, "neg": 0.08, "neu": 0.783, "pos": 0.137}}, {"date": "2023-07-19T13:22:13+00:00", "title": "Tesla Builds First Cybertruck, Ford Cuts F-150 Lightning Price", "content": "The race for electric truck supremacy continues to evolve.

The vehicle is a preverification build, and it will not be made available for sale. The company aims to initiate Cybertruck's limited production and host its customer delivery event in the third quarter.\n\nFord Announces Major Price Change\n\nFord announced a significant price reduction for its electric F-150 Lightning pickup. The price cut, nearly $10,000 for the least expensive models and at least $6,000 for all others, is a result of successful efforts to enhance production and decrease battery mineral costs.\n\nSince its 2021 introduction, Lightning's prices have been raised multiple times because of supply constraints and escalating mineral prices. But recent factory enhancements aimed at tripling production output are set to rectify this by fall. These upgrades will necessitate a temporary shutdown of the Michigan-based Lightning factory.\n\nTo stay updated with top startup news & investments, sign up for Benzinga's Startup Investing & Equity Crowdfunding Newsletter\n\nDespite challenges such as a five-week production halt following a fire in a newly completed truck, increasing production remains a key goal for Ford CEO Jim Farley. After the latest reductions, the entry-level Pro trim Lightning now costs around $50,000, down from $60,000. The premium extended-range Platinum model has dropped from over $98,000 to approximately $92,000.\n\nFord only sold 4,466 Lightnings in the second quarter but hopes for a better showing in quarters three and four.\n\nWith both Tesla and Ford making big moves with their respective electric pickup trucks, expect plenty of fireworks in the months to come.

If you want to skip our introduction of the NASDAQ index and this year's stock rally, then head on over to 5 Best NASDAQ Stocks Under $50.\n\nThe NASDAQ is the second biggest stock exchange in the world. Data from the World Federation of Exchanges shows just how big the NASDAQ market is. As of June 2023, global equity markets had a market capitalization of $105 trillion, out of which $20 trillion is simply accounted for by the NASDAQ companies. In percentage terms, the NASDAQ accounts for 19% of the total global equities market capitalization - quite a considerable fact given that there are dozens of stock markets in the world. In fact, all of the stock exchanges in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) have a domestic market capitalization of $25 trillion which is just 25% more than the NASDAQ despite the fact that the latter is a single exchange while the former consists of 46 different stock markets.\n\nSo what makes the NASDAQ so big? Well, if you read us regularly or even briefly follow the stock market and financial news, you'd know that the NASDAQ literally has some of the biggest companies in the world listed for trading. America's big tech, made of firms such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) combined with the electric vehicle giant Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) and the semiconductor darling NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) are worth more on the stock market than what most third world countries have in their central banks. Combined, these six firms have a market value of roughly $9 trillion on the conservative side - implying that they account for nearly half of what the NASDAQ's market capitalization is. This is no small feat considering the fact that more than three thousand securities are listed on the NASDAQ market, and by extension, it's also another perfect example of Pareto's Law - where some of the entities account for the bulk of the values.\n\nNot only does the NASDAQ list some of the biggest, if not\u00a0the biggest companies in the world, but the exchange has had a stunner of a year in 2023. The first half of this year saw the NASDAQ Composite post 33% in gains while the NASDAQ 100 soared by nearly 40%. This is the kind of money that allows for early retirement if you have enough invested in the right stocks. Don't believe us? Consider the fact that if you had invested $100,000 in just Meta's shares at the start of the year, you would have made an additional $147,000 so far in the year - or effectively, more than doubled your money. Expand this to a million dollars and you'll understand the role that big tech has played this year. What's more, is that this is not even the highest profit that you could have made. Consider the fact that if you had believed in Mark Zuckerberg when everyone else was skeptical, which is in November 2022, then your $100,000 would now be worth $351,000 as Meta's 52-week low share price is $88.\n\nThis is the kind of magic that has taken place on the NASDAQ amidst worries that the U.S. economy will tip into a recession due to rapid monetary policy tightening by the Federal Reserve. Yet, this magic has not gone unnoticed by the managers of the exchange, Nasdaq, Inc. (NASDAQ:NDAQ), who announced in early July that they will rebalance the flagship NASDAQ 100 exchange. As of the cut off time for this special rebalance, Microsoft, Apple, NVIDIA, Tesla, and Amazon accounted for nearly 44% of the index's weight, and the rebalance will reduce this to 38.5%. The Nasdaq's rules call for a rebalance when companies that have a weight of 4.5% cumulatively exceed the index weight by 48%, and a rally in Tesla's shares triggered this rule according to Wells Fargo. This change will impact exchange traded funds (ETFs) that track the index and also investment portfolios that have followed the broader index in assigning their stock weights.

IBM also releases earnings.\n\nForecast-beating banks leading this week's latest stock rally get an update today from Goldman Sachs. Investment bank rival Morgan Stanley surged 6% on Tuesday after it outpaced expectations as its wealth management trumped downbeat trading. Bank of America jumped over 4% on its beat.\n\nWith almost 10% of the S&P500 now reported, more than 80% have beat the Street so far. The S&P500 and Nasdaq powered ahead on Tuesday, notching their best levels since April last year and futures held those gains ahead of Tuesday's opening bell.\n\nMarkets have been electrified again over the past week amid hopes that U.S. disinflation is proceeding at a pace fast enough to end the Federal Reserve's interest rate rise campaign after one last hike next week. Bonds are buoyed, with 10-year yields edged down again on Wednesday to their lowest for the month.\n\nThat renewed ebullience has fanned out across developed markets, with MSCI's all-country index also hitting 15-month highs and on course Wednesday for its longest streak of consecutive daily gains in more than two years.\n\nThat mood was helped by news that Britain finally appeared to be joining the disinflation club in June, with its headline inflation rate falling back below 8% for the first time in more than year and core inflation ebbing below 7%.\n\nAfter four straight monthly misses, the below-forecast outcome was some relief to UK markets - where government bond yields fell, FTSE stocks jumped and the pumped-up pound recoiled. Significantly it dragged money markets' assumption of peak Bank of England interest rates back below 6% for the first time in well over a month.\n\nEuropean government bond yields also ebbed amid indications from European Central Bank officials this week that its rate rise program may also be close to an end.\n\nSterling's retreat helped lift the dollar more generally , but China's yuan also subsided again amid growing worries about the stuttering domestic economy, re-kindled property sector worries and a stock market that's underperformed world indices by about 20% this year - and fell again on Wednesday.\n\nThe lack of any major stimulus plan from government, deepening gepolitucal concerns and increasingly wary foreign investors rankle. Foreign direct investment into China shrank by 2.7% in the first half compared to the same period last year, the commerce ministry said on Wednesday, adding foriegn trade faced an 'extremely severe' situation for the rest of the year.\n\nOn the U.S. data front, retail sales and industrial production numbers out on Tuesday showed the economy plodding along - good for the disinflation picture, but more worrying on underlying demand.\n\nRebounding U.S. housing markets get a test from June starts and permits updates later on Wednesday.\n\nEvents to watch for later on Wednesday: * U.S. corporate earnings: Tesla, Goldman Sachs, Netflix, IBM, Kinder Morgan, United Airlines, Halliburton, M&T Bank, Northern Trust, Zions Bancorp, US Bancorp, Citizens Financial, Nasdaq, Equifax, Discover Financial, Crown Castle, Steel Dynamics, Baker Hughes, Elevance Health * U.S. June housing starts and permits * U.S. Treasury auctions 20-year bonds\n\n(By Mike Dolan, editing by XXXX mike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com.

Why Now Is the Time to Lock in Some Gains.", "content": "China-based electric vehicle manufacturer Nio (NYSE:NIO) needs a positive catalyst \u2013 the sooner, the better. Otherwise, it will to be hard to justify the NIO stock rally that\u2019s been in progress since early June.\n\nNio\u2019s shareholders should be prepared for a pullback, and might even consider selling before it\u2019s too late.\n\nNio still has to compete against rival EV manufacturer Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) as well as Chinese automakers. There was a bit of positive news on that front, but now it appears to have been canceled. All in all, 2023\u2019s second half could be rough for Nio and its investors.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGood News and Bad News for NIO Stock\n\nNot long ago, Morgan Stanley analyst Tim Hsiao considered NIO stock a \u201cshow-me\u201d stock. It will \u201ctake a few more rounds of guidance \u2018meet or beat\u2019 to fully restore market confidence in NIO, in our view,\u201d Hsiao declared.\n\nI tend to agree with Hsiao\u2019s misgivings concerning Nio. The automaker delivered 10,707 vehicles in June 2023, which is around 17% less than the 12,961 vehicles that Nio delivered in June of last year.\n\nFurthermore, as Eddie Pan pointed out, Nio\u2019s vehicle deliveries for the three months ended June 30 were down 6% year over year.\n\nYet, NIO stock jumped from around $7.50 at the beginning of June to more than $10. There was some optimism recently as Tesla and 15 other EV manufacturers in China, including Nio, signed a fair-competition agreement brokered by the China Association of Auto Manufacturers.\n\nThe participating automakers reportedly pledged to avoid \u201cabnormal pricing.\u201d Nio would have benefited from this agreement, as it may have prevented Tesla from slashing its EV prices in China.\n\nHowever, it appears that CAAM has just canceled this pact. So, that potentially positive catalyst for Nio is evidently dead on arrival.\n\nNio\u2019s Chief Executive Lodges a Complaint\n\nSpeaking of competition from Tesla, Nio CEO William Li reportedly complained that Tesla has unfettered access China\u2019s EV market. At the same time, Li alleges, Chinese companies have to deal with tariffs and regulations in the U.S.\n\nLi\u2019s contention may be valid or not, but that\u2019s a matter for a separate debate. Investors must be realistic about the prospects of fair trade actually occurring anytime soon between China and the U.S.\n\nNio\u2019s chief executive can certainly discuss perceived fair-trade barriers, but the investing community is looking for execution on Nio\u2019s part. Thus, we circle back to Hsiao\u2019s characterization of NIO stock as a \u201cshow-me\u201d stock.\n\nIt\u2019s probably the best policy for prospective shareholders to just sit on the sidelines and wait for Nio\u2019s upcoming operational and financial results.\n\nNIO Stock Could Cough Up Its Gains\n\nNio just lost a major catalyst as the CAAM-brokered price-war truce is now canceled. Despite Li\u2019s complaint, Sino-U.S. tensions linger and the fair trade he\u2019s seeking isn\u2019t likely to materialize anytime soon.\n\nTherefore, while the rally in NIO stock has been impressive, it\u2019s probably not sustainable. Be prepared for a possible decline in the Nio share price, and think carefully about the risk-to-reward proposition if you\u2019re considering investing now.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Electric carmaker Tesla and streaming group Netflix will also deliver results after the bell. Elsewhere, Microsoft announces the price of its new generative artificial intelligence service in its productivity software.\n\n1. Goldman Sachs to round out bank earnings\n\nGoldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is set to unveil its latest returns on Wednesday, with some investors bracing for the Wall Street powerhouse to potentially report one of its weakest quarters ever.\n\nA slowdown in stock and bond trading, as well as an expected drop in lucrative investment banking fees, are projected to have weighed heavily on Goldman over the last three months.\n\nRecent results from the banking giant's closest rivals point to the impact of the dearth in dealmaking. On Tuesday, Goldman peer Morgan Stanley's (NYSE:MS) second quarter revenue from sales and trading slipped by more than a fifth.\n\nBut analysts worry that Goldman faces other issues; namely, an anticipated write-down worth several hundred million dollars from its purchase of home improvement lending group GreenSky, and losses on its consumer and real estate loan portfolios.\n\nChief executive David Solomon and other members of Goldman's management team have already flagged that this will be a challenging quarter. But just how bad it will be remains uncertain.\n\n2. Tesla and Netflix ahead\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) are also among the biggest businesses on tap to report results Wednesday as the parade of second quarter earnings gathers speed.\n\nFor Tesla, the focus will likely center around the EV giant's gross margin, which analysts expect will slump to a \"trough\" following a series of price cuts aimed at boosting volumes and countering intensifying competition.\n\nTesla shares, however, have surged over the past three months thanks to solid delivery numbers and charging deals with legacy automakers like GM (NYSE:GM) and Ford (NYSE:F). The stock has also been swept up in the enthusiasm around companies with exposure to artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nMeanwhile, investors are curious to see how Netflix has fared after it launched a drive in May to crack down on password sharing between users. According to data from streaming analytics company Antenna cited by the Wall Street Journal, the number of new sign-ups in the U.S. between May 25 and 28 hit its highest level over a four-day period since Antenna first began compiling the figures. However, cancelations increased in June, per Antenna.\n\nObservers are also keen to see if Netflix has any comments around the ongoing strike by Hollywood's writers and actors. Co-chief executive Ted Sarandos said in May that, even if these labor actions come to pass, Netflix can still rely on a \"robust\" slate of upcoming content.\n\nBoth Tesla and Netflix are scheduled to report after the close of U.S. trading.\n\n3. Futures hover near flatline\n\nU.S. stock futures ticked up on Wednesday, but stayed mostly around the flatline, as traders looked ahead to another busy earnings day.\n\nAt 05:04 ET (09:04 GMT), the Dow futures contract added 54 points or 0.15%, S&P 500 futures rose by 2 point or 0.05%, and Nasdaq 100 futures increased by 13 points or 0.08%.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average is coming off its seventh consecutive positive session, while the benchmark S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite also rose. The main indices jumped to their best close since April 2022.\n\nMore than 80% of the 38 companies in the S&P 500 that have posted results have delivered earnings beats, CNBC reported, citing FactSet data. Coupled with last week's slower-than-anticipated inflation data, the solid earnings could help bolster the case that the U.S. economy may be able to avoid a sharp downturn despite an unprecedented series of interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.\n\n4. Microsoft closes at record high\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) shares notched their highest close on record Tuesday after the software behemoth announced the pricing of its suite of AI tools.\n\nThe Redmond, Washington-based tech group said it would charge $30 per month for access to its generative AI features in its uber-popular productivity services like Microsoft 365.\n\nAnalysts projected that the move, which would slap a large premium on top of the average monthly cost paid by Microsoft 365 customers, could lead to a significant boost in revenues. In a note, Wedbush analysts said they were \u201cvery bullish for the total addressable cloud AI market opportunity for Microsoft that could increase cloud revenue annually by 20% by 2025[.]\"\n\nChief executive Satya Nadella defended the hefty price tag, saying in an interview with the Financial Times that the new AI features are \"the same class of value\" as its other ubiquitous applications like Word, Excel, and Teams.\n\n5. Oil inches up amid supply constraints, demand worries\n\nCrude prices edged higher Wednesday with traders eyeing supply strains, concerns over U.S. demand, and promises by China's government to take measures to reinvigorate the country's sputtering post-pandemic recovery.\n\nAt 05:03 ET, the U.S. crude futures moved up by 0.56% to $76.08 a barrel, while the Brent contract gained 0.72% to $80.20 per barrel.\n\nOn the supply side, data from the industry body American Petroleum Institute on Tuesday showed that U.S. crude stockpiles fell about 0.8 million barrels last week, after a substantially bigger-than-expected build in the prior week. Government figures from the Energy Information Administration are due later in the session.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is widely projected to increase borrowing costs by a further 25 basis points this month, according to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool. The decision could weigh on demand in the U.S., the world's largest oil consumer.\n\nMeanwhile, China, the world's second-biggest economy and top oil importer, barely grew in the second quarter. But Beijing has pledged to introduce new policies to \"restore and expand\" consumption in the country, which could give some lift to oil demand.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nGoldman Sachs to report, Tesla and Netflix on tap - what's moving markets\n\nHere is how Halliburton and Baker Hughes performed in Q2\n\nNissan, Renault ready to announce new alliance deal in days -sources", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goldman-sachs-report-tesla-netflix-054405274.html", "symbols": ["F.US", "GM.US", "GOS.F", "GOS.XETRA", "GS-PA.US", "GS-PD.US", "GS-PJ.US", "GS-PK.US", "GS.MX", "GS.US", "GSGI34.SA", "MS.US", "MSFT.US", "NFC.XETRA", "NFLX.MX", "NFLX.US", "NFLX34.SA", "TSLA.US"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.994, "neg": 0.051, "neu": 0.845, "pos": 0.103}}, {"date": "2023-07-19T03:06:35+00:00", "title": "European stocks gain after U.K. CPI grows more slowly than expected", "content": "Investing.com - European stock markets traded higher Wednesday after cooler-than-expected U.K. inflation, while investors await more earnings from major U.S. companies.\n\nAt 03:30 ET (07:30 GMT), the DAX index in Germany traded 0.3% higher, the FTSE 100 in the U.K. gained 1.3% and the CAC 40 in France rose 0.4%.\n\nU.K. CPI cools in June\n\nThe latest consumer prices out of the U.K. showed inflation cooling more than expected, with annual CPI coming in at 7.9% in June, a fall from 8.7% the prior month and below the expected drop to 8.1%.\n\nThe drop in the headline figure will be welcomed by the policymakers at the Bank of England, but they are likely to be more impressed with the fall in the core number to 6.9% from 7.1%.\n\nMarkets have already priced another 100 basis points of Bank of England rate rises this year, but these numbers will ease some of the pressure on the Bank of England to keep on raising interest rates sharply.\n\nFinal eurozone CPI also due\n\nThe final reading of the June euro zone CPI is also due later in the session, and is expected to confirm that inflation rose 5.5% on the year last month, a drop from 6.1% the prior month.\n\nThe European Central Bank is widely expected to increase interest rates once more when it meets next week, but debate still exists about how far the central bank goes with its tightening after this.\n\n\"For July it is a necessity,\u201d governing council member Klaas Knot, a known hawk, said in an interview on Tuesday, regarding interest rate increases, \u201cfor anything beyond July it would at most be a possibility, but by no means a certainty.\"\n\nRenault first-half sales jump\n\nIn the corporate sector, Renault (EPA:RENA) stock rose 1.1% after the French auto giant said its worldwide sales rose 13% in the first six months of the year, with a 24% increase in Europe, rebounding after four consecutive years of declines.\n\nVolvo (ST:VOLVb) stock fell 2.5% after the Swedish truck maker announced a decrease of 10% in order intake for the quarter, even as it raised its outlook for the European and North American markets.\n\nHowever, most attention will be on the quarterly earnings releases across the pond, with numbers scheduled from the likes of streaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), EV manufacturer Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and banking behemoth Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).\n\nCrude stable despite falling U.S. inventories\n\nOil prices stabilized Wednesday after the previous session\u2019s strong gains, with traders balancing declining U.S. inventories and concerns over China\u2019s stuttering growth.\n\nData from the industry body American Petroleum Institute, released Tuesday, showed that U.S. crude stockpiles fell 0.8 million barrels last week, after a substantially bigger-than-expected build in the prior week.\n\nGovernment data from the Energy Information Administration are due later in the session, for confirmation.\n\nHowever, China\u2019s economy, the second largest in the world, barely grew in the second quarter, and worries about the associated oil demand growth continue to weigh as traders look for more stimulus from Beijing.\n\nBy 03:30 ET, the U.S. crude futures traded 0.2% lower at $75.50 a barrel, while the Brent contract dropped 0.1% to $79.58.\n\nAdditionally, gold futures rose 0.1% to $1,982.95/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1233.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nEuropean stocks gain after U.K. CPI grows more slowly than expected\n\nUSDA, states eye cheaper food by targeting anticompetitive acts\n\nGoldman Sachs CEO's growth strategy gets traction with board-sources", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/european-stocks-gain-u-k-030635645.html", "symbols": ["FCHI.INDX", "FTSE.INDX", "GDAXI.INDX", "GS.US", "NFLX.US", "TSLA.US"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.977, "neg": 0.06, "neu": 0.837, "pos": 0.103}}, {"date": "2023-07-19T00:30:00+00:00", "title": "Tesla Rival Nissan Has More Awful News on Its Electric Vehicles", "content": "Electric vehicle industry's top company Tesla has a comfortable lead over the EV competition for production and deliveries.

According to Reuters, this achievement comes after a two-year delay. Back in 2019, Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla, unveiled the pickup truck, during which the vehicle's designer accidentally broke the supposedly indestructible \"armor glass\" windows.\n\nSince then, Tesla has faced multiple setbacks and had to postpone the production timeline. Last year, Musk attributed the delay to component shortages for the Cybertruck. However, during a shareholder meeting in May, Musk expressed the company's goal of manufacturing around 250,000 Cybertrucks annually, depending on market demand.\n\nThe launch of the Cybertruck will allow Tesla to enter one of the most lucrative sectors of the U.S. market, providing competition to electric pickups offered by Ford Motor F and Rivian Automotive RIVN. Although both Ford and Rivian have already introduced their respective models in limited quantities, Tesla's entry into this segment is highly anticipated.\n\nStrong Quarterly Growth to Drive Profits?\n\nTesla's aggressive pricing cut strategy, aimed at boosting sales and fending off competition, likely fueled its most robust revenue growth in five quarters. However, per Reuters, Tesla's earnings on Jul 19, are expected to show to a decline in profit margins, reaching a three-year low for the April to June period. The electric vehicle manufacturer initiated a price war in late 2022 to stimulate demand and counter competition posed by traditional automakers like Ford Motor and Chinese counterparts like BYD.\n\nAlthough only marginally higher than the prior three months, the second quarter's growth in Tesla vehicle deliveries can be linked to the company's significant discounts, which came at the expense of its profit margins.\n\nIn an effort to expand its revenue streams amid a slowdown in electric vehicle (EV) sales, Tesla has taken assertive steps to gain a larger market share in the U.S. charging industry. By collaborating with notable companies such as Ford Motor and General Motors GM, Tesla has facilitated the adoption of its North American Charging Standard, which has propelled Tesla's market value to $880 billion.\n\nWhile the immediate impact on second-quarter revenue due to these partnerships is expected to be minimal, with Refinitiv projecting a 45.2% increase to $24.59 billion, analysts anticipate a significant boost to Tesla's top line in the future.\n\nBy diversifying into the charging market and establishing itself as a prominent standard, Tesla aims to mitigate the effects of sluggish EV sales and tap into new avenues for revenue generation.\n\nETFs in Focus\n\nAgainst this backdrop, investors can keep a tab on Meet Kevin Pricing Power ETF PP, Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund XLY, Fidelity MSCI Consumer Discretionary Index ETF FDIS, ARK Autonomous Technology & Robotics ETF ARKQ and Vanguard Consumer Discretionary ETF VCR.\n\nThe above-mentioned ETFs have an exposure of 22.64%, 19.82%, 15.48%, 14.44% and 13.39%, respectively, in Tesla.

(NYSE:F) announced on Monday that it will be lowering prices for its popular F-150 Lightning model. Although the company claimed supply-side variables drove the decision, the stock's subsequent slump suggests the financial markets interpreted the news as a sign of receding profit margins.\n\nFinancial markets often overreact to news, making it difficult to judge the amplitude of the newly received information. As such, I decided to decode the event and discuss other matters related to the stock.\n\nPrice cuts and Ford's key segment performance\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with F. Click here to check it out.  F 15-Year Financial Data The intrinsic value of F Peter Lynch Chart of F\n\nUnderstandably, Ford's price cut statement shocked the market as demand for durable goods across the globe has resulted in softening results for some of the world's leading automakers. However, Ford maintained that lower prices for its electric truck are due to lower input costs instead of demand-side issues.\n\nAccording to Chief Customer Officer Martin Gjaja, \"Shortly after launching the F-150 Lightning, rapidly rising material costs, supply constraints and other factors drove up the cost of the EV truck for Ford and our customers. We've continued to work in the background to improve accessibility and affordability to help to lower prices for our customers and shorten the wait times for their new F-150 Lightning.\"\n\nA few factors suggest Gjaja's statements can be substantiated. First, Ford released its latest North American sales report earlier this month, which revealed an 11.2% quarterly uptick in broad-based sales and a 34% increase in F-Series sales. Moreover, the company's F-150 Lightning experienced another solid quarter as it boasted an impressive 119% year-on-year increase in quarterly sales. Thus, the company's sales data dictates that demand remains robust, phasing out the possibility the price cut is demand-induced.\n\nA second reason why Gjaja's statements might align with reality pertains to the competitive landscape of the electronic vehicles market. Ford and Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) will attempt to cannibalize their competition within the North American EVs market to consolidate their market positions by raising the barriers to entry for new potential players.\n\nLastly, the U.S. government recently approved a $9.2 billion contingent loan to Ford for the development of three new electronic vehicle batteries. Many reports suggest the loan is contingent on price cuts, which might explain why the F-150 Lighting's prices are singled out.\n\nPotential for lower input costs\n\nAn overlooked factor pertaining to Ford is its potential to recognize lower input costs after an abrupt downturn in certain manufacturing costs. For example, energy costs have diminished due to a slump in oil and gas prices. Additionally, shipping costs have depleted significantly since the turn of the year, leading to smoother up and downstream supply chains.\n\nA combination of lower input costs and sustained sales volumes suggest Ford's gross and net profit margins might soon return to their all-time highs. What's Next for Ford After Price Cuts?\n\nCapex cycle remains intact\n\nA company's capital expenditure line item is worth a thousand words, often revealing a company's confidence about future results. Businesses regularly increase their capital expenditures whenever they anticipate strong sales, and the signs are that Ford has done just that.\n\nThe company's management expects capital expenditures to reach $8 billion to $9 billion by the time 2023's full-year results are filed, which is an upgrade from the previous year's $6.8 billion.\n\nFord is on an aggressive reinvestment route as it plans to expand its electronic vehicles segment while restructuring its internal combustion segment. However, the company's capex guidance probably would have been lower had Ford anticipated softer sales numbers.\n\nValuation\n\nAlthough Ford's fundamentals seem strong, it does pose a few valuation risks. For one, the stock's price multiples indicate the stock is priced in with little value in store. What's Next for Ford After Price Cuts?\n\nFurther, I constructed a discounted cash flow model, which revealed a price target of $13.76. Thus, implying the stock is overvalued on an absolute basis.\n\nI used the following input variables to construct the DCF model.\n\nA growth horizon of 10 years was combined with a terminal growth period. The company's free cash flow growth for the initial growth period was assumed at 9.01% and the terminal period at 3%. A discount rate of 10% was incorporated. What's Next for Ford After Price Cuts?\n\nDividends\n\nFord's forward dividend yield of 4.24% ranks within the 82nd industry percentile, showcasing why the stock is alluring to income-seeking investors. Although cyclicality often plays a role in its dividend policy, no material signs suggest its dividend payout will weaken anytime soon. What's Next for Ford After Price Cuts?\n\nFinal word\n\nThe market has acted unfavorably toward Ford's F-150 Lightning price cut, suggesting many believe diminishing profitability is en route. However, a recent sales report shows the company is subject to strong demand with a lower price allowing for a potential increase in market share and satisfying a contingent feature of its $9.2 billion battery factory loan.\n\nAlthough valuation metrics suggest the stock is priced in, Ford's fundamentals remain robust, which could sustain its dividend profile and lead to steady value accumulation.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/whats-next-ford-price-cuts-211324968.html", "symbols": ["F.MX", "F.US", "FDMO34.SA", "FMC1.F", "FMC1.XETRA", "TSLA.US"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.983, "neg": 0.073, "neu": 0.824, "pos": 0.103}}, {"date": "2023-07-18T21:12:33+00:00", "title": "Goldman Sachs, Tesla, Netflix: Earnings to watch on Wednesday", "content": "Goldman Sachs, Tesla, and Netflix are on tap to report their corporate earnings on Wednesday.

Yahoo Finance Automotive Reporter Pras Subramanian breaks down three things to watch.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nSEANA SMITH: Tesla gearing up for second quarter earnings tomorrow after the bell, the stock skyrocketing more than 55% in the last three months. Here with the top things to watch, we want to bring in Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian. Pras, you've got your eye on three things that we need to be looking for in this report tomorrow. What are they?\n\nPRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah, so three things I'm watching here, and analysts, of course, is, first off, gross margin trough, the Cybertruck, and also margin-- I'm sorry, expansion of the factory. So let's start off with the margin trough here.\n\nSo a lot of analysts believe that this quarter might be the low point in terms of Tesla's margins, which have been the-- you know, the envy of the industry. They hit around at 19% automotive gross margin last quarter, so people are expecting them to dip again in Q2, but then possibly rise later in the year. Hopefully for investors they'll hear whether Tesla indicates that that is the case.\n\nSecondly, Cybertruck. So yesterday-- sorry, over the weekend we saw that Tesla tweeted out a picture of that Cybertruck, and that first one produced out of the Giga Austin facility. That's a big deal because, you know, Tesla was sort of two years late in bringing that truck on, but right now it seems like they are actually starting to produce in low quantities. Let's see what they say in the earnings statement and possibly in the call after. Is this just a pre-verification build? Is this truck actually going to be delivered to a customer? We'll see about that.\n\nAnd finally expansion, right? So Tesla here, you know, they probably have around 2 million, 2.5 million of vehicle capacity right now. They want to hit 20 million by the end of the decade. That's going to be more factories. So Tesla's been talking recently. We've seen them in France and India talking about expansion. They're just doing some sort of operational activity there.\n\nAnd then also, the journal reported yesterday that Tesla has been-- wants to expand Giga Berlin by double, to increase that capacity by double, so we'll hopefully hear more about their long term plans on how they-- how they plan to build up to 20 million vehicles by the end of the decade.\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: Pras, going back to the Cybertruck, I mean, you know, yes, there's a lot of excitement around this delivery event that's supposed to happen this fall, but the initial announcement was made back in 2019, right? Did I get my years right? 2019. If you think about where the EV truck competition is right now, who are-- who are they going for? Who's likely to go for the Tesla? How can they compete when other competitors have already come online with their cars?\n\nPRAS SUBRAMANIAN: That's a really good question. I think that the Cybertruck kind of occupies its own space in between the F-150 Lightning, which is a work truck, and something of an adventure truck, but mostly a work truck type of everyday kind of vehicle, and then the Rivian, which is purely, in my opinion, hardcore adventure people going out overlanding, camping, all that stuff that coastal types of people will do.\n\nI think that Cybertruck occupies that middle ground where it can actually be used for both work truck type of activities but also lifestyle and sort of the adventure travel set there. I think that's where the Tesla kind of Cybertruck occupies that space, and we saw Ford sort of reacting here maybe to the news that Tesla was bringing out this cybertruck in possibly limited fashion in this quarter with those deep price cuts of the F-150 Lightning just yesterday. I'm not I'm not saying that's because of that, but it could be. It's not incoincidental that both of these things happen in the last two days.\n\nSEANA SMITH: Yeah, well, the competition certainly is heating up in the electric pickup space. I'm with Akiko, though. I don't know who the heck is going to be buying this Cybertruck. I'm not sold. I feel like the design is just way too futuristic for me. But we'll see. There's always people out there that are willing to buy these things. All right, Pras Subramanian, thanks.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/video/tesla-earnings-expect-201117793.html", "symbols": ["TL0.F", "TL0.XETRA", "TSLA.MX", "TSLA.US", "TSLA34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.986, "neg": 0.027, "neu": 0.909, "pos": 0.064}}, {"date": "2023-07-18T20:09:02+00:00", "title": "Forget Tesla: These 3 EV Stocks Could Be Better Bets Right Now", "content": "The electric vehicle (EV) industry is thriving and shows no signs of slowing down. With 10% of the nation\u2019s light-duty vehicle market being electric, there is significant growth potential. In 2021, 9% of new cars sold were electric, and this is expected to increase to 14%. The International Energy Agency predicts that by 2030, 60% of new vehicles sold will be electric.\n\nThe future of the EV industry looks bright. Investors have an excellent opportunity to invest in the top EV stocks. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has been one of the top-performing EV stocks, but up-and-coming companies may outperform in the future. This article highlights three of the best alternatives to Tesla stock.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nByd Co. (BYDDF) BYD Company Limited logo in front of their website. BYDDY stock.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock\n\nBYD Co. (OTCMKTS:BYDDF) is one of the top EV stocks to consider. It recently reported a staggering 411% increase in Q1 profits, reaching 4.13 billion yuan ($600 million). Sales also rose by about 80% to 120.2 billion yuan.\n\nBYD is expanding in overseas markets and is set to release a new electric SUV to compete directly with Tesla\u2019s Model Y. CNBC reports that the Denza brand has received over 20,000 pre-orders for the N7 SUV, priced between 301,800 yuan and 379,800 yuan ($41,680 to $52,452).\n\nMoreover, BYD Co. is a strong contender in the EV market, along with Tesla\u00a0and Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VWAGY). With China\u2019s rapid adoption of EVs and a strong potential for growth, BYD has a chance to lead in the next five years.\n\nAlthough Tesla currently maintains the lead, selling around 423k EVs in the first quarter compared to BYD\u2019s approximately 265k, BYD\u2019s growth trajectory is impressive. It experienced an 85% year-over-year sales increase, while Tesla\u2019s growth lagged behind at 36%.\n\nChargePoint (CHPT) EV stocks: A close-up shot of a ChargePoint charging station.\n\nSource: YuniqueB / Shutterstock.com\n\nChargePoint (NYSE:CHPT) is a leading provider of EV charging solutions with a global network of over 200,000 charging ports. While not a direct EV stock, it stands to benefit significantly from the growing EV market.\n\nWith a market share of over 65% and a strong network effect, ChargePoint is a solid investment option. Despite its current undervalued status, the demand for EV charging is expected to experience exponential growth as countries phase out fossil-fuel vehicles.\n\nMcKinsey reports that the U.S. goal of having 48 million EVs on the road by 2030 would require a charging infrastructure 20 times larger than the current size.\n\nWith its established market share, ChargePoint is well-positioned to capture a significant portion of this expanding market. Even with a 30% market share, it has the potential for substantial returns.\n\nChargePoint\u00a0is an EV charging infrastructure company set for growth. With a promising Q1 2024 report showing 59% year-over-year revenue growth to $130 million and an improved gross margin, the company is positioned for further success.\n\nAs the number of installed charging stations continues to increase, recurring revenue will drive margin improvement. Positive prospects suggest an attractive investment opportunity.\n\nLi Auto (LI) Li Auto (Li Xiang) brand logo and electric car in store. A Chinese EV(electric vehicle) company\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nLi Auto (NASDAQ:LI) is expected to transition to fully electric vehicles as battery technology improves and charging infrastructure expands. While gasoline engines still offer a favorable balance between range and weight for current car buyers, Li Auto differentiates itself from brands like Toyota (NYSE:TM) by focusing on plug-in hybrid vehicles that prioritize electric power in the drivetrain.\n\nMoreover, Li Auto CEO Xiang Li revealed that the company plans to launch its highly anticipated Li MEGA electric vehicle model in the fourth quarter of this year. The CEO expressed confidence that the Li MEGA will be a successful sales hit in the premium price segment. Exciting updates are expected, so stay tuned for more information.\n\nLi Auto\u2019s vehicle deliveries surged in the first half of 2023, surpassing its total deliveries for 2022. In June, Li Auto outperformed its rivals, Nio (NYSE:NIO) and XPeng (NYSE:XPEV), with higher vehicle deliveries, while both competitors experienced a decline in deliveries compared to the previous year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nChris MacDonald\u2019s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

Its blending of technology, market acumen, and infrastructural prowess makes Tesla a compelling talking point.\n\nBut let\u2019s not just lean on potential alone.

Furthermore, Tesla\u2019s Q1 2023 earnings report radiates positivity, with revenues climbing by 24%.\n\nHere\u2019s to the future, where green is the new gold, and companies like Tesla lead the charge.\n\nChargePoint Holdings (CHPT) CHPT a chargepoint charging station\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmong the high-potential EV charging stocks to consider, ChargePoint Holdings (NYSE:CHPT) stands out. The company\u2019s latest earnings report showcased encouraging figures, with revenue reaching $130 million, a significant increase of 59% year-over-year.\n\nAdditionally, ChargePoint\u2019s recent announcement of offering connectors for Tesla\u2019s charging standard further solidifies its position in the market. These developments will likely contribute positively to the company\u2019s revenue growth and enhance its overall value proposition.\n\nAs the electric vehicle industry surges, ChargePoint Holdings remains an AI-recommended EV charging stock. Investors should watch it closely for potential long-term gains.\n\nEVgo (EVGO) EVgo fast charging station\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs July revs its engines, savvy investors chart new territories within the high-potential EV charging market. One intriguing contender is EVgo (NASDAQ:EVGO), a trailblazer in the EV charging realm. Notwithstanding its year-long slump of 41%, there\u2019s more to EVgo than meets the eye.\n\nThis American-based powerhouse has flexed its financial muscles with a striking Q1 earnings report. Revenue rose dramatically by 229% year-over-year to $25.3 million. Despite grappling with a net income loss, the report exceeded EPS estimates by a hefty 175%.\n\nAt the same time, EVgo has been widening its scope with a solid plan to intensify its deployment of NACS, an intelligent strategic decision in light of Tesla\u2019s Supercharger advancements. In June, EVgo disclosed that it will incorporate North American Charging Standard connectors into its nationwide fast-charging network. This comes after the declaration from several leading automakers that they will begin using Tesla\u2019s NACS standard.\n\nThis AI-recommended EV charging stock is certainly worth your radar sweep this July. Keep an eye on EVgo as it is set to ride the EV wave into a promising future.\n\nOn the publication date, Faizan Farooque did not hold (directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Prices of other variants of the electric truck such as XLT 312A Extended Range and Platinum have also been reduced.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with F. Click here to check it out.  F 15-Year Financial Data The intrinsic value of F Peter Lynch Chart of F Ford Embraces Tesla's Price War\n\nFor context, the Pro model, at the time of its launch in May 2022, was priced at $39,974. After a year of continued price hikes for its electric trucks, Ford is now adapting a strategy similar to the luxury electric car market leader Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). In the first four months of 2023, Tesla slashed prices of its Model Y and Model 3 vehicles six times, raising concerns about the company's profit margins and worsening industry conditions.\n\nUnlike Tesla, Ford remains cheaply valued on an absolute basis with a price-earnings ratio of just 19.76, but investors will have to closely monitor how recent price cuts will impact the profitability of the company.\n\nThe potential impact of price cuts\n\nTo fully understand the impact of Fords price cuts, investors will have to wait for third and fourth-quarter earnings reports. However, we can potentially gain some insight by thinking about the reasoning behind price cuts. Ford, when announcing the price cuts, highlighted several reasons behind this decision, including its increased production capacity, declining cost of production and declining battery raw material costs. With the Rogue EV Center in Michigan nearing the completion of planned upgrades, the company believes the production capacity at this plant will triple to an annual production run rate of 150,000 F-150 Lightning trucks by fall this year.\n\nCommenting on the price cuts, Ford Model es Chief Customer Officer Marin Gjaja said:\n\n\"Shortly after launching the F-150 Lightning, rapidly rising material costs, supply constraints and other factors drove up the cost of the EV truck for Ford and our customers. Weve continued to work in the background to improve accessibility and affordability to help to lower prices for our customers and shorten the wait times for their new F-150 Lightning.\"\n\nGoing by the reasoning provided by Ford, it seems as if the company can afford to reduce the prices of EV trucks without taking a hit on profit margins. Under normal market conditions, lower prices should also encourage more potential buyers to pull the trigger.\n\nEarly results from Teslas price cuts show that in the second quarter of 2023, Tesla delivered 466,000 vehicles, surpassing the 455,000 expected by analysts. This represents a 10% increase from the vehicle deliveries reported in the first quarter and a staggering 83% year-over-year increase. Commenting on this strong performance, Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said:\n\n\"The price cuts were a smart poker move for Tesla and are paying major dividends in the field, especially for the China market. Tesla continues to play chess while other electric vehicle players are playing checkers and this was another trophy case quarter for Musk and co.\"\n\nThe promising results in the second quarter have prompted Tesla to set an ambitious target to grow deliveries by 50% this year. Thus, I believe that as the U.S.'s number one truck maker, Ford is well-positioned to use price cuts to drive volume growth. If Tesla's results are anything to go buy, demand for EVs remains strong, which would mean price cuts could boost volume for Ford as well.\n\nHowever, if the American economy enters a long and painful recession in the near future, Ford is highly unlikely to reap the rewards of this strategic move. This is a risk that needs to be actively monitored.\n\nOn the profitability side, price cuts (if not accompanied by sufficient demand increases) could push Fords EV business unit into further losses, at least in the short term. In the first quarter, Ford Model e, the companys EV business unit, actually reported an operating loss of $700 million on an Ebit margin of -102.1%. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the Ebit margin stood at -40.4%, which highlights the substantial deterioration of profitability in the first quarter. These results highlight that Fords EV business is nowhere near profitability today, and further price cuts will at best help the company maintain the current level of losses unless demand improves meaningfully to help Ford benefit from scale advantages.\n\nFord is trying to grab a bigger share of the EV market with price cuts even at the expense of short-term profitability. The company is home to the best-selling trucks in the U.S., and it has drawn plans to electrify its fleet of trucks in the coming years. With a competitive pricing strategy, I believe Ford will be able to leverage its popularity among American truck buyers to gain sufficient scale to turn the EV division profitable eventually, but it's definitely not as attractive as Tesla's current profitability.\n\nAttractive valuation\n\nEven though Ford has made steady progress in the last few years to embrace EVs, the market is still valuing the company as a traditional automaker with little growth prospects. Ford is valued at a forward price-earnings ratio of 7.5. In comparison, Tesla is valued at a forward price-earnings ratio of 82 as investors have pushed Tesla's stock price higher. As Ford goes more electric, I believe the valuation disparity between Ford and Tesla is likely to improve in favor of Ford.\n\nFords recently announced EV price cuts will hurt the companys profit margins in the short run, but this decision seems prudent from a long-term perspective in my opinion as the company needs to aggressively grow its EV market shrare.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-embraces-teslas-price-war-170858144.html", "symbols": ["F.MX", "F.US", "FDMO34.SA", "FMC1.F", "FMC1.XETRA", "TL0.F", "TL0.XETRA", "TSLA.MX", "TSLA.US", "TSLA34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.998, "neg": 0.081, "neu": 0.763, "pos": 0.156}}, {"date": "2023-07-18T16:53:35+00:00", "title": "Tesla directors to return more than $735 million to company to settle suit challenging compensation", "content": "DOVER, Del. (AP) \u2014\n\nCurrent and former directors of electric-vehicle maker Tesla Inc. have agreed to return more than $735 million to the company to settle a shareholder lawsuit alleging that they unjustly enriched themselves with excessive compensation.\n\nThe proposed settlement was outlined in documents filed late Friday in the Delaware Court of Chancery and is subject to court approval. The settlement does not include claims involving any other Tesla shareholder suit, including a separate Chancery Court action challenging a compensation package awarded to CEO Elon Musk in 2018 that is potentially worth more than $55 billion. A ruling in that case is expected in the very near future.\n\nThe settlement agreement involves a derivative lawsuit filed on behalf of the company in 2020 by the Police and Fire Retirement System of the City of Detroit, a retirement fund that invested in Tesla and challenged stock options granted to company directors starting in June 2017.\n\nThe settlement agreement calls for the director defendants, including Oracle co-founder and former Tesla board member Larry Ellison, to provide Tesla with the value of more than 3.1 million stock options, in the form of returned cash, returned stock and unexercised stock options. The total value is based on a settlement stock price of $260.54, which was Tesla\u2019s closing share price on June 16. According to the court filing, the parties accepted a settlement recommendation from a mediator on June 20.\n\nThe valuation methods used in the settlement stipulation result in an overall settlement value of $735,266,505, consisting of $458,649,785 in returned options and $276,616,720 in returned cash or returned stock. Any fees awarded to plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys would be deducted from the settlement amount and would reduce the amount of consideration paid to the company.\n\nAs part of the settlement, the director defendants also will permanently forego stock options for 2021 and 2022 and will not receive any further compensation for board service during those years. The board had previously adopted resolutions to forego until this month any automatic grants of annual stock option awards for outside directors for those years. Current directors also will permanently forego any compensation for board service this year.\n\nIn agreeing to the settlement, the defendants denied any wrongdoing or liability, including any allegation that they breached any duty owed to the company.\n\n\u201cSettling defendants also deny that Tesla or its stockholders were harmed by any conduct of settling defendants alleged in the action or that could have been alleged,\u201d the agreement states.\n\nIn June 2017, Tesla shares were trading in the $20 range. On Tuesday, Tesla was trading at about $288 per share.\n\nAttorneys for the Tesla defendants declined to comment on the court filing.\n\nLawyers for both sides are asking the judge to hold a settlement hearing on Oct. 13.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-directors-return-more-735-165335247.html", "symbols": ["TL0.F", "TL0.XETRA", "TSLA.MX", "TSLA.US", "TSLA34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.983, "neg": 0.036, "neu": 0.859, "pos": 0.105}}, {"date": "2023-07-18T16:52:00+00:00", "title": "Elon Musk Takes a Shot at Sen.

GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with C. Click here to check it out.  C 15-Year Financial Data The intrinsic value of C Peter Lynch Chart of C\n\nWith this in mind, I set out using the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, a Premium feature, to see if I could identify some hidden gems. Here are two of the stocks I found during my search.\n\nCitigroup\n\nCitigroup (NYSE:C) is an intriguing contender for those seeking value stocks, in my opinion. Over the past year, the company has faced a challenging period. However, I believe Citigroup could be classified as an undervalued stock with the potential to enhance a value-focused portfolio as its price-earnings ratio is just 7.52.\n\nThe latest earnings report for June 2023 does paint a somewhat gloomy picture. Revenue slipped slightly by 1.05%, reaching $17.68 billion, and net income suffered a more significant blow, falling by 35.89% to $2.92 billion. The diluted earnings per share (EPS) experienced a dip of 39.27%, and the net profit margin contracted by over a third. These figures might appear discouraging at first glance, but it is crucial to recognize that they could lay the foundation for a compelling turnaround story. Due to adverse market conditions and disappointing investment banking revenue, Citigroup's stock price plummeted by nearly 30% in 2022, resulting in a diminished one-year return. However, the banking industry (and Citigroup) could easily recover once the stock market returns to bull territory.\n\nCitigroup's colossal assets under management of $2.4 trillion provides a certain level of resilience against turbulent times. Furthermore, the June 2023 EPS only missed expectations by 3.32% amidst these challenges, indicating underlying strength and stability. The company's disaster during the finanical crisis was regrettable, but I believe the new regulations put in place afterwards should protect Citigroup's investors.\n\nUsuing the GuruFocus discounted cash flow calculator, I get a 41.28% margin of safety estimate when plugging in an expected 10-year EPS growth rate of 5% and a discount rate of 10%.\n\nCitigroup's price-earnings over the past 10 years has ranged from a minimum of 4.73 to a median of 10.28 and a maximum of 24.66. As of now, the price-earnings ratio is below the historical median, which leaves room for upside potential based on a return to past valuation levels.\n\nGeneral Motors\n\nGeneral Motors (NYSE:GM) is a hot name among value stocks as it is stepping up its game in electriv vehicles. Investors are eyeing the success of pure-play EV company Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) for an idea of how GM's valuation multiples could grow as it shifts its vehicle mix.\n\nThe automobile powerhouse revealed its first-quarter results for 2023 not long ago, showcasing impressive revenue growth and elevating its full-year forecast. GM reported a considerable year-over-year revenue boost of 11.13%, pushing the total to $39.99 billion. Even though net income slightly declined, there was an impressive 25.19% surge in GM's diluted earnings per share, a clear signal of the company's proficiency in effectively managing its EV transition even among a difficult supply chain environment.\n\nFurthermore, GM is not merely concentrating on the present. Its forward-thinking ventures highlight its potential to unlock long-term value, in my opinion. Its recent purchase of the battery software startup Algolion is projected to strengthen its position in the burgeoning EV battery sector. A recent deal with Tesla to use its supercharging network highlights expansion of key charging infrastructure that is key to EV sales growth.\n\nFrom my viewpoint, GM's robust financial performance, together with its progressive strategies, earmark it as a potential bargain. Given its steady growth path, I believe this automotive titan is a strong contender among value stocks\n\nAnalyzing GM's price-earnings ratio over the past decade reveals an interesting trend. It's highly volatile, which is due to the cyclical nature of the business. The lowest value recorded was 3.6, while the peak reached 62.21. The median over this period stood at 7.85, suggesting a tendency towards a lower price-earnings ratio. The current price-earnings ratio for GM is 5.98 as of this writing. Since this is a cyclical stock, the low valuation could mean the stock is at the peak of a cyclical upswing, as Peter Lynch discussed extensively in his books. However, I do not believe this is the case due to one key reason - the EV revolution. As EVs grow in popularity, EV makers should see continued increases in sales at the expense of companies that sell only gas-powered cars, helping GM to grab market share.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-hidden-gems-market-overlooking-162946369.html", "symbols": ["8GM.F", "C-PJ.US", "C.MX", "C.US", "CTGP34.SA", "GM.MX", "GM.US", "GMCO34.SA", "TRVC.F", "TRVC.XETRA", "TSLA.US"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.997, "neg": 0.058, "neu": 0.795, "pos": 0.146}}, {"date": "2023-07-18T16:24:26+00:00", "title": "Dow Jones Gains 350 Points; Tesla Slips Amid Analyst Views As Earnings Loom", "content": "Dow Jones rose after softer retail sales numbers.

Worksport\u2019s solar-powered tonneau cover SOLIS and remote power system hold a big promise for electric pickups, with Hyundai Motor Company (OTC: HYMTF) being among the first whose Santa Cruz pickup will be equipped with this revolutionary technology, bringing to the table the comfort of an SUV and open-bed vehicle designed for extraordinary adventures.\n\nWorksport continues on its mission to make a difference with made-in-USA aftermarket automotive accessories and its ground-breaking off-grid energy solutions.\n\nBy gaining this label,\u00a0Worksport proved its commitment to maintaining a supply chain that ensures its products are crafted and assembled in the United States, utilizing both domestic and imported components.\u00a0Due to the belief that domestically manufactured and assembled\u00a0products are of superior quality, a recent survey noted that more than 83% of consumers are willing to pay a premium of up to 20% for such items. This label is a validation of Worksport\u2019s strategic acquisition of a U.S. manufacturing facility in West Seneca, New York and the recent relocation of its headquarters to the same facility. By centralizing production, management and quality control, Worksport is more than equipped to guarantee consistent product quality while also achieving greater operational efficiency. While the Tesla Cybertruck is due to finally hit the road this year, Worksport\u2019s solar-powered technology will give electric pickups a big boost as it is able to extend the range of the vehicle, an issue that is being addressed to widen EV adoptability.\n\nBNEF Forecasted An Impressive US EV Trajectory\n\nWith the incentives of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), to portion of EVs in passenger vehicle sales is expected to grow from 2022\u2019s 7.6% to nearly 28% by 2026.\u00a0BloombergNEF\u2019s projection is about\u00a020% off from the Biden administration\u2019s goal for EVs to make up half of vehicles sold in the country by the end of the decade, but the goal is said to be potentially reachable within four years of additional growth.\n\nAs for the global figures, EV sales are expected to expand from 2022\u2019s 10.5 million to almost 27 million in 2026, with EV share in global automotive sales growing from 2022\u2019s 14% to 30% in 2026. When looking at specific markets, EVs are estimated to account for half of vehicles sales in China while reaching a 42% share in Europe by that time.\n\nThe EV Future Relies On A\u00a0Combination Of Factors...\n\nThe realization of BNEF\u2019s optimistic forecast depends on a variety of factors besides the actual model of electric vehicles, such as the support in the form of policies, improvements in battery technology, the development of the charging infrastructure, etc. Tesla is working hard to deliver its battery promise but it still hasn\u2019t reported any significant progress while at the beginning of the month, Toyota Motor (NYSE: TM) claimed it achieved a significant breakthrough in solid battery development that will halve the battery\u2019s size, weight and price. One thing is certain, whoever makes such technological advancements will not only be able to catch up to the EV king himself, Tesla, but also significantly speed up EV progress. Worksport\u2019s intellectual portfolio certainly qualifies this revolutionary automotive parts company to enter the EV game.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

The highest-end version of the EV truck, the Platinum Extended Range F-150 Lightning, was reduced by $6,000 to $91,995.\n\nThe Lightning pickup truck has encountered its fair share of problems. Shipments of the EV truck were halted earlier this year due to 'battery issues.' We shared footage of the EV fire that prompted Ford to stop production for nearly a month.\n\nMarin Gjaja, chief customer officer of Ford's electric-vehicle business, told WSJ that supply chain issues and rising material costs had driven the cost of the EV truck up over the last year. Ford has raised the MSRP of its EV trucks multiple times in the last year (read:\u00a0here & here). The carmaker appears to be sacrificing margins to compete with Tesla amid the price war.\n\nWSJ noted:\n\nThe move comes after Tesla -- which had a 60% US market share in electric vehicles this year through June, according to Motor Intelligence -- reported a surge in second-quarter deliveries that was helped by sharp price cuts and discounts rolled out earlier this year. Also over the weekend, Tesla began production of its Cybertruck nearly four years after the prototype was introduced.\n\nEarlier this year, Ford cut Mustang Mach-E electric SUV prices after Tesla lowered its Model Y price.\n\nIn January, we were among the first to note that Tesla's\u00a0weaponization of price cuts was a move to crush EV competition.\n\nFord shares are down about 1% in premarket trading in New York following the news of price cuts.\n\nPerhaps the price cuts also suggest demand issues...\n\nBy Zerohedge.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:\n\nRussia To Overtake Saudi Arabia As The Largest OPEC+ Oil Producer Germany\u2019s Onshore Wind Power Additions Not Enough To Meet 2030 Targets Corruption Continues To Plague Mexico\u2019s State-Owned Oil Company\n\nRead this article on OilPrice.com", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-slashes-f-150-lightning-160000147.html", "symbols": ["F.MX", "F.US", "FDMO34.SA", "FMC1.F", "FMC1.XETRA", "TL0.F", "TL0.XETRA", "TSLA.MX", "TSLA.US", "TSLA34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": -0.853, "neg": 0.077, "neu": 0.878, "pos": 0.044}}, {"date": "2023-07-18T15:56:56+00:00", "title": "Goldman Sachs, Netflix reports, Tesla earnings: 3 things to watch", "content": "Investing.com -- Stocks drove higher on Tuesday after mostly positive earnings reports from big banks.\n\nAs earnings continue to pour out this week from S&P 500 companies, investors will get to hear from executives about business and consumer spending trends.

Consumer prices and producer prices for June showed inflation cooling at a faster-than-expected pace, stoking hopes that the Fed would reach the end of its interest rate increases sooner rather than later.\n\nTech stocks have gotten a lift in recent days on those hopes.

These problems, along with numerous other concerns related to powertrain, suspension, structural integrity, and sealing, have caused preproduction Cybertruck prototypes to fall behind schedule.\n\nDon\u2019t Miss:\n\nUntil 2016 it was illegal for retail investors to invest in high-growth startups.

The suspension system was another area of concern, with the prototype Cybertruck falling significantly short of the targets set in this aspect.\n\nEven though Tesla has faced some production delays over the years, it has achieved success by producing the best-selling vehicle worldwide with its Model Y.\n\nExperts interviewed by Wired expressed surprise at the extent of the issues encountered by the prototype at such an advanced stage. One expert, who requested anonymity because of concerns about backlash from fervent Tesla supporters, stated, \"My first reaction is I am astounded. These are classic mechanical automotive engineering challenges that you have in pretty much any vehicle. I'm blown away that they would be struggling so much with the basics.\"\n\nDespite the impressive number of preorders for the Cybertruck, industry experts and analysts, including Morgan Stanley, remain skeptical, viewing it as a niche product that may struggle to compete with mainstream pickup trucks.\n\nAccording to a survey conducted by AmericanTrucks.com, more than 25% of the participants expressed their intention to purchase a Cybertruck. When asked about their top choice among trucks, the Tesla Cybertruck ranked second, narrowly trailing behind the Ford F-150 Lightning.\n\nAs of now, the Cybertruck has not been assigned an official price or release date. But with the latest revelations about the prototype's significant shortcomings, doubts persist regarding when the eagerly awaited electric pickup will become available to customers.\n\nSee more on startup investing from Benzinga:\n\nDon\u2019t just buy from your favorite brands, own them so you own the upside.

This weekend\u2019s news that Giga Austin built its first production Cybertruck gave the stock a boost on Monday.\n\nOver the last three months, Tesla stock has jumped a whopping 58%, adding over $100 in share price for investors riding the boom. With that in mind, Wall Street is expecting Tesla to report top-line revenue of $24.56 billion, and adjusted EPS of $0.82. That revenue figure would represent a slight gain from Q1, but a massive 45% from a year ago.\n\nIn terms of profitability, Tesla is expected to report adjusted net income of $2.89 billion, slightly less Q1\u2019s $2.9 billion, but nearly $300 million more than a year ago.\n\nEarlier this month Tesla reported Q2 global production of 479,700 units, with deliveries of 466,140. The delivery figure easily topped Wall Street consensus estimates of 448,599 units, as well as the prior quarter\u2019s total of 422,875. Both production and delivery totals for the second quarter were all-time records for Tesla.\n\nConcerns about demand in Q1 seem to have been addressed by Tesla\u2019s strong delivery numbers for Q2. Aside from growing volume and product updates on vehicles like the Cybertruck and upcoming gen-3 platform, in the near term analysts are also laser-focused on gross margin.

BROWN/AFP via Getty Images)\n\n\u201cWe believe the line in the sand is Auto GM (ex credits) of ~17.5% with [Q2] being the trough quarter for Tesla GM that should ramp back over the coming quarters and back towards the 20% level heading into 2024,\u201d Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note to investors on Monday. Tesla reported auto GM (gross margin) of 19% in Q1, and GAAP gross margin of 19.3%, down from Q4\u2019s 24%.\n\nSteep price cuts in Q1 took their toll on Tesla\u2019s margins last quarter, but analysts like Ives and others believe Q2 likely be the \u201ctrough\u201d for Tesla\u2019s margin dip.\n\n\u201cWe join a consensus view that Q2 will be a trough in auto gross margin,\u201d Jefferies analyst Philippe Houchois wrote last week, adding that the Jefferies team noted a \u201cshift\u201d in valuation drivers, notably based on Tesla's lead in AI-based self-driving software. The themes of gross margin bottoming and the realization that AI was fueling Tesla\u2019s recent run-up were also noted by both Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, though those banks as well as Jefferies feel that a re-rating of the stock on those themes is unwarranted at this time.\n\nHouchois believes product refreshes, like the much-rumored Model 3 \u201cHighland\u201d version, and Tesla\u2019s small share overall of the mid-size car segment means there\u2019s still room to grow despite price cuts.\n\nLooking further ahead to the post-earnings conference call, investors and analysts will be waiting to hear more on Cybertruck production and whether first deliveries are still slated for end of Q3 and any new information on product refreshes. Possible concern over the Cybertruck\u2019s nearing production may have prompted Ford to slash prices on Monday for its F-150 Lighting EV.\n\nAlso in focus will be Tesla\u2019s expansion plans in countries like India and France, where the company has had recent discussions with local governments. In addition, the Wall Street Journal reported this week that Tesla was seeking to double the footprint of its Giga Berlin plant.\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Prices for the F-150 Lightning Pro base model have been slashed by 17%, from $59,974 to $49,995. Pricing on its Platinum model has been cut by $6000, from $98,074 to $91,995.\n\nFord's price-slashing strategy, however, was not met with much optimism. The company\u2019s shares took a 5.94% hit yesterday to close the session at $14.09 per share as investors worried over the impact this price cut might have on profits.\n\nAt current price levels, Ford trades at 8.01X forward earnings, which is significantly below its decade-long high of 81.99X and just slightly above the median of 7.57X.Shares are trading intriguingly below the industry\u2019s 42.43X forward earnings and also beneath the S&P 500\u2019s average of 19.9X. Even with respect to P/S metric, F appears quite undervalued. The stock is currently trading at 0.35X forward 12-month sales, below 2.01X for the Zacks sub-industry, 1X for the Zacks sector and 3.85X for the S&P 500 index.\n\nSo, should you consider parking your cash at Ford given the attractive valuation metrics? Before that, let\u2019s delve deeper into Ford\u2019s latest price-cut strategy and its potential impact on the stock.\n\nBehind Ford\u2019s Bold Move\n\nWhile Ford's latest price cuts are an attempt to strengthen its position in the market, investors have reacted negatively. But a few analysts also argue that this move mirrors Tesla's TSLA successful playbook of starting with higher prices and gradually reducing them as economies of scale are achieved. Tesla's pricing strategies have consistently applied pressure on other manufacturers in the EV space, forcing companies like Ford to reassess their pricing models to stay competitive.\n\nFord's ability to cut prices significantly can be attributed to lower battery costs and economies of scale. The automaker states that it has more room for price adjustments due to these factors. Last year's price hikes were largely driven by high commodity costs and supply crunch. Now, with improved cost efficiencies, Ford is better-positioned to offer more competitive prices and attract a wider consumer base.\n\nWhile the company's decision reverses about half of the price hikes it imposed over the past year, it still positions the electric version of F-150 \u2014 the bestselling vehicle in the United States \u2014 at a price point considerably above its gasoline counterpart.\n\nThe price cuts are meant to preempt intensifying competition from General Motors\u2019 GM electric GMC Hummer and Chevrolet Silverado as well as Tesla's Cybertruck. Just a couple of days back, Tesla announced that it built its first Cybertruck, signaling its entry into the e-pickup market. Ford is preparing itself for a market wherein a competitive price point might be the defining factor in consumer choice.\n\nIn addition to price reductions, Ford has introduced new incentives to further stimulate sales. The company now offers a $1,000 discount for customers who configure their truck online, along with favorable financing options at a low rate of 1.9% for 36 months. These incentives aim to entice potential buyers and create a more appealing value proposition for F-150 Lightning.\n\nIn line with the pricing changes, Ford has also announced plans to increase its production capacity. It has temporarily shut down its Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Michigan to expand production of F-150 Lightning models to 150,000 vehicles annually starting this fall.\n\nImpact on Ford\u2019s Financials & Implications on the EV Market\n\nWhile these price cuts may create uncertainty around CEO Jim Farley's goal of an 8% return on Ford\u2019s EV business by the end of 2026, Ford is banking on the long-term effects of this strategic move. Notably, Ford has already projected a $3 billion loss in its EV unit this year. While near-term margins may be negatively impacted by the price cut, the auto giant aims to improve its margins as it scales up its electric offerings and relies on volume sales to compensate for the decreased prices.\n\nFord's price cuts on the electric F-150, along with the introduction of Tesla's Cybertruck and the forthcoming electric version of GM\u2019s Chevrolet Silverado, highlight the rapidly evolving EV market. Lowering prices and increasing competition among automakers will eventually benefit consumers by providing more choices and encouraging greater price competitiveness.\n\nFor consumers, the price reduction might be a welcome change. The electric version of the F-150, previously priced akin to luxury vehicles, may now seem more affordable. The reduced prices of Ford's Lightning models could make them eligible for the $7,500 tax credit under President Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, further incentivizing consumer adoption of electric vehicles.\n\nAs pointed out by Brian Moody from Kelley Blue Book, the barrier to EV ownership has primarily been their high prices. These cuts might open up new opportunities for potential buyers and further accelerate EV adoption.\n\nBuy Ford Now\n\nFord is a solid bet for several reasons, especially if you have a long-term horizon. The company boasts a strong vehicle mix, including popular models such as the F-series trucks, Maverick pickup, and a range of SUVs, including Escape, Explorer, Expedition, EcoSport, and Edge. The company\u2019s robust lineup of electric vehicles, including the Mustang Mach-E, E-Transit and F-150 Lightning, is further bolstering deliveries.\n\nFord's aggressive electrification efforts, outlined in its Ford+ plan, have positioned it well for long-term growth. With a planned investment of around $50 billion by 2026 and a target production of more than 2 million EVs by the end of that year, Ford is set to solidify its position in the booming EV landscape.\n\nFurthermore, Ford Pro, with its strong order books and successful product launches, is poised for significant growth in the future. Ford's ample liquidity, investor-friendly moves, and commitment to shareholder returns through dividend reinstatement demonstrate its efforts toward achieving financial stability and generating value for investors.\n\nWhile the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Ford\u2019s 2023 earnings currently suggests a 5% year-over-year decline, the company is seeing northbound estimate revisions. So, there could be a change in this situation. The 2023 and 2024 EPS estimate has increased 4 cents and 3 cents, respectively, in the past 30 days. Notably, Ford has grown its earnings over 3.1% in the last five years and is expected to grow at least 6% in the next five years.\n\nF currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and has a Value Score of A.

Let\u2019s take a closer look at its fundamentals ahead of the earnings release.\r\n\r\nTesla stock has risen about 61% so far this year, outperforming the Zacks industry average growth of 50.4%. The outperformance is likely to continue, given that Tesla has a reasonable chance of beating estimates this quarter (see: all the Alternative Energy ETFs here).\r\n\r\nThis has put the ETFs having a substantial allocation to this luxury carmaker like Direxion Daily TSLA Bull 1.5X Shares TSLL, MeetKevin Pricing Power ETF PP, Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund XLY, ARK Autonomous Technology & Robotics ETF ARKQ, and Vanguard Consumer Discretionary ETF VCR in focus ahead of Q2 earnings.\n\nEarnings Whispers\n\nTesla has an Earnings ESP of +2.97% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). According to our methodology, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 increases the chances of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\r\n\r\nThe electric carmaker saw a positive earnings estimate revision of 3 cents over the past 30 days for the to-be-reported quarter. Analysts increasing estimates right before earnings \u2014 with the most up-to-date information possible \u2014 is a good indicator for the stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter indicates substantial year-over-year earnings growth of 9.2% and revenue growth of 46.9%.\r\n\r\nFurther, the earnings track record of the company is robust. It delivered a four-quarter average earnings surprise of 11.71%.\r\n\r\nTesla has a top Growth Score of A but belongs to a top-ranked Zacks industry (in the top 14%). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the average target price is $231.22, with nearly 32% of the analysts giving a Strong Buy or a Buy rating ahead of the company\u2019s earnings.\n\nNew Q2 Deliveries Record\n\nEarlier this month, Tesla reported record deliveries for the second quarter of 2023, signaling its growing dominance in the electric vehicle market as the company continues to expand its production and sales globally (read: Tesla Sets New Q2 Delivery Record: ETFs to Buy).\r\n\r\nThe leading electric carmaker delivered a record 466,140 (446,915 Model 3 and Y and 19,225 Model S and X) cars worldwide in the second quarter, up 83% from the year-ago quarter and 10% from the prior quarter. The electric carmaker produced a record 479,700 (460,211 Model 3 and Y, and 19,489 Model S and X) vehicles during the quarter.\r\n\r\nWith this, Tesla delivered a total of 888,000 vehicles during the first half of 2023 and is on track to achieve its guidance of 1.8 million vehicles for 2023.\n\nTesla Reveals New Models\n\nAfter two years of delay, the carmaker rolled out its first electric pickup -- a slick-looking silver Cybertruck -- at its huge plant near Austin, TX. Tesla will be making three models of the Cybertruck, a vehicle that can accelerate from zero to 60 miles per hour (100 kilometers per hour) in less than three seconds. The basic model will cost $39,900 (roughly Rs. 32,03,700) and offer a 250-mile range between charges. The top-line truck will have twice that range and sell for $69,900 (roughly Rs. 57,41,900).\r\n\r\nThe pickup is expected to bring the automaker into another profitable EV segment in the United States.\n\nETFs to Watch\n\nDirexion Daily TSLA Bull 1.5X Shares (TSLL)\r\n\r\nWith AUM of $984.7 million, Direxion Daily TSLA Bull 1.5X Shares is just an 11-month-old ETF and is by far the largest U.S.-listed single-stock ETF on the market today.

That is, it won\u2019t happen anytime soon. In fact, lithium producers just warned\u00a0global supplies may not meet electric vehicle demand at all. That\u2019s creating a big opportunity for lithium stocks.\n\nIt\u2019s why major automakers, like General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Ford (NYSE:F) recently secured lithium supply deals with Albemarle (NYSE:ALB) and Lithium Americas (NYSE:LAC). To keep up with demand, every existing producer supplying the market today must double output every two to three years for the next decade, Albemarle once said.\n\nAlso, According to Fastmarkets, there were 45 operating lithium mines last year with 11 expected to open this year and seven next year. This pace is, however, far from adequate when compared to the outsized global demand.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSo, which lithium stocks should we buy and hold for the long term?\n\nAlbemarle (ALB) Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com\n\nEvery time Albemarle pulls back, buy it. In fact, when it has dipped, I typically highlight it on these pages. For example, on May 5, it dipped to about $180 before testing $220. Then, it dropped to $195.54, which we highlighted again on June 6. From there, it almost hit our target price of $250. Having said that, it is pulling back again.\n\nHelping, UBS analysts just upgraded the stock to a buy rating, with a price target of $225. Even Benchmark just said ALB is the best \u201cgrowth opportunity.\u201d All with ALB sales expected to grow about 12% a year between now and 2025, with EV growth and all things green. Plus, with all things green likely to push lithium consumption even higher, it should strongly support ALB earnings growth, and send its stock to higher highs.\n\nLivent Corp. (LTHM) Livent Corporation logo on a phone screen. LTHM stock.\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nLivent Corp. (NYSE:LTHM) has been incredibly explosive for us. The last time we featured the LTHM stock, it traded at $22.75 on May 5. Today, it\u2019s up to $28.32 and could push even higher.\n\nFor one, it just posted an EPS of 60 cents on $235.5 million in sales. Even better, LTHM raised its full-year guidance. It now expects its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to fall between $530 million and $600 million. That\u2019s well above prior EBITDA guidance for $510 million to $530 million.\n\nSecondly, Livent and Allkem Ltd. will combine in an all-stock $10.6 billion deal by year-end. Under the deal, Livent shareholders will receive 2.406 shares in the combined firm for each share. Even better, the tie-up between these two will create the third-largest lithium producer in the world, and should benefit from tight supply and strong demand. There\u2019s plenty of long-term growth ahead for these merging companies.\n\nAmplify Lithium & Battery Technology ETF (BATT) Graphic of Lithium scientific symbol (Li) in the shape of a big white gear with construction equipment and mountain around it\n\nSource: GrAl / Shutterstock.com\n\nYou could also look to diversify, at a relatively low cost, with an exchange-traded fund such as the Amplify Lithium & Battery Technology ETF(NYSEARCA:BATT). With an expense ratio of 0.59%, the BATT ETF provides exposure to global companies deriving material revenue from developing, producing, and using lithium battery technology.\n\nSome of its top holdings include\u00a0Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Albemarle (NYSE:ALB), Sociedad Quimica (NYSE:SQM),\u00a0and Panasonic (OTCMKTS:PCRFY). Even better, over the last few months, the BATT ETF exploded from a low of about $11.80 in March to a recent high of $13.99. Moving forward, given the lithium supply-demand situation, I\u2019d like to see the BATT ETF closer to $17.50 again. It last hit that price in early 2022.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Cooper\u00a0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the\u00a0InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nIan Cooper, a contributor to InvestorPlace.com, has been analyzing stocks and options for web-based advisories since 1999.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nBuy This $5 Stock BEFORE This Apple Project Goes Live Wall Street Titan: Here\u2019s My #1 Stock for 2023 The $1 Investment You MUST Take Advantage of Right Now It doesn\u2019t matter if you have $500 or $5 million.

Many of them say they apply the same train of thought and analysis in picking winning stocks \u2014 stocks they will never be selling.\n\nGOBankingRates spoke to a few of them who explained why they won\u2019t let go of these.\n\nApple\n\nJoe Camberato, CEO of National Business Capital, became a self-made millionaire in his 30s thanks to hard work as an entrepreneur founding a fintech lending platform, as well as numerous other companies and investments.\n\nCamberato said one of the stocks he will never sell is Apple.\n\n\u201cApple is an extraordinary company that has become deeply rooted in our lives. With a massive fan base and a consistent track record of innovation, Apple has established itself as one of the world\u2019s finest companies \u2014 a true profit-generating machine,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cIn my view, the best is yet to come for Apple. Also, the fact that it pays dividends allows me to reinvest them and buy more shares, and that strengthens my position.\u201d\n\nShares of Apple are up 51.7% year-to-date, as of July 13.\n\nI\u2019m a Self-Made Millionaire: These Are the 6 Investments Everyone Should Make During an Economic Downturn\n\nVanguard Index Funds, Including Small Cap, Growth and S&P 500\n\nRegarding the Vanguard index funds, Camberato said they provide a convenient avenue for diversifying across the top companies in the S&P 500, as well as high-growth potential stocks in the growth and small cap index funds.\n\n\u201cThese indexes have demonstrated remarkable long-term growth and consistently pay dividends. By looking at how they performed historically, stretching back to the 1920s, it\u2019s clear that the S&P has endured periods of pullbacks, but ultimately they continued to thrive, generating impressive returns over time. It would go against logic to sell these index funds,\u201d he said.\n\nIn addition, he noted that even during market crashes, his strategy would be to continue monthly investments in the indexes, and possibly even increase the amount during downturns.\n\n\u201cSelling these stocks would mean selling myself short and missing out on their long-term potential,\u201d he added.\n\nTesla\n\nAnna Koval is a self-made millionaire who is the co-founder and CMO at Tarotoo, an online tarot reading platform launched in 2017 with a partner and their savings.\n\nShe said that one of the most important lessons she learned is to invest in what you know and love.\n\n\u201cFor me, that means investing in companies that are aligned with my values, passions, and vision for the future,\u201d Koval said.\n\nHence, she won\u2019t be selling Tesla, which \u201cis not just a car company.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pioneer in clean energy, autonomous driving and battery technology. I admire how Tesla challenges the status quo and pushes the boundaries of what\u2019s possible. I own a Tesla Model 3 and I love it. It\u2019s the best car I\u2019ve ever driven. I believe Tesla has a lot of growth potential and will continue to revolutionize the world for the better,\u201d she said.\n\nShares of Tesla are up a whopping 151.6% year-to-date, as of July 13.\n\nShopify\n\nShopify is another stock Koval said she wouldn\u2019t sell.\n\n\u201cOnce again, Shopify is not just a platform for online stores. It\u2019s a partner for entrepreneurs, creators, and innovators,\u201d she said. \u201cI admire how Shopify empowers millions of people to start and grow their own businesses online. I use Shopify to run Tarotoo\u2019s website and e-commerce operations. It\u2019s easy, reliable, and scalable. I believe Shopify has a lot of growth potential and will continue to support the future of commerce.\u201d\n\nShares of Shopify are up 84.8% year-to-date, as of July 13.\n\nAmazon\n\nCasey Jones, founder and head of finance at CJ&CO, a global digital marketing agency, said that as a self-made millionaire and a seasoned investor, he has learned that the key to building wealth is patience, diversification and investing in companies that have a proven track record and a clear vision for the future.\n\nIn turn, that\u2019s why he has decided to hold onto and never sell Amazon.\n\nFirst, Jones said that Amazon is a diversified technology giant with a leading market share in multiple industries, including e-commerce, cloud computing, digital advertising and artificial intelligence.\n\n\u201cThis diversification provides a level of stability and growth potential that is hard to find in other companies,\u201d Jones said.\n\nIn addition, Jones said Amazon has shown resilience and growth potential despite facing challenges in recent years.\n\n\u201cThe company\u2019s stock has experienced significant declines in the past but has managed to recover and continue growing. This resilience is a testament to Amazon\u2019s strong business model and its ability to adapt to changing market conditions,\u201d he added.\n\nFinally, he said that the long-term growth prospects for Amazon remain strong due to its innovative approach and ability to adapt to changing market conditions.\n\n\u201cThe company\u2019s continuous investment in new technologies and sectors, such as artificial intelligence and healthcare, positions it well for future growth,\u201d Jones said.\n\nAs of today, his initial investment of 1,000 AUD ($685) in Amazon has grown significantly.\n\nJones noted, however, that it\u2019s important to note that investing in stocks always carries risks.\n\n\u201cIndividual investors should carefully consider their financial goals and risk tolerance before making any investment decisions,\u201d he said.\n\nShares of Amazon are up 52.4% year-to-date, as of July 13.\n\nMore From GOBankingRates\n\nI'm a Real Estate Agent: Buy Real Estate in These 5 Countries To Be Rich in 10 Years Costco's 7 Best Premade Meals To Save You Money 3 Ways to Recession Proof Your Retirement Take our poll: How will you achieve your financial goals?\n\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: I\u2019m a Self-Made Millionaire: Here Are 5 Stocks I\u2019m Never Selling", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/m-self-made-millionaire-5-110020385.html", "symbols": ["307.F", "GSPC.INDX", "SHOP.TO", "SHOP.US", "TL0.F", "TL0.XETRA", "TSLA.MX", "TSLA.US", "TSLA34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 1, "neg": 0.016, "neu": 0.788, "pos": 0.196}}, {"date": "2023-07-18T10:38:42+00:00", "title": "Sinking Shares: Why These 3 Growth Stocks Are No Longer Worth Holding", "content": "Stocks, much like all of life, are very dynamic. As companies\u2019 offerings and macro environments change, the attractiveness of their stocks fluctuates. And, of course, valuations play a massive role in the attractiveness of stocks. A stock that was a great buy when its forward price-earnings ratio was 20 will, all things being equal, not be beautiful after its forward P/E ratio has zoomed up to 60 in a relatively short amount of time. This has led to the rise of growth stocks to sell.\n\nBecause growth stocks tend to surge that way, such names are particularly susceptible to quickly going from \u201cbuys\u201d to \u201csells.\u201d With all of that in mind, here are three growth names that were once, in my view, great buys but now have become growth stocks to sell.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) supercharging station during the day.\n\nSource: Arina P Habich / Shutterstock.com\n\nAt the end of 2022 and the beginning of this year, when Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) was trading at around $120, I was a big fan of TSLA stock. I viewed worries about Elon Musk\u2019s controversial free-speech policies at Twitter as overdone. I also thought that the Street was overly concerned about the price cuts that the automaker was implementing. The market was undervaluing the company, given its very powerful brand name and rapidly growing top and bottom lines. It\u2019s a classic case of one of those growth stocks to sell.\n\nBut I\u2019ve always realized that the electric-vehicle maker has significant weaknesses and threats. Specifically, its EVs reportedly often require major repairs, and it\u2019s facing significantly increased competition in all its major markets. Further, its advanced driver assistance offering has always been widely criticized, and its upcoming Cybertruck is so unorthodox that it may not appeal to many consumers.\n\nMoreover, TSLA stock, trading around $280, has more than doubled from its lows. And now has a vast forward-price-earnings ratio of 82. Given these points, I view TSLA as one of the growth stocks to sell.\n\nStarbucks (SBUX) Starbucks\n\nSource: \u00a9iStock.com/garett_mosher\n\nBack in 2012, I viewed Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) stock as a great opportunity. The shares had rebounded greatly from their huge decline during the Great Financial Crisis but were still way below their all-time highs. Moreover, the shares were not rising very much due to worries about the company\u2019s competition, doubts about the strength of the U.S. economy, and theories that the firm had saturated its market in the U.S. and Europe.\n\nBut I was upbeat about\u00a0 Starbucks\u2019 opportunities in China and the efforts it was making to improve its food offerings and start serving alcohol. (I\u2019m not sure what wound up happening with that particular effort). As with Tesla years later, I thought the market was greatly undervaluing the firm\u2019s strong brand name. As a result, I bought Starbucks stock in 2012 and made some money from it, but I sold it in 2016 when its CEO and founder, Howard Schultz announced in late 2016 that he would resign.\n\nNow, however, I view the work-from-home trend and stepped-up competition from Luckin Coffee (OTC:LKNCY) in China and Dutch Bros (NYSE:BROS) in the U.S. as major threats to the firm. As a result, although I\u2019m hopeful that SBUX\u2019s CEO can turn around the company, I would not advise owning SBUX stock at this point and view it as one of the growth stocks to sell.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nI\u2019ve been bullish on McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) for many years, citing the fast food company\u2019s appealing offerings, incredibly powerful brand name, and rapid growth.\n\nHowever, amid irrational fears about a U.S. recession, the valuation of MCD stock has become far too high.\u00a0 Specifically, the shares now have a trailing price-earnings ratio of 31. I believe the valuation is over the top for a well-established company that will never deliver explosive growth.\n\nFinally, I believe that McDonald\u2019s will encounter greatly steeped up competition from Restaurant Brands International\u2019s (NYSE:QSR) Burger King. QSR has delivered strong growth in recent quarters and last year \u201chired former\u00a0Domino\u2019s (NYSE:DPZ) CEO Patrick Doyle as its executive chairman.\u201d Doyle did a great job of turning around Domino\u2019s and could very well do the same for Burger King.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer\u2019s wife was long LKNCY.

TSLA, Meet Kevin Pricing Power ETF PP, Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund XLY, Fidelity MSCI Consumer Discretionary Index ETF FDIS and ARK Autonomous Technology & Robotics ETF ARKQ.\n\nHere are highlights from Monday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\nETFs in Focus on Tesla's Major Rally: Will It Last?\n\nThe electric vehicle giant Tesla Inc. has proven to be a super stock this year, having surged 128.4% (as of Jul 14, 2023). Since analysts are busy deciding whether this rally will continue, let\u2019s delve deeper into this company and its stock.\n\nInvestors should note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the average target price is $231.22, with the highest being $305 and the lowest being $85. The stock had a price of $281.35 as of Jul 14, 2023.\n\nTesla Sets New Q2 Delivery Record\n\nIn early July, Tesla announced a record number of deliveries for the second quarter of 2023. The figures exceed expectations and signal its growing dominance in the electric vehicle market as the company continues to expand its production and sales globally.\n\nThe record-breaking numbers were driven by the Model 3 and Model Y, which together accounted for approximately 96% of the total deliveries. Tesla's sales and deliveries have also been bolstered by the recovery of Model S and Model X since their product refresh two years ago.\n\nFirst Cybertruck on a Roll\n\nAfter two years of delays, the electric-vehicle marker built its first Cybertruck at its plant in Austin, TX. Tesla will be making three models of the Cybertruck, a vehicle that can accelerate from zero to 60 miles per hour in less than three seconds.\n\nTesla\u2019s Back-to-Back Price Cut Strategy Works in Its Favor\n\nTesla delivered a record number of vehicles in the three months ended June, after cutting prices to boost sales. It means that its price-cut strategy has excelled. TSLA has slashed prices in markets including the United States, the UK and China to gain an edge over rivals.\n\nWhat\u2019s in Store This Earnings Season?\n\nTesla is set to release its second-quarter earnings on Jul 19, 2023, after market close. Currently, TSLA has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an Earnings ESP of +2.97%. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nAccording to our methodology, the combination of a positive\u00a0Earnings ESP\u00a0and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 increases the chances of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our\u00a0Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nThis electric car maker saw upward earnings estimate revision over the past 30 and 60 days for the to-be-released quarter. Four out of 11 analysts raised their estimates. Tesla\u2019s current quarter earnings estimate is 83 cents, up by three cents over the past month.\n\nThe company beat earnings estimates in the trailing four reported quarters, yielding an average earnings surprise of 11.71%. Tesla is expected to post earnings and revenue growth of 9.21% and 46.95%, respectively, for the to-be-reported quarter.\n\nWhat Do Analysts Say?\n\nOut of 25 analysts who conferred ratings on Tesla, 28% gave a Strong But Rating and four gave a Buy rating. As many as 14 analysts gave the stock a Hold rating, while only three analysts went for a Sell recommendation.\n\nWhat Does Technical Analysis Say?\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, Tesla was at 281.38 as on Jul 14, 2023, comfortably above its 10-day, 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages of 274.57, 223.95 and 204.28, respectively, at the time of writing. The rise of the 50-day moving average above the 200-day moving average is known as a golden cross, which implies bullish sentiment.\n\nETFs in Focus\n\nAgainst this backdrop, if you have faith in Tesla, you may track Tesla-heavy ETFs like Meet Kevin Pricing Power ETF, Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund, Fidelity MSCI Consumer Discretionary Index ETF and ARK Autonomous Technology & Robotics ETF.\n\nWant key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?\n\nZacks\u2019 free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.\n\nGet it free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

He was immediately taken with Tesla\u2019s vision and by 27 managed to convince his colleagues at Jennison to gamble on the stock.\n\nA dozen years and some 14,800% later, Koney isn\u2019t satisfied. He still sees lots of room for additional gains as the company releases a \u201ctsunami\u201d of new cars in the coming years. At the same time, he expects the auto industry to undergo a massive consolidation as it makes the challenging shift away from combustion engines.\n\nKoney, talking for the first time publicly about how Jennison built a Tesla position now worth $5.9 billion, said the Elon Musk-led company built EV expertise early and has fine-tuned its products, positioning itself to be among the survivors. Koney thinks by 2026, Tesla could be pumping out twice the 2 million or so cars it\u2019s expected to deliver this year. That will set it up for further growth, even as dreamy notions of fully self-driving cars remain years away.\n\n\u201cThey are mostly a car company today. That\u2019s what drives the majority of their revenue,\u201d Koney said. \u201cA few years from now that will still be the case.\u201d\n\nWhen Tesla posts quarterly earnings on Wednesday, Koney won\u2019t be especially worried about the company\u2019s seemingly constant volatility. The results will be be a barometer for how well a series of price cuts are working in an increasingly crowded market, in which both legacy automakers and startups are constantly introducing alternatives to the Model 3 and Model Y, Tesla\u2019s two workhorse vehicles.\n\nKoney said he\u2019s thinking more about three years from now, when he expects next-generation Tesla cars will be rolling off a newly built assembly line in Mexico. He sees those models being made cheaply at high volumes, putting investors like Jennison in line for another Musk windfall.\n\nRead More: Tesla Tests the Limits of Elon Musk\u2019s Minimal Model Strategy\n\nChance Meeting\n\nKoney had no real background in the auto industry when he first encountered Tesla. He was born in Ghana and spent part of his childhood in Gambia. His father was a judge, and his mom worked for Ghana Airways. After studying economics and political science at Williams College, he got his first job in finance as an aerospace analyst at UBS Group AG.\n\nJennison, an affiliate manager of PGIM with about $175 billion under management, hired Koney in 2007 to cover the industrial sector. Two years later, the analyst embarked on a nationwide tour of the EV ecosystem to understand why one of the companies he followed, Johnson Controls Inc., was considering building a lithium-ion battery business. One of the startups he visited impressed him so much he began forming a whole new investment idea.\n\nWhen Koney met with Tesla at its retail store in Silicon Valley, Deepak Ahuja, Tesla\u2019s then-chief financial officer, said the company would first break into the market at the high end, where consumers were willing to pay a premium for an EV. Then they would drive downmarket as quickly as possible, increasing volume and lowering the price of each successive model.\n\nKoney came away bullish, but Tesla still faced a lot of risks. He kept a close watch on the company as it gained a stronger footing. In April 2010, the carmaker received a low-interest $465 million loan from the US Department of Energy \u2014 a lifeline as it was creating the Model S. A month later, Tesla bought a shuttered factory once owned by a joint venture between General Motors and Toyota Motor Corp. That June, Tesla went public at $17 a share, valuing the company at about $1.7 billion.\n\nKoney met more executives, including its then-chief technology officer, JB Straubel, and its head designer, Franz von Holzhausen. By 2011, convinced Tesla was \u201cfor real,\u201d it was time for him to pitch Jennison on the idea.\n\n\u201cOwuraka believed that Tesla was going to revolutionize the auto industry,\u201d said Kathleen McCarragher, head of growth equity at Jennison. \u201cHe had a deep understanding of the significance of Tesla\u2019s competitive advantages.\u201d\n\nAmong the factors Koney highlighted to the team was that Tesla had created its own battery system, had structural cost advantages compared to traditional automakers and had a \u201cunique company culture that could create innovative solutions,\u201d McCarragher said.\n\nJennison owns more than 20 million Tesla shares, making it one of the company\u2019s largest investors. The asset manager declined to say how profitable its bet on Tesla has been over the years, citing compliance issues. The stock has gained more than 135% in 2023 and is up 14,853% since mid-2011, when Jennison first disclosed its initial shareholding in a regulatory filing.\n\nHigh Volatility\n\nFor nearly a dozen years, Koney has ridden the waves of stomach-churning volatility, a similar experience to the other company he pegged as a potential behemoth early in his time at Jennison: Netflix Inc. Few stocks are as polarizing as Tesla, and each day begins with absorbing the news flow, checking Reddit and \u201caggressive lurking\u201d on Twitter.\n\nSome of the ups and downs have been triggered by Musk himself, and behind the scenes Koney has found himself in disagreements with the multibillionaire.\n\nIn 2016, Tesla wanted to acquire SolarCity, a rooftop solar-panel installer run by Musk\u2019s cousins. Some investors balked: Tesla was in the throes of working on the Model 3, its first mass-market car, and the deal seemed ill-timed.\n\nAs Tesla lobbied shareholders for support, the company arranged for a phone conversation between Koney and Musk. The analyst was rushing home to his infant daughter when the call from the CEO came through. His mother, who\u2019d been helping with childcare, picked up as Koney walked in the door and told him \u201cthis guy called Elon\u201d was on the phone.\n\nShareholders overwhelmingly approved the SolarCity deal; Jennison voted against it. Solar still isn\u2019t a big part of Tesla\u2019s energy business, where much of the excitement is focused on the company\u2019s Megapack batteries for utilities.\n\n\u201cI was not a fan of that deal, and I\u2019m still not,\u201d Koney said. \u201cI like Elon. But I\u2019m not a fanboy, per se. We don\u2019t just sign off on everything.\u201d\n\nBy 2018, Tesla was in a manufacturing ramp-up period so taxing and capital intensive, Musk called it \u201cproduction hell.\u201d According to the CEO\u2019s retelling, the company was weeks away from bankruptcy, and key executives quit.\n\nRead More: Hell for Elon Musk Is a Midsize Sedan\n\nThat was also the year Musk infamously tweeted that he was considering taking Tesla private at $420, and had \u201cfunding secured.\u201d Koney shot Tesla an email and was ultimately deposed by investors who sued Musk in federal court (the transcript of the analyst\u2019s deposition is sealed).\n\nEarly 2019 was equally rough: Tesla closed stores and missed delivery targets, and Ahuja left. But Koney saw the second quarter of the year as a turning point: Tesla became cash-flow positive, proving it could build the Model 3 and make money. It\u2019s still the only US company with a profitable EV business.\n\nTesla is not immune to risks. The company itself says it is highly dependent on Musk, who is also the CEO of Space Exploration Technologies Corp. In October, he acquired Twitter Inc. for $44 billion. This month, he announced the leadership team for xAI, his latest startup.\n\n\u201cElon is a big driver for Tesla\u2019s success,\u201d said Koney. \u201cThe less time he spends on Twitter and the more time he spends on Tesla, I\u2019m happy.\u201d\n\nRead More: Tesla Skeptics Push Back After Sizzling $500 Billion Rally\n\nFull Self-Driving\n\nIn March, Tesla gave a lengthy investor presentation at the company\u2019s headquarters and factory in Austin, and Musk shared the stage with several other executives. Koney was there in person, paying close attention to the more than 160 slides that Tesla showed.\n\nBesides the breadth of executive talent, Koney\u2019s biggest takeaway was the \u201cunboxed\u201d assembly process that Lars Moravy, Tesla\u2019s vice president of vehicle engineering, highlighted. He said the company will move away from complex and cumbersome methods the industry has used for more than a century, eliminating hundreds of parts and simplifying assembly processes. Koney believes Optimus, Tesla\u2019s humanoid robot, could ultimately be put to work on production lines to install seats and interior panels.\n\nThat could reduce costs, which would be especially helpful as Musk slashes prices of Tesla models to keep growing sales as other carmakers release waves of competing electric vehicles.\n\nWhile those cuts will pressure profit margins, Musk has said the company could make so much money on autonomous-driving software in the future, it doesn\u2019t need to make upfront returns on vehicle sales. The CEO has long made lofty claims about AI-powered cars that haven\u2019t come to pass.\n\nKoney thinks that Full Self-Driving Beta \u2014 Tesla\u2019s name for its driver-assistance software \u2014 is getting incrementally better, and requiring less input from the driver. He should know: He has a Model X with FSD Beta and regularly drives it in Manhattan.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s extremely cautious around pedestrians, which it should be,\u201d Koney said. \u201cThere\u2019s a ways to go before FSD works in a city like New York, let alone a place like Mumbai.\u201d\n\nMore bullish for Koney is the fact Tesla is building a new factory in Mexico that will make its next-generation cars.\n\nThough details are scant \u2014 vehicles were shrouded under white sheets during its investor day \u2014 Tesla expects them to be winning products. The company wants to make 20 million vehicles a year by 2030 and will need a cheaper, high-volume models to get there.\n\nIt\u2019s a far cry from 2009, when Koney was excited about the fledging EV maker but much of Wall Street questioned whether the company was viable.\n\n\u201cWhen I look at Tesla today, I\u2019m no longer worried about survival,\u201d said Koney. \u201cIt\u2019s just a question of how successful they will be.\u201d\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nNo Testing, No Inspections: Contaminated Eyedrops Blinded and Killed Americans What If the Next Big Social Media App Is ...

Similarly, the growth of the EV industry has led to a massive demand for batteries to run these EVs. Battery makers are trying to expand production to meet the rising demand and according to the International Energy Agency, the battery demand for vehicles increased by 65% in 2022 in the U.S.\n\nFurther, as per a report from McKinsey & Company, the demand for lithium-ion batteries will grow by over 30% annually by 2030. It is expected to reach a value of over $400 billion and if you want to make the most of the transition to electric, invest in battery stocks.\n\nDue to a regulatory shift towards sustainability and the higher adoption rates and demand for greener energy, the demand for batteries will be on the rise. Some of the biggest economies are seeing a massive rise in the demand for batteries. The outlook for the battery industry is positive and you can enjoy an early-mover advantage by investing in battery stocks. With that in mind, let\u2019s take a look at the three battery stocks to buy to turn your $1,000 into $1 million.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBattery Stocks: BYD Co. (BYDDY) man's hand holding wads of cash. stocks to buy. Stocks With 1000% Upside\n\nSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of my favorite battery stocks and also one of the million maker stocks is BYD Co. (OTCMKTS:BYDDF). The Chinese company isn\u2019t a pure-play battery maker but it is the second-largest battery maker currently. It has delivered the highest number of EVs and is a strong competitor to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). BYD is one name that is always on the radar for investors looking for long-term stocks. BYDFF stock is exchanging hands for $34 today and is up 34% year to date.\n\nThe company is a leader in the manufacture of rechargeable batteries which include lithium-ion batteries. With the growing adoption of EVs across the world, the demand for batteries will soar and this is when the company will benefit. To meet the growing demand, the company is planning to increase the production of Blade batteries and has invested $1.2 million in the plant. When it comes to batteries, this might only be the beginning because the world is now ready for a transition to electric and this could mean a huge demand for batteries.\n\nThat said, the company has strong financials and has sold 996, 476 cars in the first five months of 2023. It saw a whopping 411% jump in profits for the first quarter year over year. BYD entered Australia and France in the past month and is steadily expanding its global presence across different markets like Europe, Japan, and Latin America. It also introduced the Fang Cheng Bao which is an EV brand that will have off-road and SUVs. The company could be one of the largest battery manufacturers in the next few years due to the increasing EV adoption. Compared to Tesla, the stock looks much cheaper which means you can take home big gains.\n\nLithium Americas (LAC) Man holding stacks of money. Unknown Millionaire-Maker cryptos\n\nSource: Epic Cure / Shutterstock\n\nAnother top battery stock to buy, Lithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) has several business developments that will generate revenue in the coming years. The stock has moved sideways in the past few months but there is a high chance of it moving upside. LAC stock is trading at $20 today and is down close to 1.85% in the past year. On the other hand, it is up 15% year to date and once the production commences, the stock won\u2019t be this cheap. This is one of the high-return stocks to own.\n\nA strong reason behind the upside potential is the company\u2019s move to create two different entities. While Lithium Americas will focus on North America, another entity, Lithium Argentina will focus on its assets in Argentina. This decision will allow the company to make the most of its assets in both countries. That said, the company is already working on the Thacker Pass project and it has the potential to unlock after-tax net present value of $5.7 billion. As soon as production begins, we will see a solid cash flow.\n\nLastly, General Motors (NYSE:GM) has an agreement with Lithium Americas and will invest $650 million in the Thacker Pass project. With automakers planning to electrify their fleet in the coming years, there will be millions of EVs being sold and it could lead to a boost in lithium stocks. While the company doesn\u2019t generate any revenue right now, it is working on building extraction sites and has invested heavily in them. With LAC stock, the upside potential is massive but you will need patience to make the most of it.\n\nLivent Corporation (LTHM) An image of a street sign post with directions labeled \"Buy\", \"Hold\", and \"Sell\"\n\nSource: PX Media / Shutterstock\n\nLivent Corporation (NYSE:LTHM) is a company that specializes in the production and supply of lithium-based products that are suitable for companies looking for sustainable energy solutions. The company uses lithium to fill the lithium manufacturing and refining facilities across China, England, Argentina, and North America which is used to supply the EV makers. With the rise in the demand for EVs, the demand for lithium will also rise.\n\nThe merger between Livent Corporation and Allkem will make the business highly profitable. The combined net income of both companies will be $640 million and the combined revenue will be $1.7 billion. If we just look at the financials of Livent, it reported an adjusted EPS of $0.60 for the first quarter and beat analyst expectations. It also saw a 76% year-over-year growth in revenue which hit $253.5 million.\n\nAs an individual entity, Livent has already achieved significant success and demonstrated strong sales performance. But with the merger, it will become even stronger and achieve new highs. LTHM stock is trading at $28 right now and is up 49% year to date. The stock has generated close to 74% returns in the past five years.\u00a0The world needs more batteries and Livent is here to make the most of it. It has substantial upside potential from the current level.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

This certainly has investors wondering if it\u2019s time to buy stock in these market leaders with their quarterly results approaching.\n\nLet\u2019s see if now is indeed a good time to buy Tesla or Netflix stock heading into their earnings reports on Wednesday, July 19. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTesla Q2 Preview\n\nAuto giant and EV leader Tesla will be releasing its fiscal second-quarter earnings on Wednesday with EPS expected to rise 9% year over year at $0.83 per share. Sales are forecasted to climb 47% to $24.88 billion compared to $16.93 billion in the prior-year quarter.\n\nEven better, the Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction (ESP) indicates Tesla could beat earnings expectations with the Most Accurate Estimate having Q2 EPS at $0.85 per share. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nOverall, Tesla\u2019s earnings are forecasted to dip -13% in fiscal 2023 but rebound and soar 33% in FY24 at $4.70 per share. Total sales are projected to jump 23% this year and climb another 25% in FY24 to $125.81 billion. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNetflix Q2 Preview\n\nLooking at streaming giant Netflix, its fiscal second-quarter earnings are expected to dip -12% YoY at $2.82 per share compared to EPS of $3.20 in Q2 2022. This is despite sales being forecasted to rise 3% from a year ago at $8.26 billion.\n\nNotably, the Zacks ESP also indicates Netflix could beat earnings expectations with the Most Accurate Estimate having Q2 EPS at $2.88 per share and 2% above the Zacks Consensus. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAccording to Zacks estimates Netflix\u2019s annual earnings are still expected to rise 13% this year and leap another 31% in FY24 at $14.74 per share. On the top line, sales are anticipated to rise 7% in FY23 and jump another 13% in FY24 to $38.43 billion. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nP/E Valuation\n\nMonitoring valuation metrics such as price-to-earnings is still important despite the premium many big tech stocks and other industry leaders such as Tesla and Netflix are able to command this year.\n\nIn regards to a premium, Tesla stock trades at $290 a share and 79.5X forward earnings which is 35% above the Zacks Automotive-Domestic Industry average of 49.6X. Tesla trades beneath its high of 90.6X over the last year but noticeably above the median of 57.3X. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nPivoting to Netflix stock which trades at $450 a share, its P/E valuation of 39.2X forward earnings is currently below its Broadcasting Radio and Television Industry average of 49.6X. With that being said, Netflix currently trades near its high over the last year of 39.8X and above the median of 28.7X. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nAt the moment, Tesla and Netflix stock both land a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The outlook for these respective industry leaders is still intriguing but after such extensive rallies, there could be better buying opportunities ahead.\n\nTheir P/E valuations may be somewhat indicative of such but with Tesla and Netflix expected to beat earnings expectations holding on to their stocks could be rewarding from current levels especially if they can offer favorable guidance.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
