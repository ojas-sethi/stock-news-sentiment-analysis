The SEC's subpoena exceeds the agency's investigative authority, is overly burdensome and seeks \"irrelevant evidence\", Musk's lawyers said in the filing.\n\nThe SEC has said it was investigating Musk's 2022 purchases of Twitter stock and his statements and SEC filings relating to Twitter -- which Musk subsequently renamed X -- and that Musk had refused to attend a September interview for the probe.\n\nAlex Spiro, an attorney for Musk, has called the investigation \"misguided.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Spiro and Musk's other lawyers said in the filing: \"The SEC\u2019s pursuit of Mr. Musk has crossed the line into harassment\".\n\nThe SEC was not immediately available for comment. The agency\n\nhas previously said\n\nit is well within its authority to seek additional testimony from Musk and that it has received new documents in the investigation since last interviewing him.\n\nOn April 4, 2022, Musk disclosed he had acquired a 9.2% stake in Twitter. It was 11 days after the SEC's deadline for such disclosures. Musk initially said he planned to be a passive stakeholder, meaning he did not plan to take over the company.\n\nLater that month, he announced plans to buy Twitter for $44 billion. He subsequently tried to get out of the deal, alleging Twitter was not disclosing the full extent of bot activity on its platform.\n\nAfter being sued to complete the deal, Musk closed his acquisition of Twitter in late October 2022.\n\nMusk has given the SEC documents relating to the probe and provided testimony in July last year via video conference, the SEC said in a court filing. But SEC attorneys said they have more questions for Musk after seeing the documents.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe SEC has spent 18 months \"devoting its formidable resources to investigating Mr. Musk over an allegedly untimely filing,\" Thursday's filing said. \"This is just the latest chapter in a more-than-five-year saga of agency harassment against Mr. Musk and related entities.\"\n\nThe court battle is the latest flare up in the acrimonious relationship between the U.S. market regulator and Musk, the world's wealthiest person.\n\nThe SEC sued Musk in 2018 over his posts on social media saying he had \"funding secured\" to take electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc private. Musk settled, but the regulator sued him again in 2019 alleging he had violated the terms of the agreement.\n\nMusk has meanwhile accused the agency of mounting \"endless\" investigations into him and Tesla.\n\nHe said he will ask the U.S. Supreme Court to review the legality of his SEC settlement, which requires him to vet some of his social media posts with a Tesla lawyer.

It rides the wave of sustained demand for farm equipment.\n\nThe company witnessed a healthy uptick in sales, mainly in the U.S. and Canada. Large agricultural equipment sales alone are expected to climb a remarkably impressive 10% in fiscal 2023.\n\nTransitioning to the construction and forestry realms, Deere shines just as brightly. The surge in retail demand and rental re-fleeting has led to a spree of hearty shipments. Highlighting its recent triumphs, Deere\u2019s Q3 GAAP EPS of $10.20 beat market estimates by $2.02. In addition, a 12.1% revenue bump year over year (YOY) to $15.8 billion stands testament to its financial might.\n\nFurthermore, TipRanks analysts echo this bullish sentiment, presenting DE with a promising moderate buy rating. The cherry on top is an impressive 1.4% yield while trading at just 1.8 times forward sales estimates.\n\nJabil (JBL) JBL stock: the Jabil logo on the side of a building.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nJabil (NYSE:JBL), the Florida-based electronics powerhouse, continues to make major waves in the tech sphere. The stock is soaring, marking over an 80% bump in value this year alone.\n\nInterestingly, a quarter of this rally occurred after its strategic announcement in September. That plan involves selling off its mobile electronics manufacturing arm to Chinese automaker BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDY) for a whopping $2.2 billion.\n\nCollaborations with industry behemoths, including Amazon Web Services (AWS), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), are clear indicators of its upward trajectory. Diving deeper, its venture into the renewable energy arena speaks volumes of its visionary approach.\n\nMoreover, the pivot toward a consignment model, especially as it gears up for the AI server racks shipment to Amazon, bodes well for further margin improvements. And its powerful healthcare arm is not to be outdone. Fueled by partnerships with industry giants, it promises to be a revenue-generating powerhouse in the near future. JBL stock trades at around 8 times forward cash flows, 58% lower than the sector median.\n\nTEGNA (TGNA) Rack Mounted Servers In A Server Room, Server rack audio cable.

Musk backed China's inclusion in the first AI Safety Summit, hosted at Bletchley Park, England, which has drawn leading companies and nations together to agree initial steps on how to manage the risks of cutting-edge AI models.\n\n\"If the United States and the UK and China are aligned on safety, then that's going to be a good thing, because that's where the leadership is generally,\" he said.\n\nMusk, who was in May given royal-like treatment during a visit to China, welcomed that Beijing had participated in AI safety talks at the event.\n\n\"Having them here I think was essential, really. If they're not participants, it's pointless.\"\n\nSunak interviewed Musk - feted by Britain as a star guest at the two-day summit - on a small stage in a gilded room at London's Lancaster House, one of the government's most opulent venues, which is often used for diplomatic functions.\n\nSelf-confessed tech geek Sunak said he felt \"privileged and excited\" to host Musk and used the occasion to make a not-so-subtle investment pitch when the Tesla and SpaceX founder said startup firms needed high rewards to take risks in the sector.\n\n\"We very much have a tax system that supports that,\" Sunak said.\n\nMAGIC GENIE\n\nThe eclectic discussion took place in front of an invited audience of dozens of other business leaders, the final event in a two-day summit seen as a big step forward in harnessing AI for good by starting to think about the serious risks it may pose.\n\nStory continues\n\nMusk and Sunak agreed on the possible need for physical \"off-switches\" to prevent robots from running out of control in a dangerous way, making reference to \"The Terminator\" film franchise and other science-fiction films.\n\n\"All these movies with the same plot fundamentally all end with the person turning it off,\" Sunak said, adding that the importance of physical off switches had formed part of the discussions at the summit earlier in the day.\n\nMusk told Sunak he thought AI was \"the most disruptive force in history\", speculating the technology would be able to \"do everything\" and make employment as we know it today a thing of the past.\n\n\"I don't know if that makes people comfortable or uncomfortable,\" he said.\n\n\"It's both good and bad.

Shepherd posted on social media on Wednesday, commenting after Toyota agreed to boost wages for U.S. workers by 9%, and to cut in half the time it takes new hires to reach the top pay rate.\n\nOther foreign automakers are reviewing recent auto-sector wage hikes. Honda told Reuters it is evaluating the recent UAW deals with the Detroit Three automakers and will remain competitive.\n\nToyota said working together with its plant workers has provided a \"history of stable employment and income for our employees.\"\n\n\u201cThe decision to unionize is ultimately made by our employees,\" the automaker said in a statement.\n\nUAW President Shawn Fain is expected to deliver a video address at 7 p.m. EDT (2300 GMT) on Thursday to outline details of the union's new contract with Stellantis.\n\nFain has used recent video addresses to telegraph the union's determination to organize workers at Toyota, Tesla and other nonunion U.S. automakers, using the record wage increases won in tentative agreements with Stellantis, General Motors and Ford.\n\n\"One of our biggest goals coming out of this historic contract victory is to organize like we\u2019ve never organized before,\" Fain said on Sunday. \"When we return to the bargaining table in 2028, it won\u2019t just be with the Big Three, but with the Big Five or Big Six.\"\n\nUAW Region 8 director Tim Smith, whose territory covers many nonunion auto factories in the southern United States, said workers at those plants have been reaching out to the UAW.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"You cannot believe the calls coming in,\" Smith told Reuters.\n\nUAW staff are keeping track of the calls, many from Toyota's sprawling assembly operation in Georgetown, Kentucky. The Toyota complex is not far from one of the UAW's largest local unions, which represents Ford's Kentucky Truck and Louisville Assembly plants.\n\nSmith said it was important workers consider the total wages and benefits and not just the wage rate. \"We got them a raise,\" he said. \"If (Toyota workers) come calling, which they have, we're going to educate them and be there for them.\"\n\nThe UAW has tried and failed for years to organize nonunion U.S. auto factories, most of them built by Asian and European legacy automakers in southern U.S. states where so-called right to work labor laws make it optional for workers to pay union dues.\n\nRecently, the union tried and failed to win enough support from workers at Tesla's Fremont, California, factory to hold an organizing vote. Tesla's Fremont plant was once a UAW shop when it was jointly owned by GM and Toyota and known as NUMMI.\n\n\"Nothing stopping Tesla team at our car plant from voting union. Could do so tmrw if they wanted. But why pay union dues & give up stock options for nothing?\" Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk tweeted in 2018.\n\nThe UAW filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board over that tweet, and the NLRB ruled the tweet violated labor laws prohibiting management threats against workers for supporting unionization. Earlier this year, a U.S. appeals court upheld the NLRB ruling.\n\nWIDENING COST GAPS\n\nThe UAW's organizing efforts from 2015 through 2020 were hindered by a federal investigation of corruption in the UAW's top ranks.\n\nFain earlier this year won the UAW presidency by vowing wide-ranging reform.\n\nToyota's move earlier this week to raise wages is in line with the strategy the Japanese automaker and other nonunion automakers have used to keep UAW organizers at bay.\n\nNonunion automakers have kept hourly wages close to the UAW rates at the Detroit Three. But they have lower labor costs overall because they pay less for health and retirement benefits than the unionized automakers. They also use more temporary workers, who are paid less.\n\nThe result is that average hourly labor costs in total at foreign automakers are $55 an hour, compared with $64 an hour under the old UAW contract, Ford sources estimated ahead of the new contract agreements. U.S. labor costs at Tesla are estimated at $45 to $50.\n\nThe gaps will get wider, assuming UAW workers at the Detroit Three ratify agreements that call for increasing pay for veteran workers by 25%, restoring cost-of-living allowances and boosting pay for temporary workers by as much as 150%.\n\n(Reporting by Joseph White in Detroit and David Shepardson in Washington Additional reporting by Ben Klayman in Detroit Editing by Matthew Lewis)", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-uaw-gears-organize-toyota-213210391.html", "symbols": ["TL0.F", "TL0.XETRA", "TM.US", "TMCO34.SA", "TMN.MX", "TOM.F", "TOMA.F", "TOYOF.US", "TSLA.MX", "TSLA.US", "TSLA34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.977, "neg": 0.04, "neu": 0.882, "pos": 0.078}}, {"date": "2023-11-02T20:49:00+00:00", "title": "Tesla Stock Soars on Analyst\u2019s $4 Trillion Prediction.

One such revolutionary product is being developed by Worksport Ltd (NASDAQ: WKSP)(NASDAQ: WKSPW). Today, Worksport announced it is gearing up for the alpha release of its highly anticipated COR portable battery system.\n\nWorksport Prepares For Initial Alpha Release Of Its Pioneering Portable Energy Storage System\n\nWorksport expects the initial release of COR to serve as a preliminary user iteration prior to the anticipated market release in North America, while it intends to bring this pioneering product across the globe. The horizon for Worksport seems promising as it approaches the alpha release of the COR portable battery storage which will complement its SOLIS solar-powered tonneau cover.

On Tuesday, it added it will be spending $8 billion to greatly expand the North Carolina battery plant that is set to open in 2025. But with a weakened EV demand in the U.S. due to inflation and other concerns, Toyota gets to benefit from stronger demand for hybrids it stayed loyal to.Its conventional hybrids rose 41% YoY to about 888,000 while sales of its plug-in hybrids were rose almost 90% YoY to roughly 39,000.\u00a0The so-called \u201celectrified\u201d vehicles that include both types of hybrids which are battery-electric models and fuel cell-powered vehicles\u00a0rose 27.3% YoY and made 36.4% of the automaker\u2019s total global sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nToyota Raised Its Fiscal Year Outlook\n\nFor the fiscal year that will end on March 31st, Toyota lifted its annual profit guidance from 3 trillion yen to 4.5 trillion yen which equates to\u00a0$29.8 billion.\n\nAlthough Ford Motor (NYSE: F), General Motors (NYSE: GM) and Stellantis (NYSE: STLA) ended the six-week UAW strike, the union is the winner, along with Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) as Detroit automakers lost big time. Besides having to tone down their EV ambitions in light of increased costs, the strike itself harmed General Motors, Stellantis and Ford immensely. Ford stated the UAW strike took off $1.3 billion from its earnings before interest and taxes. Walkouts costed GM $800 million. Stellantis only reported that the strikes dented revenue by\u00a0$3.2 billion.\u00a0Both Ford and GM announced they will be delaying their EV production and EV investments while Stellantis did not reveal any changes to its EV plans.

The earnings reports for several electric vehicle makers have been disappointing. Plus, they have cut down on their budgets to make EVs but this could be a temporary change.\n\nDue to higher interest rates and inflation, consumer spending was low and people are thinking twice about buying an EV. But keeping the government\u2019s long-term goals in mind, one cannot overlook the fact that EVs will be mainstream a few years down the line.\n\nSeveral EV makers have reported strong deliveries for October and while the EV hype might be slowing, it is not dying. This means there will be a steady demand for EV charging facilities and several early-stage companies have recognised this at the right time.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIf you do not want to invest in an EV stock, consider investing in these three best EV charging stocks for high returns.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) Gigafactory Texas\n\nSource: University of College / Shutterstock.com\n\nCall it an EV stock or an EV charging stock, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is the one to own. An industry leader with impressive financials, Tesla has recently opened its charging network for other automakers and it could be a game changer in the long term.\n\nWhile we may not see the charging network contributing much to the revenue right now, it could make a solid difference in the long term. Tesla has recently agreed to sell its chargers to\u00a0British Petroleum (NYSE: BP).\n\nAs per the agreement, BP\u2019s EV charging segment, BP Pulse will buy ultra-fast charging hardware units for $100 million. It is also the first time that a company will be using Tesla\u2019s hardware for the charging network. With more companies joining Tesla\u2019s charging networks, it will be able to generate revenue from an item that once used to be an expense.\n\nThat said, TSLA stock has been down since the company announced results and this makes it a solid chance to buy. Trading at $205, the stock is up 90% year-to-date and has lost about 18% of its value in the past month. It is trading much lower than the 52-week high of $299 which means there is plenty of upside potential.\n\nStory continues\n\nTesla has a massive charging network across the U.S. with 50,000+ superchargers and if it expands to other countries, it could see a significant revenue flow from this segment. Ford (NYSE:F) is planning to add another 15,000 Tesla chargers to its EV charging network, up from the previous projection of 12,000 chargers. With an improvement in demand for EVs, the demand for charging stations will be on the rise and this is when your investment in the stock will start to pay off.\n\nChargePoint (CHPT) EV stocks: A close-up shot of a ChargePoint charging station.\n\nSource: YuniqueB / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile the market is predicting that the demand for EVs will drop in the coming months, the demand for EV chargers will remain steady. This is because the EV charging infrastructure has become a big necessity today and its demand is already high.\n\nAs the number of cars on the road increases, EV charging companies will make big money. One of the top players in the EV charging space is ChargePoint (NYSE:CHPT).\n\nThe company\u2019s long-term potential looks bright and despite a slowdown in the EV space, ChargePoint is expected to continue growing. CHPT stock has dropped about 72% year-to-date and is trading close to $2.51 today. This drop makes it a strong buy. You will enjoy an early mover advantage with the investment.\n\nIt recently launched a new set of tools for fleet management and is designed to help owners handle their fleets. It includes features like charging station management and mobility services. While it may not have an immediate impact on the finances, it will help the company remain relevant in the coming years.\n\nIn the second quarter, it saw a 39% rise in revenue and hit $150 million and it expects to report revenue ranging between $150 million to $165 million in the third quarter. The company currently has more than 15,000 charging locations across the world and this is where it enjoys an edge over Tesla.\n\nSince Tesla\u2019s superchargers are only available in the U.S., ChargePoint has an opportunity to grab a wider market share globally. The company isn\u2019t profitable yet but it does enjoy a solid position in the industry and it can become a bigger player in the coming years.\n\nAllego (ALLG) A close-up shot of an electric vehicle plugged into an Allego (ALLG) charger.\n\nSource: szmuli / Shutterstock.com\n\nThird on my list of the best EV charging stocks is Allego (NYSE:ALLG). The company is a charging solutions provider and has recently reported impressive financials. While the stock is trading as low as $1.46, it was as high as $18 in 2022.\n\nIt has dropped 52% YTD, but it certainly has the potential for a bright future. Allego already has a wide network of 35,000 charging points in 16 countries which means it is in a good place to benefit from the rising EV demand across the globe.\n\nIn the recent quarter, it reported a healthy revenue growth of 34.6% and the revenue hit $166.39 million in 2022. One solid reason to bet on the stock is its backlog of 10,800 charging ports and once they are ready and operational, we could see higher revenue growth.\n\nAllego is an early-stage company that is making big moves. While the investment isn\u2019t without risks, the stock is available for cheap and it can certainly double your money.\n\nThe strong rollout of the charging networks has also led to a high operational margin and if it can sustain it, there will be an improvement in its financial position. ALLG stock may not be available at a discount for long so grab it while you can.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The electric-vehicle maker has trounced Tesla in China and is close to overtaking it in EV sales globally, as well. Munger led Berkshire\u2019s decision to invest in BYD.\n\n\u201cI have never helped do anything at Berkshire that was as good as BYD,\u201d Munger said in February at the annual meeting of news publisher Daily Journal. \u201cBYD is so much ahead of Tesla in China. It\u2019s almost ridiculous.\u201d\n\nMunger said that Berkshire\u2019s initial $270 million investment in BYD, made in 2008, was \u201cworth about $8 billion or maybe [$9 billion]. That\u2019s a pretty good rate of return.\u201d\n\nA big reason for BYD\u2019s success, Munger believes, is the caliber of its founder and CEO Wang Chuanfu, whom he described as a \u201ccombination of Thomas Edison and Jack Welch\u201d in 2009. Recently, he elaborated further on the qualities of the billionaire BYD founder, who grew up in extreme poverty, having been born to rice-farmer parents then orphaned as a child.\n\n\"He can do things you can't do,\" Munger said on a Sunday episode of the podcast Acquired. \"He's a fanatic that knows how to actually make things with his hands. He's closer to ground zero in other words. The guy at BYD is better at actually making things than Elon is.\"\n\nDescribing the investment in the Chinese automaker as a \u201cventure-capital-type play,\u201d he added, \u201cBYD was a miracle, but that guy worked 70 hours a week and has a very high IQ.\u201d Wang is also known to be a relentless cost-cutter, and he still lives a relatively frugal lifestyle.

BYD, a Chinese electric-car maker partially owned by Warren Buffetts Berkshire Hathaway Inc., dropped after forecasting a decline in profit. Photographer: Brent Lewin/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nYes to BYD, no to Tesla\n\nMunger was also pitched by Musk about Berkshire investing in Tesla, but Munger decided against it. In a dig at Munger, Musk tweeted earlier this year, \u201cMunger could\u2019ve invested in Tesla at ~$200M valuation when I had lunch with him in late 2008.\u201d The implication was that Munger could have made even more money on Tesla, whose market cap is now at $679 billion, than with BYD.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut Berkshire, with some exceptions, has avoided investing in automakers, deeming it too risky. As Buffett explained earlier this year: \u201cCharlie and I for long have felt that the auto industry is just too tough. It\u2019s just a business where you\u2019ve got a lot of worldwide competitors, they\u2019re not going to go away. And it looks like there are winners at any given time, but it doesn\u2019t get you a permanent place.\"\n\nHe continued, \u201cI think I know where Apple\u2019s going to be in five or 10 years, [but] I don\u2019t know what the car companies are going to be in five or 10 years.\u201d\n\nIn the Acquired podcast, Munger said, \"Who's going to win, who knows? The whole thing's been thrown way up in the air by all these electric cars, all these big new capital requirements, different ways of selling cars, and plus they've got these tough unions, so I just don't even look at the auto industry.\"\n\nEven BYD makes him nervous today, despite its success. Berkshire has been selling BYD shares since August of last year, including $25.7 million worth last month.\n\n\"I may be a big fan, but I'm sort of hanging on by my hat while they lurch around the track,\" he said. \"They make me nervous, it's so aggressive.\u201d He described \u201chuge mistakes\u201d BYD made in its early days, when it \u201calmost went broke with [its] early dealership building system.\u201d\n\nBut when asked what captivated him about BYD, Munger replied: \u201cThe guy was a genius. He had a Ph.D. in engineering and he could look at somebody\u2019s part in the morning\u2026and in the afternoon he could make it. I\u2019ve never seen anybody like that. He can do anything. He is a natural engineer and a get-it-done-type production executive, and that\u2019s a big talent to have in one place.\u201d\n\nIt helps explain why BYD, which makes its own batteries and semiconductor chips, came just 3,456 vehicles shy of overtaking Tesla in global EV sales in the third quarter and is poised to overtake it. BYD sold 431,603 fully electric vehicles in the quarter, up 23% from the previous quarter.\n\n\u201cBYD will sell more fully electric passenger vehicles than Tesla in the fourth quarter,\u201d Taylor Ogan, CEO of Shenzhen-based hedge fund Snow Bull Capital, which owns shares in both automakers, told Bloomberg last month.\n\nWhile it\u2019s known for selling affordable vehicles to the masses, BYD recently introduced luxury brands to its lineup, helping fuel its sales surge. It\u2019s also selling more cars abroad\u2014particularly in Europe and Southeast Asia\u2014with exports accounting for 9% of third-quarter sales, up from 5% in the previous quarter.\n\nIn May, Musk responded to a resurfaced 2011 interview showing him laughing at the quality of BYD cars.\n\n\u201cThat was many years ago,\u201d Musk explained. \u201cTheir cars are highly competitive these days.\u201d\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/charlie-munger-says-elon-musk-180622253.html", "symbols": ["002594.SHE", "1211.HK", "BERK34.SA", "BRH.F", "BRK-A.US", "BRK-B.US", "BRKB.MX", "BRYN.F", "BRYN.XETRA", "BY6.F", "BY6A.F", "BYDDF.US", "BYDDY.US", "TL0.F", "TL0.XETRA", "TSLA.MX", "TSLA.US", "TSLA34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.993, "neg": 0.032, "neu": 0.885, "pos": 0.082}}, {"date": "2023-11-02T18:01:15+00:00", "title": "Expert Claims Resolution of UAW Strike Will Strengthen \u2018Growth of Electric Vehicles\u2019 \u2014 Here\u2019s Why", "content": "DeeCee Carter / MediaPunch / Shutterstock.com\n\nFollowing a six-week strike, United Auto Workers (UAW) reached what it calls a\u00a0\u201chistoric tentative agreement with General Motors that paves the way for a just transition and wins record economic gains for autoworkers.\u201d And now, some experts argue that the resolution could also strengthen the growth of electric vehicles. (EVs).\n\nMore Bang for Your Buck: Cars That Last Twice as Long as Average Vehicles\r\nBe Aware: 6 Used Cars To Stay Away From\n\n\u201cLike the agreements with Ford and Stellantis, the GM agreement has turned record profits into a record contract. The deal includes gains valued at more than four times the gains from the union\u2019s 2019 contract. It provides more in base wage increases than GM workers have received in the past 22 years,\u201d the UAW said in a statement.\n\nThe agreement includes 25% in base wage increases through April 2028, and will cumulatively raise the top wage by 33% compounded with estimated cost-of-living adjustments (COLA) to over $42 an hour, according to the statement. The starting wage will increase by 70% compounded with estimated COLA to over $30 an hour.\n\nIn a comment to Newsweek, Cornell University professor and labor expert Harry Katz said of the deals, \u201cI think it\u2019s helped, rather than hindered, the growth of electric vehicles.\u201d\n\nWhy Does It Matter for EV Growth?\n\nAs Newsweek reported, EVs have been at the center of negotiations during the strike against Ford, GM and Stellantis, the company that makes the Jeep, Ram and Chrysler brands.\n\nMore: Avoid 5 Electric Vehicles That Will Likely Break Down After 50,000 Miles\n\nDuring negotiations, industry executives argued they couldn\u2019t produce EVs at scale and remain competitive while paying higher wages, according to Newsweek. But the dilemma proved to be false when automakers granted the deals, Jason Walsh, executive director of the BlueGreen Alliance (a coalition of environmental groups and labor organizations, including the UAW), told Newsweek.\n\nMore Costs for EV Makers\n\nYet, according to Peter C. Earle, economist, American Institute for Economic Research, there are tradeoffs associated with entering wage agreements.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cYes, the automakers are gaining some increased certainty in their cost structure, but only over the term of the UAW agreement,\u201d said Earle. \u201cAnd if other aspects of production costs change \u2014 for example, higher costs of inputs, such as raw materials \u2014 the inflexibility (\u201cstickiness\u201d) of labor costs present a burden to overcome \u2014 and quite possibly a factor forcing final prices higher.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, by agreeing to unionize the workforce at the new EV and battery facilities, another layer of expense has been added to the price of the final product.\n\n\u201cFor just like tariffs, regulatory fees, and other such costs, the increased expense of collective bargaining agreements will be borne by the end customer, not by the auto companies,\u201d he said.\n\nEV Makers Have Bigger Issues Than Resolution of Strike and Associated Costs\n\nFor Ford, GM, and Stellantis, according to Peter Glenn, founder and co-CEO of EV Life, resolving the strike has a relatively low cost, and more importantly, enables these automakers to get back to addressing two much bigger EV issues: the EV green premium and the lack of reliable public charging.\n\n\u201cOne of the developments we\u2019re excited to watch for 2024 is how Ford and GM electric vehicles gaining access to Tesla\u2019s NACS SuperCharger network will improve its sales,\u201d said Glenn.\n\nGlenn added that Tesla\u2019s public charging network is the only reliable charging network in America, so when Ford, GM and other non-Tesla vehicles get access to them in 2024, their EV sales will scale rapidly with consumer confidence in knowing that they can use Tesla\u2019s world class charging network in their Ford or GM vehicles.\n\n\u201cBy resolving the labor dispute and scaling manufacturing, Ford and GM can take full advantage of maximizing their EV sales as they gain access to NACS,\u201d he added.\n\nAs for the green premium on EVs, Glenn said that it \u201cmay be a taller order.\u201d\n\nHe noted that according to KBB data, the average price of a non-luxury new car in the U.S. is $45,000.\u00a0And while the Ford Mach-E, Chevy Bolt and Equinox, and even Tesla\u2019s Model Y and Model 3 start from below $45,000, even these EVs still cost $10,000 to $20,000 more than equivalent commuter ICE vehicles like the Toyota RAV4 and Camry.\n\n\u201cWith interest rates unlikely to drop significantly until at least late 2024, automakers and consumers should be looking for new and innovative ways to finance EVs that are different from traditional auto loans,\u201d he added.\n\nMore From GOBankingRates\n\n10 Best Canadian Cities To Retire on a Budget of $2,500 a Month Which Bank Gives 6% Interest on Savings Accounts? 3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000 18 Ways Your Credit Card Can Be Your Best Financial Friend\n\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Expert Claims Resolution of UAW Strike Will Strengthen \u2018Growth of Electric Vehicles\u2019 \u2014 Here\u2019s Why", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/expert-claims-resolution-uaw-strike-180115102.html", "symbols": ["TL0.F", "TL0.XETRA", "TSLA.MX", "TSLA.US", "TSLA34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.998, "neg": 0.033, "neu": 0.827, "pos": 0.14}}, {"date": "2023-11-02T17:07:18+00:00", "title": "UAW gears up to organize Toyota, other nonunion automakers", "content": "By Joseph White and David Shepardson\n\nDETROIT/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Leaders of the United Auto Workers signaled the next step in their campaign to capitalize on the union's success in bargaining with the Detroit Three: launching organizing drives at Toyota, Tesla and other nonunion U.S. auto factories.\n\n\"What could @Toyota workers win if they joined the #StandUpUAW campaign?\" UAW organizing director Brian O.

But what the regulator wants to see is that operators implement a single view of the customers so it goes across all brands.\u201d\n\nShe said the impact of these measures was around \u00a3165m.\n\nShe said: \u201cIt\u2019s a short-term impact that is painful, of course, for the business.

Bank of England to hold rates steady has emboldened some analysts to say they think it is unlikely rates will rise again before there are cuts.\n\nEmma Mogford, fund manager at Premier Miton said:\n\nI feel increasingly confident we are now at peak rates.\n\nThe rapid increase in interest rates in the last year will continue to bring down demand for goods and services and hence inflation, which the Bank of England expects to be back at 2pc in two years.\n\nIf inflation can fall while the economy is resilient, that should be good for UK equities.\n\nYael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG

A year ago the figure stood at 16.4% year to date and was only 9.1% in 2021.\n\nWhen hybrid and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles are included with BEVs, the figure jumps up 35.4% for all vehicles sold year to date in California. Not surprisingly this means gas-powered sales are falling in the state, with the CNCDA reporting ICE market share (including gasoline and diesel vehicles) was 64.6% so far this year, down from 71.6% in 2022 and 88.4% in 2018.\n\nCalifornia is known as the vanguard for automotive trends in the country, with shifts in preferences and government policy eventually spreading to the rest of the country.

In fact the Tesla Model Y was the top-selling vehicle overall in California, followed by the Model 3 and the Toyota (TM) RAV4 (40,622) and Toyota Camry (39,293).\n\nWhile good news for Tesla, its overall market share has slipped from 71.8% YTD last year. BEVs from brands like Chevrolet, BMW, Mercedes, and Hyundai have been slowly eating into Tesla\u2019s market share.\n\nOverall in the state, Toyota is the sales king with 15% of overall sales, followed by Tesla at 13.5% share. Interestingly in Q2 Tesla narrowly edged out Toyota for top sales in the state, before sales swung back to Toyota in Q3.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat being said, Tesla\u2019s sales in the state climbed by 38.5% year to date, while Toyota\u2019s actually shrunk by 0.7%.

However, there are also concerns that demand will weaken in the near term as high interest rates begin to bite at consumer spending. In this context, investors should be wary of Lucid (NASDAQ:LCID), a luxury EV maker that faces several challenges in its quest to become profitable and competitive. Below are three reasons to be bearish on Lucid.\n\nDeliveries are declining\n\nLucid\u2019s deliveries have been on the decline in 2023. According to its Q1 2023 financial results, Lucid produced 2,314 Air sedans and delivered 1,406 vehicles in the first quarter, down from 3,493 and 2,780 respectively in Q4 2022. At the time, CEO Peter Rawlinson said he believed \u201ctoo few people are aware\u201d of the company, which surely doesn\u2019t bode well for Lucid\u2019s growth prospects. The second quarter delivery results were not too dissimilar. Lucid delivered 1,404 Air sedans in the second quarter. Lucid\u2019s second-quarter deliveries compared 679 in the second quarter of 2022.\n\nThe luxury EV automaker\u2019s third quarter delivery results continued to underwhelm investors, further solidifying fears that slumping EV demand is harming Lucid\u2019s potential to grow.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nRevenue growth and profitability margins are compressing\n\nLucid\u2019s revenue growth is significantly slowing down amid EV demand pressures. Lucid reported revenue of $149.4 million in Q1 2023, which is a 159% increase year-over-year but a 42% decrease quarter-over-quarter. The company also posted a net loss of $779 million, widening from $472 million in Q4 2022. Second quarter financial results were not any better. While revenue came in $151 million, increasing by 55% year-over-year, from a quarter-to-quarter perspective, revenue increased only by barely 1%.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs deliveries decline, the automaker\u2019s ability to become profitability becomes further out of reach, which will disappoint long term holders. Lastly, while Lucid\u2019s balance sheet remains robust with $5.2 billion in cash, if losses continue to expand, this cash balance could dwindle and force the company to raise equity or debt, which could dilute current investors or further compress bottom-line margins.\n\nValuation remains a problem\n\nLucid\u2019s valuation is concerning. Although the luxury EV maker is trading at 7.9x forward sale, the company is yet to be profitability and thus its profitability metrics make the stock a tough sale. Lucid expects to achieve positive EBITDA by 2024 and positive free cash flow by 2025, but these projections are contingent on reaching lofty delivery targets. Given the way production and deliveries have been lackluster in 2023, it\u2019s hard to believe the company will be approaching EBITDA or bottom-line profitability any time soon.\n\nIntense competition from other luxury EV makers, including Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) itself and a host of German automakers, including Mercedes-Benz (OTCMKTS:MBGYY) and BMW (OTCMKTS:BMWYY), has not helped Lucid\u2019s growth either. These companies not only are better known, but have the capital and resources to sell a large number of vehicles even in a difficult market. Lucid will need to bring a lot more to the table in order to displace these competitors.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The results weren\u2019t far off from what I would expect. There\u2019s a good representation of technology firms and a few firms that benefit from secular trends as well.\n\nAlphabet isn\u2019t on the list so Bard is either unbiased or being coy.\n\nTech stocks are suffering but we\u2019re also nearing peak interest rates. Tech shares will be very strong at the first sign of rate cuts so most analysts would agree with Bard there. Likewise, analysts agree that secular trends like the gig economy, financial literacy, and vehicle electrification are investment worthy.\u00a0So check out these AI stock picks to see if any are a good fit for your portfolio.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMeta Platforms (META) Meta Written On The Googles - Man Wearing Virtual Reality Goggles Inside A Metaverse. FTC investigating META.\n\nSource: Aleem Zahid Khan / Shutterstock.com\n\nI agree with Bard\u2019s assertion that Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is poised to grow in 2024. Its performance and the presumption of rate cuts during 2024 assure that growth will occur. A doubling of your investment is probably a stretch, though.\n\nFor that to happen, META shares would have to rise above $570. That\u2019s nearly $100 above the highest target price assigned to Meta by Wall Street analysts. Not impossible, just unlikely.\n\nThat said, Meta Platforms has done what it has needed to do recently. The company has increased revenues beyond levels that Wall Street was expecting. The $34.2 billion in sales was $900 billion higher than the consensus expectation on the Street. However, Meta telegraphed some weakness in advertising in Q4 which has Wall Street concerned and erased initial celebration.\n\nI believe Meta is back and it\u2019s one of Bard\u2019s AI stock picks. The firm\u2019s efficiency efforts are paying dividends, not literally, but in increased operational margins. Meta isn\u2019t letting off the gas on the metaverse, that\u2019s clear. It has prioritized there by slashing its workforce to gain efficiency while allowing for greater losses through Reality Labs.\n\nStory continues\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) on phone screen stock image.\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\nFor Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) to double in 2024, the stock will have to reach $410. That\u2019s just above the high target price among the analysts covering its shares currently. It\u2019s also near the high water mark of TSLA shares historically, reached just before quantitative tightening began.\u00a0Still there\u2019s a good reason it\u2019s one of my favorite AI stock picks.\n\nIt then makes sense that as quantitative easing resumes in 2024 that Tesla could pick back up where it left off in November of 2021. It isn\u2019t the same company now as it was then. Vehicle deliveries are up roughly 50% based on unit volumes.\n\nRevenues are essentially flat at the moment. They only increased by 5% in Q3 on a year-over-year basis. The company is doing what a lot of firms are currently: Attempting to reduce costs while maximizing sales.\n\nThat isn\u2019t different from what any company does at any point but it\u2019s also worth noting that Tesla needs to increase its market share as a priority. It\u2019s a difficult balancing act between growing in places like China while finding places to trim the fat at the same time.\n\nThe good news is that the United Auto Worker strikes have granted Tesla some breathing room momentarily by dinging the big three.\n\nLithium Americas (LAC) Person holding smartphone with logo of Canadian company Lithium Americas Corp (LAC) on screen in front of website Focus on phone display.\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nBard notes that Lithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) is well-positioned to benefit from increasing demand for lithium. It\u2019s an EV play and supplier of the soft metal used in the production of EV batteries.\n\nLithium Americas definitely has the potential to double in 2024. For one, it\u2019s cheap at less than $7. Analysts believe it could reach $20 in the near future.\n\nLAC shares have faced a lot of trouble since splitting into two publicly traded firms in early October. The split continues to make sense. LAC will derive its strength from the Thacker Pass mine which is among the largest globally. It\u2019s also confined within the U.S. which makes it geopolitically important.\n\nOn the other hand, it\u2019s an early stage project that won\u2019t produce lithium for several years. Further, lithium prices have tanked momentarily.\n\nReaders should recognize that Lithium America\u2019s best chance to double in 2024 is not production but instead, rising lithium prices. Those prices will determine its ability to prosper over the next 12 months. The longer term factors mean it could produce returns of many several hundred percent with patience.\n\nSolid Power (SLDP) Smartphone with logo of American battery company Solid Power Inc. on screen in front of business website. Focus on center-left of phone display.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nNext generation batteries like those from Solid Power (NASDAQ:SLDP) are on the radar of stock investors everywhere. Solid state technology promises to reduce powerful barriers to adoption for EVs by drastically reducing charging times and improving EV ranges.\n\nCurrent estimates suggest that the increased energy density of solid state batteries will lead to 600 mile ranges in some EVs. Current generation liquid electrolyte batteries are simply not as technologically capable. That\u2019s the promise of Solid Power: Commercializing solid state EV batteries.\n\nSolid Power absolutely can double in 2024. It\u2019s a penny stock trading for $1.40 at the moment. That said, it has powerful partners in BMW (OTCMKTS:BMWYY) and Ford (NYSE:F). Combined with target prices that offer more than 100% upside, a doubling of your investment is entirely within the realm of possibility.\n\nThe company is delivering sample cells to its partners for validation so it\u2019s already on its way to commercialization. Of course, there\u2019s a lot of work to be done before commercialization but SLDP is worth looking at.\n\nAlibaba (BABA) A photo of the Alibaba (BABA) app on a smartphone.\n\nSource: BigTunaOnline / Shutterstock.com\n\nBard also recommends Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) as a stock to buy for a shot at doubling your investment in 2024. Alibaba has had a difficult 2023 and shares have fallen as a result. It\u2019s the eCommerce leader in China.\n\nAlibaba acts as a proxy for the Chinese economy overall. That makes it a divisive stock as China\u2019s economy, like that of the U.S., is volatile and difficult to predict currently.\n\nAlibaba is also comparable to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) as both firms lead eCommerce and cloud in their respective markets. Both are investing heavily in AI as the risks of doing so are far less than not. My colleague, Muslim Farooque, pointed out that Alibaba is especially strong regarding cash flow.\n\nBasically, $29 billion dollars more flowed into Alibaba over the last year than out of it. That strong cash position affords Alibaba certain options that many, many firms simply don\u2019t have available to them.\n\nFiverr International (FVRR) The Fiverr website displayed on a mobile phone screen.\n\nSource: Temitiman / Shutterstock.com\n\nFiverr International (NYSE:FVRR) continues to head in the right direction on strong secular trends that buoy its stock. Bard notes that the surging growth of freelancing and remote work is a strong catalyst favoring FVRR shares.\n\nThat said, Fiverr International\u2019s strength isn\u2019t its top-line growth. In fact, the company\u2019s top line isn\u2019t growing much at all at the moment. The firm\u2019s real strength right now is its ability to enact a turnaround led by its operations.\n\nOperating expenses fell to $4.01 million in Q2 \u201823 from $42.65 million a year prior. That allowed the firm to eke out a $227,000 net income. A year earlier that figure was -$41.86 million.\n\nThus, it isn\u2019t difficult to see why Bard would recommend that investors consider Fiverr International for a chance at doubling their investment in 2024. The company has also invested in AI in order to better match its talent pool to opportunities while also updating full year guidance.\n\nNerd Wallet (NRDS) graphic showing characters on a set of oversized charts and pie graphs\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAmong the more interesting AI stock picks is Nerd Wallet (NASDAQ:NRDS). It appeals to investors for a simple reason: Consumer demand for financial information services is increasing. Not a day goes by in which I don\u2019t hear the phrase financial literacy.\n\nDon\u2019t misunderstand, I\u2019m not tired of the notion at all. In fact, I welcome it. Nerd Wallet serves consumers and small and medium businesses primarily. The stock has the potential to double in 2024 based on Wall Street\u2019s expectations.\n\nThe company offers credit cards and loans to its readership. That\u2019s how it keeps the lights on. It\u2019s not simply in it to give consumers financial education. It sold 7% more of its products in Q3 on a year-over-year basis. However, Nerd Wallet is hovering around profitability.\n\nIt made less than a million a year ago but lost less than a million this year in Q3. I\u2019m inclined to agree with Bard here because the company makes a lot of sales overall. It\u2019s ready to turn the corner toward sustained profitability so I believe it can run much higher.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

They\u2019re the worst of times. Shares are down 81% this year because, while revenue is increasing, the company isn\u2019t making any money.\n\nFor the three months ending in July, ChargePoint lost $125 million and only brought in brought in, which was $150 million. It burned through $190 million in cash and ended the quarter with $233 million of it. It\u2019s having to raise more, watering down existing stockholders. This company should have worked. Investors need to ask why it didn\u2019t.\n\nChargePoint Sells a Product\n\nChargePoint saw itself as a product company. It makes chargers, which convert AC power into the DC power used by a car, most support 240 volts of power or less. That\u2019s the draw of your home washing machine.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nChargePoint had a \u201cstandard\u201d it called DC Fast for 480 volt chargers. It lost that race to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), whose plugs are now the industry standard. ChargePoint had to write off $28 million of inventory just in the second quarter.\n\nInstead of building a public charging network, ChargePoint focused on selling directly to fleet customers. It claims to have delivered 188,000 chargers and serve 75% of the Fortune 50. But ChargePoint \u201csubscription revenue\u201d was just $30 million in the second quarter. Once a charger is sold, it\u2019s forgotten.\n\nChargePoint will argue that a \u201cservice\u201d business model wouldn\u2019t work either. Rival EVgo (NASDAQ:EVGO), which manages as well as installs chargers, also lost money in its most recent quarter. CHPT stock is down 71% this year.\n\nFill \u2018Er Up\n\nThe problem is simple. ChargePoint has yet to master the fill-up experience.\n\nFilling a car with gas takes 5 minutes, anyone can do it and you don\u2019t even have to go inside a store. Filling a car with electricity takes much, much longer, about a half-hour. For most EVs, that delivers 200 miles of range, or three hours of driving. How would you like to stop a half-hour for every three hours of driving on your next road trip? And what would you do in the meantime?\n\nStory continues\n\nA year ago, General Motors (NYSE:GM) and EVgo tried to answer that question through a deal with Pilot Flying J, the truck stop chain controlled by Berkshire-Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B). That\u2019s now being rolled out, with your tax dollars working on it.\n\nBut you can\u2019t just install a charger at a gas station and walk away. It has to be serviced. Customers need something to do with their time.\n\nBuc-ees, the fast-growing Texas chain of super-sized gas stations, is now supporting Tesla chargers at some locations. You still have the problem of monitoring that charge. How do you know when your car is full? Unless someone is there, chargers can be filled with fully charged cars and new customers can\u2019t get in.\n\nThe Bottom Line on CHPT Stock\n\nChargePoint sees EV charging as a product.It\u2019s a service. That\u2019s why I\u2019m not buying the stock, even at current levels.\n\nThe service isn\u2019t delivering electricity. It\u2019s delivering the experience of getting a fill-up and getting on your way.\n\nEVs work great in town. Utility companies, which make their money off the electricity, sell ChargePoint Level 2 chargers for about $550. But if I\u2019m going to commit half a year\u2019s income to a car I\u2019m going to want to go anywhere, and know I won\u2019t have a refueling problem.\n\nWhat the EV needs are true electric service stations to provide that experience. ChargePoint doesn\u2019t do that. That\u2019s why ChargePoint, its rivals, and the whole industry is in trouble right now.\n\nAs of this writing, Dana Blankenhorn did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the\u00a0InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nDana Blankenhorn has been a financial and technology journalist since 1978.

BYD shares\u00a0are up 1.7% this month, outperforming Tesla whose stock took a 17% dive and declines in other peers as well.\u00a0By reporting a growth slowdown, a warning was sent to all EV makers but BYD defied its trend with its latest quarter, showing it preserved its domestic market leadership despite softer demand and intensified competition in China.\n\nBYD\u2019s Quarterly Highlights\n\nDuring the third quarter, BYD reported its revenue rose 38.5% YoY to\u00a0162.2 billion yuan\u00a0with net profit rising 82.2%\u00a0YoY to 10.41 billion yuan ($1.42 billion), yet this was a smaller increase compared to previous, second quarter when profit rose 145%.\n\nMeanwhile, Li Auto, XPeng and Nio recorded delivery records in October.\n\nLi Auto (NASDAQ: LI) openly showed its intention to become the top-selling luxury brand in China. During the earnings call, Li Auto executives expressed their confidence of this EV startup challenging the automotive giants in China, including Mercedes-Benz Group AG (OTC: MBGYY)(OTC: MBGAF), BMW (OTC: BMWYY), and Audi, subsidiary of the Volkswagen Group\u00a0(OTC: VWAGY). In August, Li Auto reported its sales rose 664% YoY to\u00a034,914. In September, deliveries rose 213% YoY to 36,060.\u00a0During the third quarter, Li Auto deliveries grew 296.3% to 105,108 vehicles. Moreover, during October, Li Auto delivered\u00a040,422 vehicles, the first time its monthly deliveries surpassed 40,000 units and marking its seventh consecutive record high as monthly deliveries grew\u00a0302.1%\u00a0YoY.\n\nVolkswagen-backed XPeng Inc (NYSE: XPEV) deliveries reached another record in October after already delivering a record 15,310 EVs in September, translating to a 12% month-over-month rise and 81% YoY growth. In October, Xpeng stated it delivered 20,002 units, which translates to\u00a031% increase from the month and a 292% YoY growth.Xpeng delivered 40,008 smart EVs during the third quarter which translates to a quarter-over-quarter increase of 72%.\u00a0Last month, XPeng CEO met with Volkswagen executives in Germany, showing the deepening of this strategic EV partnership. Supported by Volkswagen, Europe\u2019s biggest automaker, XPeng has what it takes to expand its footprint as it plans to conquer German, Britain and France next year.\n\nStory continues\n\nNio Inc (NYSE: NIO) also reported its deliveries improved in October, but not as much as of its peers. In October, Nio delivered\u00a016,074 vehicles, translating to a 59.8% YoY growth and 2.77% improvement from September. Nio continues to be constrained by its sales capacity as back in June, it acknowledged it is lagging its EV peers on this front but it is still growing fast and getting ready to conquer Europe, just like XPeng. Nio is building a dealer network for its sub brand Firefly whose European deliveries are scheduled for late next year.\n\nBy the looks of it, BYD is rapidly closing in on Tesla who missed on earnings and revenue for the first time since 2019 while BYD posted all-time high sales despite intensifying competition from LiAuto, Xpeng and Nio, as well as a broader slowdown in China\u2019s new EV sales.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

Several leading tech companies that normally hit home runs with their financial results missed the mark, sending their stock prices lower as a result. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) are two major tech concerns that disappointed with their Q3 prints. At the same time, there have been several smaller and less influential tech concerns that have seen their share prices rise sharply after surprising investors with their Q3 earnings. Social media companies, fintech concerns and chipmakers that endured punishing downturns in their stock over the past year have now reversed higher following solid Q3 results and impressive forward guidance. These stocks present a great opportunity for investors to ride a post-earnings bump higher. Here are three breakout stocks to consider.\n\nPinterest (PINS) Pinterest, Inc. (PINS) logo\n\nSource: tanuha2001 / Shutterstock.com\n\nLook at Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) go. Shares of the social media company are up 19% after it reported third-quarter financial results that beat Wall Street forecasts across the board. Pinterest announced earnings per share (EPS) of 28 cents compared to 20 cents expected on Wall Street. Revenue for the three months ended Sept. 30 rose 11% from a year earlier to $763.2 million, which was better than the $743.5 million that was expected.\n\nPinterest said that the number of global monthly active users on its platform rose 8% during Q3 from a year earlier to 482 million. Analysts had penciled in 473 million monthly users. Additionally, the average revenue per user was $1.61, which beat analyst projections of $1.59. In terms of forward guidance, Pinterest said it expects revenue growth of 11% to 13% in the current fourth quarter of the year, which is better than the 11.3% growth anticipated by analysts who track the company\u2019s progress. Pinterest added that its Q4 operating expenses will likely decline by 9% to 13% year-over-year.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe post-Q3 earnings bounce brings PINS stock to a year-to-date gain of 30%.\n\nSoFi Technologies (SOFI) SoFi Technologies, Inc logo with stock market chart background. is an American online personal finance company and online bank.\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nShares of SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ:SOFI) are also breaking out after the financial technology company delivered a solid earnings beat and raised its forward guidance. Due to exceptional growth in its student loan segment, SoFi reported a Q3 loss of 3 cents per share, much less than the loss of 6 cents forecasted on Wall Street. The company\u2019s Q3 adjusted net revenue totaled $530.7 million, ahead of the $511.3 million expected. Student loan originations for Q3 amounted to $919.3 million \u2014 41% higher than a forecast of $651.5 million.\n\nSoFi also reported personal and home loans of $3.89 billion and $355.7 million, respectively, each of which topped analyst estimates. Looking ahead, SoFi Technologies raised its forward guidance for all of this year, saying it now expects revenue of $2.05 billion, up from $1.97 billion previously. Analysts and investors cheered the Q3 print, which was the best the company has produced since the Covid-19 pandemic. SOFI stock rose 9% after the Q3 results were made public, and the company\u2019s share price is now up 68% on the year.\n\nIntel (INTC) Close up of Intel (INTC) sign at entrance of The Intel Museum in Silicon Valley. Intel is an American multinational corporation and technology company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nShares of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) popped 7% higher after the microchip and semiconductor company issued third-quarter financial results that had analysts on Wall Street cheering. Intel announced EPS of 41 cents versus 22 cents that had been forecast. Revenue came in at $14.16 billion versus $13.53 billion that was expected. The company\u2019s gross margin for the quarter was flat at 45.8%, and revenue for the quarter was 8% lower than a year earlier. However, Intel executives said they foresee positive revenue growth in the current fourth quarter and reiterated plans to cut costs by $3 billion this year.\n\nThe commitment to cost controls seems to be what really led investors to bid up INTC stock. The company made a point to emphasize that its operating expenses declined 15% in Q3 from a year ago. Also, management at Intel singled out the company\u2019s progress in pivoting to become a foundry business that doesn\u2019t just design microchips and semiconductors but fabricates them as well. While chip manufacturing is still a small part of Intel\u2019s business, with only $311 million of sales in Q3, the unit\u2019s revenue grew nearly 300% from a year earlier.\n\nWith the Q3 pop, INTC stock is now up 37% in 2023 and continuing to rise.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole\u00a0held a long position in GOOGL.

Higher bond yields and rising geopolitical tensions have been weighing on investor sentiments.\r\n\r\nThis has resulted in huge demand for inverse or inverse-leveraged ETFs as these fetch outsized returns on bearish sentiments in a short span. We have highlighted the five best-leveraged inverse ETFs that piled up handsome gains of more than 25% last month amid the market turmoil. These include MAX Auto Industry -3x Inverse Leveraged ETN CARD, GraniteShares 1.5x Short TSLA Daily ETF TSDD, Direxion Daily S&P Biotech Bear 3x Shares LABD, Daily S&P 500 High Beta Bear 3X Shares HIBS, and MicroSectors Travel -3x Inverse Leveraged ETN FLYD.\r\n\r\nThe 10-year Treasury yield hit 5% \u2014 its highest level since 2007 \u2014 causing worries regarding the potential impact of higher debt costs on business development and overall economic growth. Investors are betting that the Fed would keep interest rates at their current high levels for longer amid concerns over inflation spiking again due to the high energy prices.\r\n\r\nThe raft of economic data showing the resilience of economic growth is also bolstering the case for persistently high rate expectations. Notably, the world's biggest economy emerged stronger than expected in the third quarter, defying all the challenges. The economy expanded at the fastest pace in nearly two years, with GDP rising 4.9% annually, more than twice the 2.1% growth in the second quarter. However, the breakneck pace of growth is expected to ease as higher long-term borrowing rates coupled with the Fed\u2019s short-term rate hikes will cool down spending by businesses and consumers (read: 5 ETFs to Bet on Highest GDP Growth in Nearly 2 Years).\r\n\r\nFurther, the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict has resulted in global uncertainties, leading to risk-off trade.\n\nStory continues\n\nInverse ETFs\n\nThese products either create a short position or a leveraged short position in the underlying index through swaps, options, futures contracts and other financial instruments. Due to their compounding effect, investors can enjoy higher returns in a short period of time, provided the trend remains a friend.\r\n\r\nHowever, these funds run the risk of huge losses compared to traditional ones in fluctuating or seesawing markets. Further, their performance could vary significantly from the actual performance of the underlying index over a longer period compared to a shorter period (such as weeks or months).\r\n\r\nMAX Auto Industry -3x Inverse Leveraged ETN (CARD) \u2013 Up 77.9%\r\n\r\nMAX Auto Industry -3x Inverse Leveraged ETN seeks to offer three times inverse exposure to the daily performance of the Prime Auto Industry Index. It charges 95 bps in annual fees and has accumulated $5.5 million in its asset base. MAX Auto Industry -3x Inverse Leveraged ETN trades in an average daily volume of about 1,000 shares (read: Best Inverse/Leveraged ETFs of Last Week).\r\n\r\nGraniteShares 1.5x Short TSLA Daily ETF (TSDD) \u2013 Up 34.4%\r\n\r\nGraniteShares 1.5x Short TSLA Daily ETF offers 1.5 times (170%) inverse exposure to the daily percentage change of the common stock of Tesla (TSLA), charging 1.50% in annual fees. It has amassed $0.8 million in its asset base since its debut in late August. GraniteShares 1.5x Short TSLA Daily ETF trades in an average daily volume of 14,000 shares.\r\n\r\nDirexion Daily S&P Biotech Bear 3x Shares (LABD) \u2013 Up 29.9%\r\n\r\nDirexion Daily S&P Biotech Bear 3x Shares seeks to deliver three times the inverse daily performance of the S&P Biotechnology Select Industry Index, which includes domestic companies from the biotechnology industry. Direxion Daily S&P Biotech Bear 3x Shares has amassed $68.5 million in its asset base and has an average daily volume of around 4 million shares. It charges investors 95 bps in annual fees.\r\n\r\nDaily S&P 500 High Beta Bear 3X Shares (HIBS) \u2013 Up 29.5%\r\n\r\nDaily S&P 500 High Beta Bear 3X Shares offers three times inverse exposure to the performance of the S&P 500 High Beta Index.

Daily S&P 500 High Beta Bear 3X Shares charges 95 bps in fees per year from investors.\r\n\r\nMicroSectors Travel -3x Inverse Leveraged ETN (FLYD) \u2013 Up 26.6%\r\n\r\nMicroSectors Travel -3x Inverse Leveraged ETN offers three times inverse exposure to the performance of the MerQube MicroSectors U.S. Travel Index, which measures the performance of large, liquid U.S. listed and domiciled companies operating in the RBICS Sub Industries related to travel and tourism. It has gathered $6.2 million in its asset base.\r\n\r\nMicroSectors Travel -3x Inverse Leveraged ETN charges 95 bps in fees per year and trades in an average daily volume of 31,000 shares.\n\nBottom Line\n\nWhile the strategy is highly beneficial for short-term traders, it could lead to huge losses compared with traditional funds in fluctuating markets (see: all the Inverse Equity ETFs here).\r\n\r\nStill, for ETF investors who are bearish on equities for the near term, either of the above products could make an interesting choice. These could be attractive for those with high-risk tolerance and who believe that the \u201ctrend is the friend\u201d in this specific corner of the investing world.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you have an extra six figures lying around, now might be the time to buy these 7 luxury cars.\n\nBMW 7 Series\n\nPrice: approximately $88,000\n\nAccording to Peter Jones, founder of Motor & Wheels, the \u201cBMW 7 Series is one of the top luxury sedans out there. The 2023 models start at around $88,000 but have incredible performance and handling. Their resale value holds strong, so it could pay off as a long-term investment.\u201d\n\nHe explained, \u201cThe benefits of buying a luxury vehicle now are potential tax credits expiring and avoiding higher interest rates [in 2024]. But be sure to get pricing agreements in writing before year\u2019s end to lock in today\u2019s deals. Going this route can mean bigger savings on an already expensive purchase.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no secret that luxury cars offer a superior driving experience,\u201d he added. \u201cThey feature powerful engines, refined handling and luxurious interiors.\u201d\n\nFind Out: Don\u2019t Buy a Car at a Dealership on This Day of the Week\n\nTesla Model S\n\nPrice: approximately $130,000 to $150,000 fully loaded\n\nJones also recommended the Tesla Model S. He noted that the \u201cTesla Model S is a high-tech choice that\u2019s great for tech-lovers. Fully loaded S Plaid+ versions push $150,000, but you get a jaw-dropping acceleration of 0-60 in under 2 seconds! Teslas also tend to have strong resale values down the road.\u201d\n\nScott McAlpin, general manager at Airport Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram located in Orlando, Florida, also suggested the Tesla Model S. He said, \u201cThe Tesla Model S Plaid is a high-performance electric sedan that has redefined the automotive industry. With incredible acceleration, cutting-edge autonomous driving features and a luxurious interior, it offers a unique driving experience. It\u2019s a good investment not only for its performance but also for its electric powertrain, which may become increasingly valuable as the world shifts toward electric vehicles.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nMercedes S-Class\n\nPrice: approximately $110,000 and up\n\nJones believes that the Mercedes S-Class may also be worth the investment. He explained that the \u201cMercedes S-Class is the iconic luxury sedan. Pricing starts at $110,000, but quality, comfort and tech put it top of the line. [It\u2019s] known for high resale prices, too. Its reliability and timeless design make it a safer bet to retain value.\u201d\n\nMcAlpin agreed, \u201cThe Mercedes-Benz S-Class is a symbol of luxury and innovation. It offers an exquisite blend of comfort, technology and performance. Investing in an S-Class means enjoying a vehicle that sets the standard for luxury sedans and is likely to maintain its prestige over time.\u201d\n\nPatryk Doornebos, owner of Car Triple, also recommended the Mercedes S-Class: \u201cStarting at approximately $110,000, this iconic sedan is the epitome of luxury, blending opulent design with state-of-the-art technology. Historically, the S-Class has been a trendsetter in automotive luxury and technology, making it not only a status symbol but also a wise choice for those looking to stay ahead of the curve.\u201d\n\nAudi e-tron GT\n\nPrice: approximately $100,000 and up\n\nMcAlpin noted that people might also want to consider the Audi e-tron GT. He said, \u201cThe Audi e-tron GT is a high-performance electric sports car that combines Audi\u2019s reputation for quality and luxury with eco-friendly technology. Electric vehicles are gaining popularity, making the e-tron GT a forward-looking investment.\u201d\n\nBMW 8 Series\n\nPrice: approximately $85,000 and up\n\n\u201cThe BMW 8 Series is a grand tourer known for its elegant design and potent engines,\u201d stated McAlpin. \u201cIt\u2019s a great investment, because it provides a thrilling driving experience while offering the prestige associated with the BMW brand.\u201d\n\n2023 Aston Martin Vantage\n\nPrice: approximately $140,000 and up\n\nDoornebos said, \u201cWith a starting price of around $140,000, it may seem like a hefty investment. However, delve into its craftsmanship, and you\u2019ll understand its value. It\u2019s aerodynamic design and cutting-edge tech features look like a car from the future. What\u2019s more, Aston Martins historically retain their value well, making them a solid choice for enthusiasts seeking both performance and future resale value.\u201d\n\n2023 Lexus LC 500\n\nPrice: approximately $140,000 and up\n\n\u201cPriced at around $93,000, [the 2023 Lexus LC 500] offers a more affordable entry into the luxury sports coupe segment,\u201d said Doornebos. \u201cLexus has always been synonymous with reliability and customer satisfaction, ensuring that the LC 500 will not just be a pleasure to drive but also an investment with peace of mind.\u201d\n\nMore From GOBankingRates\n\nRobert Kiyosaki's 6 Passive Income Ideas 10 of the Most Valuable Pennies 3 Ways to Recession Proof Your Retirement 18 Ways Your Credit Card Can Be Your Best Financial Friend\n\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: 7 Luxury Cars To Consider Buying Before the Year Ends", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-luxury-cars-consider-buying-140009937.html", "symbols": ["TL0.F", "TL0.XETRA", "TSLA.MX", "TSLA.US", "TSLA34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 1, "neg": 0.019, "neu": 0.78, "pos": 0.201}}, {"date": "2023-11-01T13:31:00+00:00", "title": "Elon Musk Gave More Details About the Tesla Cybertruck\u2014and Showed an Arrow Can\u2019t Penetrate Its Side", "content": "Electric-vehicle firm Tesla plans to make 200,000 Cybertrucks a year, and will offer a \u201cbeast mode\u201d version that goes from zero to 60 mph in three seconds.\n\nContinue reading", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/m/e1dfe93d-11f0-3b20-b284-357454632198/elon-musk-gave-more-details.html", "symbols": ["TL0.F", "TL0.XETRA", "TSLA.MX", "TSLA.US", "TSLA34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0, "neg": 0, "neu": 1, "pos": 0}}, {"date": "2023-11-01T13:21:40+00:00", "title": "The 'Magnificent Seven' stock market leaders went their separate ways in October", "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" tech giants that have led the 2023 stock market rally saw their fortunes diverge in October as earnings, industry narratives, and investor fatigue worked through this group of leaders.\n\n\"At this point you can't look at them as seven stocks together,\" Interactive Brokers chief strategist Steve Sosnick told Yahoo Finance Live on Tuesday.\n\nLast month, Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) were the only members of the group to post gains greater than 1% with the Seattle-area giants rising 4.7% and 7.1%, respectively. Both companies reported quarterly results that revealed growth in their cloud units above investor forecasts.\n\nMeanwhile, rival Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) saw shares drop more than 5% after downbeat results from its cloud business, while Nvidia (NVDA) lost 6% amid reports the Biden administration could limit AI chip exports to China.\n\nTesla (TSLA) stock fell nearly 20% after its latest results showed weaker than expected profits amid an overall concern about the adoption rate of EVs.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) issued softer than expected guidance for the fourth quarter, though the stock finished the month basically flat, rising 0.4%. Apple (AAPL) stock logged a similarly lackluster month, falling 0.3% after a more than 8% drop in September; the iPhone maker will report results on Thursday.\n\nValuations come under scrutiny\n\nThe diverging paths for these names also reflect broader themes weighing on stocks this earnings season.\n\nThe bar to please investors when discussing AI has shifted. Both Microsoft and Amazon passed that test, while investors felt \"too much AI benefit\" might've been embedded into Alphabet's stock, according to Jefferies tech analyst Brent Thill.\n\nTesla, which has at times been swept up in the AI narrative on the back of self-driving ambitions, has had more near-term concerns like slimming margins and the prospects of its Cybertruck launch catching investor attention.\n\nStory continues Tesla's Cybertruck is displayed at Manhattan's Meatpacking District in New York City, U.S., May 8, 2021. REUTERS/Jeenah Moon\n\nThe shift from seemingly any AI promise lifting the major tech players comes as investors have placed more scrutiny on results across the corporate world this earnings season.\n\nWith the Fed's \"higher for longer\" interest rate outlook looming over the overall trajectory of stocks, investors have again resurfaced a debate over whether the run-up in the Magnificent 7 simply pushed stock valuations out too high.\n\n\"There are real risks here,\" Sosnick added. \"These stocks are expensive and it's not like you're taking a risk on a stock that's got a very affordable valuation.\" Magnificent 7 forward price to earnings ratios remain above that of the S&P 500, reflecting that those stocks are more highly valued. (Source: Truist Wealth)\n\n'There's still a lot lacking'\n\nInvestors over the last several months have consistently referenced data showing the majority of the S&P 500's gains this year have been driven by this handful of successful stocks, which account for about 30% of the index's market cap.\n\nBut this momentum can also work in reverse.\n\nAs Bianco Research president Jim Bianco recently pointed out in a post on X, the Magnificent Seven have helped drive down the S&P 500 since mid-summer highs, just as this group once helped the benchmark index rise more than 20% at one point this year.\n\nIndex investors are \"going to feel\" the divergence of the Magnificent Seven as their outsized weighting in the S&P 500 can direct the index's movement, Charles Schwab chief markets strategist Liz Ann Sonders told Yahoo Finance.\n\nBut as Sonders and other Wall Street strategists noted at the start of October, the path toward a \"healthier\" market rally isn't all about these few winners.\n\n\"If you start to see better breadth [outside the Magnificent Seven], I would view that as a positive,\" Sonders said in an interview on Tuesday.\n\nAnd there have been signs of a broadening out, though this trend hasn't fully taken shape, Sonders noted.\n\nThe Russell 2000 recently hit its lowest level since its October 2022 lows. Financials (XLF) are still down more than 5% this year. And even better-than-expected earnings aren't proving to be a major driver.\n\n\"There's a lot that is lacking about what the market has done in the past year and all you have to do is look under the surface of some of those biggest stocks to see what some of those missing links are,\" Sonders said.\n\nSo now as the rising tide of the Magnificent Seven recedes, it's becoming more clear which sectors of the market might have been swimming without a bathing suit during the 2023 rally.\n\nThe question how becomes which of these areas are best positioned to regroup.\n\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.\n\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-magnificent-seven-stock-market-leaders-went-their-separate-ways-in-october-132140735.html", "symbols": ["AAPL.MX", "AAPL.US", "AAPL34.SA", "ABEA.F", "ABEA.XETRA", "ABEC.F", "ABEC.XETRA", "AMZ.F", "AMZ.XETRA", "AMZN.MX", "AMZN.US", "AMZO34.SA", "APC.F", "APC.XETRA", "DJI.INDX", "FB2A.F", "FB2A.XETRA", "GOGL34.SA", "GOGL35.SA", "GOOG.MI"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.996, "neg": 0.032, "neu": 0.869, "pos": 0.099}}, {"date": "2023-11-01T13:15:00+00:00", "title": "Tesla Stock Is Up 67% in 2023.

It\u2019s no secret that CEO Elon Musk is a charismatic figure, and he is able to help support a higher price tag for his company given his historical successes and innovation.\n\nSo valuation alone isn\u2019t necessarily a strong bearish point regarding TSLA stock. However, now appears to be a particularly risky time to hold TSLA stock given its lofty valuation.\n\nThe company\u2019s most recent earnings report was quite underwhelming. The weakening economy is likely to put further pressure on demand for EVs. Rising interest rates are making auto loans increasingly expensive. And the firm\u2019s Cybertruck has run into significant manufacturing challenges.\n\nAdding to that, there is mounting competition from other EV makers; Tesla is hardly the only large player with commercial scale anymore. Tesla has been an incredible success story. But right now, TSLA stock is awfully dangerous to own at more than 60 times forward earnings.\n\nShopify (SHOP) Shopify on the phone display.\n\nSource: Burdun Iliya / Shutterstock.com\n\nE-commerce player Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) has seen its stock slump over the past quarter.

Revenue growth has slowed to about 24% per year and analysts expect a further dip in 2024. That\u2019s not surprising given the increasingly challenging macroeconomic environment.\n\nWhile Shopify is making the best of a complex situation, it\u2019s clear that the 2021 boom days have wound down. Shopify will have to work a lot harder for additional growth than it did during the stay-at-home era. With Shopify turning into a slowing and increasingly mature business, it\u2019s hard to explain the firm\u2019s jaw-dropping 90 times forward P/E ratio.\n\nMercadoLibre (MELI) MercadoLibre (MELI) homepage on a smartphone\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) is Latin America\u2019s leading e-commerce platform. It has also gained momentum as a consumer lending and financial services ecosystem.\n\nThe pitch for MercadoLibre is simple: It will be the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) of Latin America.\n\nThe reality is more complicated. In several countries, such as Mexico, it appears that the Amazon of that place may well be Amazon itself. Amazon Mexico has rapidly caught up to MercadoLibre in that country, despite MercadoLibre having a huge head start. Walmart (NYSE:WMT) has become a powerful omnichannel force in Mexico and Central America as well.\n\nMercadoLibre\u2019s market share is strongest in South American countries like Brazil and Argentina, but unfortunately these tend to be countries with less stable economies and highly volatile currencies.\n\nE-commerce is more challenging in many Latin American markets than the United States. I\u2019ve ordered from MercadoLibre on several occasions in both Mexico and Colombia and ran into hiccups that would be less likely to occur in the U.S.\n\nI\u2019d also note that MercadoLibre\u2019s growth in recent years has been fueled heavily by consumer lending and financial services. In fact, financial services now make up nearly half of revenues. This could run into trouble during a recession in South America, especially as economies like Argentina are facing substantial inflation and currency depreciation at the moment.\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) Palantir Logo. Palantir Technologies (PLTR) is a publicly traded American company that focuses on the specialized field of big data analytics.\n\nSource: Iljanaresvara Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nData analytics firm Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) was founded in May 2003. That means that the company is now officially 20 years old.\n\nAnd it\u2019s been an incredibly hyped-up firm for much of its lifespan. We\u2019re always hearing about new contracts with governments, intelligence groups, and other sophisticated clients. And every time there is a new technology, such as blockchain or AI, there is a whole new enthusiasm cycle around Palantir\u2019s supposed capabilities to conquer this frontier.\n\nDespite all this, however, Palantir\u2019s financial results have been, in my opinion, consistently and thoroughly mediocre. The firm\u2019s lackluster results have led some analysts to describe the firm as a \u201cglorified consultant\u201d rather than a cutting-edge technology innovator.\n\nPalantir has certainly won some impressive contracts and is doing valuable work. But there are many consulting shops that also achieve those ends, and at a significantly higher level of profitability to boot. Even with the current AI excitement now as well, Palantir\u2019s top-line growth remains modest and shares go for more than 65 times forward earnings. That\u2019s not going to cut it in a bear market.\n\nUpstart (UPST) Person holding smartphone with logo of U.S. fintech company Upstart Network Inc. (UPST) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nUpstart (NASDAQ:UPST) is a small consumer lending company that sought to disrupt the loan underwriting space.\n\nThe pitch was that the company\u2019s AI and big data analysis would give it insights that the banks didn\u2019t have.\n\nIn practice, this doesn\u2019t seem to have worked out. Third parties, such as banks, have become increasingly reluctant to buy loans from Upstart. This has forced the company to start taking more loans onto its own balance sheet, putting the company at grave risk if and when these loans run into problems during the next recession.\n\nGiven the lack of end demand, Upstart\u2019s revenues have collapsed. Last quarter, it brought in just $136 million of revenue, which was a 40% year-over-year decline. Needless to say, the company is running massive losses.\n\nUnless Upstart can demonstrate there is some actual edge in its purported AI lending technology, there seems to be little reason for the company to carry on operations. Revenues are plummeting and the upcoming recession could well cause massive credit problems for Upstart\u2019s loans too. Ultimately, I believe UPST will be a penny stock in the not-too-distant future.\n\nWingstop (WING) A close-up of a Wingstop (WING) sign on a green circle background.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nWingstop (NASDAQ:WING) is a franchise restaurant chain known for its various flavors of chicken wings. The company has had tremendous success growing through new store locations, both in the U.S. and internationally.\n\nThe firm had the perfect recipe for thriving during the pandemic. Wingstop has always been focused on superior execution in delivery and app-based ordering as opposed to a rival like Buffalo Wild Wings which spends more on its in-store branding. This proved invaluable for Wingstop during the 2020 era when so much of food service went digital.\n\nHowever, I\u2019d argue that Wingstop\u2019s momentum is likely to slow. Higher inflation is pressuring consumer spending. The rise of the weight loss drugs has caused investors to dump most food stocks (Wingstop excluded). And as momentum fades for delivery-based ordering, Wingstop will face more competition from companies that have a stronger in-store presence.\n\nWingstop is a great business, don\u2019t get me wrong. But it is selling at a spicy 80 times forward earnings. There\u2019s a good chance that valuation comes crashing down when a recession hits.\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) CELH stock: A view of several cases of Celsius energy drinks, on display at a local big box grocery store.\n\nSource: The Image Party / Shutterstock\n\nCelsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) is a drinks company. It is primarily known for its energy drinks and also sells a variety of other functional beverages that serve purposes such as aiding muscle recovery.\n\nThe company has been an absolute growth machine, going from $52 million in revenues in 2018 to an estimated $1.25 billion this year. In a market so dominated by existing soft drink and energy drink companies, this sort of growth rate is tremendous.\n\nHowever, all good things come to an end at some point. Celsius has now achieved broad distribution and is no longer a new product for many consumers. Meanwhile, the inflation and other negative economic factors are likely to impede Celsius\u2019 growth story in the near future.\n\nCelsius has a great brand. Does that make the stock worth 80 times forward earnings? Probably not.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Bezek did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Never miss another market-moving headline.\n\nFord and General Motors upgraded at Barclays\n\nFord Motor (NYSE:F) and General Motors (NYSE:GM) were each upgraded to Overweight from Equalweight at Barclays with price targets of $14.00 and $37.00, as reported in real time on InvestingPro.\n\nThe analysts said they \"believe the different pressures on the business have created 'peak pain,' yielding trading multiples at historical lows.\"\n\nThey added, \"While we acknowledge that structural concerns aren\u2019t likely to dissipate any time soon, we believe even a modest reversal of sharply negative sentiment could drive attractive upside.\"\n\nBarclays said that, of the two, they prefer GM over Ford.\n\nLast week, Ford lost more than 12% after the company reported worse-than-expected Q3 results, disclosing a wider loss in its electric-vehicle business, influenced by a price war sparked by Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). GM beat estimates with its Q3.\n\nBoth automakers retracted their 2023 projection due to uncertainties surrounding negotiations with the United Auto Workers (UAW) union.\n\nFord was recently up 0.5% to $9.80, having retreated from its initial 2% premarket gain. GM also opened with a gain, then reversed to a 0.8% slip to $27.97.\n\nBoeing earns two upgrades\n\nBoeing (NYSE:BA) was upgraded by two Wall Street firms\n\nGoldman Sachs, for one, moved its rating to Conviction Buy from Buy with a price target of $258.00. The analysts commented on the stock's 25% decline since its June air show highs, noting that its current trading below 10X mid-cycle free cash flow suggests investors might be overlooking long-term fundamentals in favor of near-term disruptions.\n\nMeanwhile, Northcoast Research upgraded the company to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $217.00.\n\nStory continues\n\nBoeing shares were lately up 1.7% to $190.02.\n\nSimon Property upped at Goldman\n\nGoldman Sachs upgraded Simon Property Group (NYSE:SPG) to Conviction Buy from Buy with a price target of $144.00.\n\nThe analysts wrote that the high-end mall REIT \"is favorably positioned in a post-pandemic retail environment where its customers \u2014 retailers \u2014 are now looking to expand store footprints in response to consumers who are seeking experience-based consumption options (i.e., in the case of SPG, just going to the mall to shop).\"\n\nGoldman also cited its \"relatively clean balance sheet and at a deep valuation discount versus its peers and its history.\"\n\nShares were recently up 1.8% to $111.85.\n\nJD.com upgraded to Buy\n\nUBS upgraded JD.com (HK:9618) (NASDAQ:JD) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $39.00 (from $40.00), citing the China-based online retailer's \"year of transition.\"\n\nThe analysts noted the company is \"cultivating a vibrant third-party (3P) ecosystem by expanding long-tail SKUs\" as well as \"building low-price mind share and \"streamlining its corporate structure to be more responsive to market change.\"\n\nUBS acknowledged that the \"necessary\" process \"is unlikely to be smooth amid peaking internet user growth, a slowing economy and rising competition\" and that the stock may underperform peers until more visibility materializes, but they still think the stock is undervalued at current levels.\n\nStill, JD.com ADRs were recently down 1.3% to $25.08. Hong Kong shares were off 1.1% to 98.75 Hong Kong dollars.\n\nSaia earns another upgrade\n\nStifel upgraded Saia (NASDAQ:SAIA) to Buy from Hold and raised its price target to $425.00 from $412.00.\n\nEarlier this week, two more Wall Street firms upgraded the company. Wolfe Research raised its rating from Peerperform to Outperform with a price target of $418.00. Meanwhile, Susquehanna upgraded the company from Neutral to Positive with a price target of $420.00.\n\nThe upgrades follow the company\u2019s reported Q3 results last week, with both EPS and revenues coming in better than the consensus estimates.\n\nShares were up 4.3% to $373.86.\n\nStellantis upgraded to Outperform following strong Q3 results\n\nBernstein upgraded Stellantis (NYSE:STLA) to Outperform from Market Perform and raised its price target to $26.40 from $18.50.\n\nThis decision comes on the heels of Stellantis reporting a 7% growth in Q3/23 net revenues, underpinned by strong year-over-year shipments, which led to a more than 3% rise in its stock price Tuesday.\n\nShares lifted 1.7% to $18.99.\n\n***\n\nIn fast-moving markets, every second counts - and InvestingPro subscribers are always one step ahead with lightning-quick updates.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFord, GM bumped to buy; Boeing gets 2 upgrades: 4 big analyst picks\n\nAnalysis-Wavering \u00e2&#128;&#152;Magnificent Seven\u00e2&#128;&#153; draw bargain-hunters amid U.S. stock sell-off\n\nSunPower shares slump after solar company reduces annual outlook", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-gm-bumped-buy-boeing-053951435.html", "symbols": ["8GM.F", "8TI.F", "9618.HK", "BA.MX", "BA.US", "BCO.F", "BCO.XETRA", "BOEI34.SA", "F.MX", "F.US", "FDMO34.SA", "FMC1.F", "FMC1.XETRA", "GM.MX", "GM.US", "GMCO34.SA", "JD.US"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.992, "neg": 0.021, "neu": 0.895, "pos": 0.083}}, {"date": "2023-11-01T01:18:00+00:00", "title": "Netflix Flexes Its Pricing Muscle", "content": "Netflix's premium tier is now nearly twice as expensive as it was a decade ago.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Stocks That Will Skyrocket.\n\nInvestors remain anxious about the Fed\u2019s next move and the upcoming policy decision as they continue to process consumer data to get hints on inflation\u2019s trajectory. While everything in the market has been volatile, one thing that\u2019s constant is the AI frenzy. The AI boom that started with the launch of ChatGPT has no end in sight and it seems companies are just getting started on this front.\n\nNoah Blackstein, senior portfolio manager at Dynamic Funds, recently said while talking to CNBC that AI will transform American businesses that are using the technology to reduce costs and increase productivity. The portfolio manager said that any company using AI to boost efficiency will see success. Blackstein said he\u2019s \u201cnever seen anything like AI before\u201d in terms of ROI, return on productivity and cost savings.\n\nBlackstein said that AI is a secular growth opportunity. He specifically named Snowflake Data Cloud (NYSE:SNOW) and MongoDB (MDB) and said the next successful tech wave will come from data centers, chip companies and software developers.\n\n\u201cThis is the next transformation in technology, but it\u2019s going to have applications in retail, in healthcare, in industrials, and in energy. This is probably a multi-decade and certainly a multi-year phenomenon,\u201d Blackstein said.\n\nAmid the raging AI wave, many stocks are set to skyrocket in the coming months and years. In this backdrop it\u2019s interesting to see what stocks analysts believe can touch new highs.\n\nFor this article we scoured mainstream financial media news outlets and Reddit investing communities to see which stocks retail investors, institutional investors and analysts believe can skyrocket in the next few years. Analysts, institutional and retail investors seem to have a consensus around the ability of some stocks to skyrocket. We went with those names for this article.\n\nStory continues Stocks That Will Skyrocket\n\nLuis Louro / shutterstock.com\n\nStocks That Will Skyrocket\n\n10. CRISPR Therapeutics AG (NASDAQ:CRSP)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 30\n\nGene editing platform company CRISPR Therapeutics AG (NASDAQ:CRSP) is one of the top stocks that will skyrocket in the next 5 to 10 years according to mainstream financial media and credible analysts. The stock\u2019s one-year average price estimate is $88.\n\nAs of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 30 hedge funds out of the 910 fund in Insider Monkey\u2019s database had stakes in Crispr. The biggest stakeholder of the company was Catherine D. Wood\u2019s ARK Investment Management which owns a $412 million stake in the company.\n\n9. Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc (NASDAQ:JAZZ)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 44\n\nAverage analyst price estimate for Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc (NASDAQ:JAZZ) is $201, while the stock is trading at $124 as of October 31. Jazz Pharmaceuticals stock could jump significantly in the next few years on the back of its strong pipeline. Earlier in October Bloomberg reported that Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc (NASDAQ:JAZZ) was in talks to discuss strategic alternatives, including sale. Should the company decides to sell itself and strikes a deal, the stock could skyrocket. If it does not go ahead with a sale, the stock could still jump to higher levels albeit slowly.\n\nAs of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 44 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in the company.\n\nAristotle Capital Global Equity Strategy made the following comment about Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc (NASDAQ:JAZZ) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cDuring the quarter, we sold our position in Magna International and invested in a new position, Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc (NASDAQ:JAZZ). Founded in 2003, Jazz Pharmaceuticals is a global biopharmaceutical company headquartered in Ireland. The drugmaker\u2019s portfolio of nine approved products focuses on conditions with limited therapeutic treatments in neuroscience (~75% of 2022 revenue) and oncology (~25%).\n\nJazz\u2019s drug Xyrem was added to its portfolio in 2005 and was approved for use in patients with narcolepsy. The drug\u2019s strong efficacy propelled it to be the standard of care for this incurable sleep condition and has achieved wide adoption for the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy (episodes of loss of muscle control)\u2026\n\nXyrem\u2019s patent exclusivity ended in January 2023, and authorized generic versions of the product have entered the market. To prepare for the patent cliff, the company developed Xywav, a lower\u2010sodium version of Xyrem, which is touted for its potentially better heart safety. The drug has received FDA approval for the treatment of narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia and has orphan drug exclusivity through 2027\u2026\u201d\n\n8. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 79\n\nTesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is the leader in the EV industry, which is rising and thriving amid a major shift from traditional engines to EVs. Cathie Wood of ARK Invest believes Tesla stock could reach $2000 by 2027.\n\nA total of 79 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Tesla. The biggest stakeholder of the company was Cathie Wood which had a stake over $1 billion in the company.\n\nBaron Partners Fund made the following comment about Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:\n\n\"Many factors contributed to the strong performance of our largest Disruptive Growth position, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), in the period. Investors\u2019 concerns regarding Tesla in 2022 continue to dissipate, and the company\u2019s business has continued to grow materially, although at below peak margins. Tesla\u2019s deliveries in China are recovering. The company\u2019s newest factory in Texas has ramped production and should contribute to improved domestic sales and margins. U.S. government policies have lowered the cost to own Tesla vehicles, while also reducing the company\u2019s battery production expenses.\n\nWe continue to believe that Tesla is only scratching the surface of its potential. We regard announced partnerships between Tesla and its competitors in the quarter as important. In early June, Tesla agreed to provide Ford Motors access to Tesla\u2019s electric vehicle (EV) charging technology and network. Other traditional and pure EV manufacturers, including General Motors, Rivian, and Volvo, quickly followed suit. We expect additional charging partnerships to ensue. In our view, these relationships validate Tesla\u2019s charging technology and infrastructure as superior to other standards. Consolidation around a single technology should accelerate charging infrastructure deployment, diminish the risk of Tesla\u2019s technology becoming obsolete, and lessen a key concern of hesitant EV purchasers. EV adoption is at a tipping point. And Tesla, with its approximately 60% domestic market share of EVs, should be the most important beneficiary of this shift\u2026\u201d\n\n7. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 112\n\nAnalysts believe Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) could quickly catch up with Nvidia\u2019s pace in the AI-based chips industry. Recently, media reports said that Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and Nvidia could launch ARM-based chips as early as 2025. Some analyst believe America\u2019s curb on exports to China would directly affect Nvidia, creating new opportunities for Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD). Analysts are also praising the company\u2019s new Zen 4c architecture processors. They believe the new chips would allow the company to compete against Intel and Nvidia.\n\nArtisan Global Opportunities Fund made the following comment about Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cAmong our top contributors were Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), NU Holdings and Netflix. AMD\u2019s data center CPUs are used in the cloud service provider (CSP) servers. In addition to the broader secular tailwind from cloud adoption, the company has a performance and pricing advantage over Intel, which we believe will enable it to continue capturing market share. However, the recent stock price rally was due to growing excitement around the company\u2019s AI exposure. It will launch its new MI300 graphics processing unit (GPU) chip later this year to compete against the dominant market leader NVIDIA. Similar to its approach that won market share from Intel within the CPU market, AMD\u2019s product will aim to provide similar performance at a more attractive price. AMD is already working with Microsoft and Meta, while Amazon publicly stated that it is evaluating AMD\u2019s inferencing chips. Using assumptions around the total GPU market size, potential market share gains and price points, our research indicates this could be a $20 billion opportunity for AMD. That would nearly double its revenue. While the company has not historically missed many deadlines, there is execution risk as it works to manufacture and distribute these complex chips at scale, which, combined with an elevated valuation after the stock\u2019s strong performance run, led us to trim the position.\u201d\n\n6. Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 112\n\nSome believe Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) shares have become undervalued amid the stock\u2019s consistent underperformance due to crackdowns and restrictions in China. However, Alibaba remains one of the biggest retailers in the world and its fundamentals are strong.\n\nL1 Long Short Fund made the following comment about Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cAlibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) (Long -18%) shares weakened in recent months as Chinese reopening strength faded and macro-economic datapoints began sequentially declining. Nevertheless, we believe the Chinese government will use consumption as a key lever to reinvigorate the economy post-COVID lockdowns. Alibaba remains a high-quality business with leading positions in both eCommerce and Public Cloud, and management is taking proactive steps to unlock shareholder value. It has announced plans to split into six major business groups \u2013 Cloud Intelligence, Taobao Tmall, Local Services, Global Digital, Cainiao Smart Logistics and Digital Media, and Entertainment Group. Each group will be managed independently, with a separate CEO and board, have the flexibility to raise external capital and potentially pursue separate IPOs. We believe this restructure will be a strong positive catalyst to unlock the sum-of-the-parts valuation upside in the company.\u201d\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Stocks That Will Skyrocket.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n30 Dying Professions to Avoid Like a Plague 30 Best Paying Jobs With High School Degrees 20 Highest CPM YouTube Niches in 2023\n\nDisclosure: None. 10 Stocks That Will Skyrocketis originally published on Insider Monkey.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-stocks-skyrocket-214257259.html", "symbols": ["9988.HK", "A1MD34.SA", "AHLA.F", "AHLA.XETRA", "AMD.F", "AMD.MX", "AMD.US", "AMD.XETRA", "BABA.US", "BABA34.SA", "BABAF.US", "CRSP.US", "J7Z.F", "JAZZ.US", "NVD.F", "NVD.XETRA", "NVDA.MX"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 1, "neg": 0.027, "neu": 0.839, "pos": 0.134}}, {"date": "2023-10-31T21:30:58+00:00", "title": "UAW aims to expand union organizing after Big Three deals", "content": "The UAW has reached tentative deals with all of the Big Three automakers Ford (F), General Motors (GM), and Stellantis (STLA), and union president Shawn Fain is looking ahead to expanding union participation.\n\nArthur Wheaton, Cornell University Director of Labor Relations, expects union expansions to broaden out even to EV leader Tesla (TSLA).\n\n\u201cIt's tough to organize an anti-union company,\" Wheaton tells Yahoo Finance, also predicting other auto plants to match Big Three wage hikes for UAW workers.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/video/uaw-aims-expand-union-organizing-213058910.html", "symbols": ["8GM.F", "8TI.F", "F.MX", "F.US", "FDMO34.SA", "FMC1.F", "FMC1.XETRA", "GM.MX", "GM.US", "GMCO34.SA", "STLA.US", "TL0.F", "TL0.XETRA", "TSLA.MX", "TSLA.US", "TSLA34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": -0.026, "neg": 0.015, "neu": 0.971, "pos": 0.014}}, {"date": "2023-10-31T21:28:00+00:00", "title": "Dow Jones Futures: Market Rallies As Tesla Autopilot Scores Big Win; Fed Looms, AMD Battles Late", "content": "The stock market rose Tuesday as Tesla Autopilot won a key battle.

Sales surged, with 1.25 million vehicles sold. This led to a tripling of profits for the first six months of the year. By the third quarter of 2023, its net profit soared to 10.41 billion yuan, marking an 82% increase from 2022. Revenue increased by 38.5% to 162.2 billion yuan.\n\nAdding to its portfolio, BYD\u2019s electronics division recently secured a significant deal with U.S. company Jabil (NYSE:JBL). This 15.8-billion-yuan deal entails the acquisition of Jabil\u2019s mobile electronics production business in China, a move that positions BYD for further growth in both the electronics and transportation sectors.\n\nLi Auto (LI) A front view of the Li Xiang One SUV from Li Auto.\n\nSource: Carrie Fereday / Shutterstock.com\n\nLi Auto (NASDAQ:LI), a Chinese giant in the EV industry, continues its swift ascent. One of its perks is that its vehicles feature extended ranges. These vehicles harness electric power, and once the battery drains, a gasoline engine supplements the energy needs, effectively increasing the driving range.\n\nFinancially, Li Auto has also showcased stellar performance. Its stock is up an impressive 60% YTD. The company\u2019s EPS for the latest quarter stood at 36 cents. From a GAAP perspective, EPS amounted to 30 cents. Moreover, Li Auto recorded revenue of $3.98 billion in Q2.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdding to its achievements, Li Auto recently disclosed the delivery of 36,060 vehicles in September, marking a year-over-year increase of 212.7%. The company\u2019s ambitions are clear, with plans to launch new models in the upcoming year. Plus, the highly anticipated Li MEGA is set for a December release. This vehicle, priced over 500,000 yuan, is anticipated to be one of China\u2019s top-selling cars.\n\nGiven its trajectory, analysts project a bright future for LI stock. That is good news for EV investors.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) supercharging station during the day.\n\nSource: Arina P Habich / Shutterstock.com\n\nDespite disappointing financial results in Q3, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) remains the leading EV manufacturing company in the world, with a market cap above $600 billion. Its target to deliver 1.8 million vehicles by the end of 2023 remains unchanged, which shows Tesla\u2019s resilience in the face of market fluctuations.\n\nHowever, CEO Elon Musk expressed caution about the state of the global economy. He emphasized the company\u2019s focus on making its cars more affordable.\n\nBut analysts are hopeful that the company will perform better in the future. They also believe that Tesla\u2019s stock is undervalued now and that the company is well-positioned to benefit from long-term growth in the EV market.\n\nIn addition, Tesla is ready to introduce its game-changing product, the Cybertruck. With its sharp design and elegant look, consumers already like it. This new product launch is expected to strengthen Tesla\u2019s position in the EV market. Thus, investors should buy Tesla stock now to benefit from the post-Cybertruck rally.\n\nOn the date of publication, Nauman Khan did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

One of them said that the cut off point could be closer to 6 billion euros ($6.33 billion).\n\nMarket conditions would make the IPO, now planned for next spring after being initially readied for the second half of 2023, difficult to pull off even at these valuations, they said.\n\nSeveral European firms, including DKV Mobility, German gearbox supplier Renk and France's Planisware, have recently scrapped plans to go public citing market conditions, while automakers including Tesla have warned of slowing EV growth.\n\nSome analysts had already questioned Renault's hoped-for valuation of up to 10 billion euros, with some suggesting the carmaker should pursue alternative options to raise cash.\n\nThe IPO is part of a radical overhaul plan by Renault CEO Luca de Meo. This includes spinning off Renault's engine business in a partnership with China's Geely and Saudi Arabia's Aramco and overhauling its Nissan alliance.\n\nOne European fund manager, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that given tough market conditions for IPOs Renault might ultimately have to take whatever valuation investors are willing to offer for Ampere to proceed.\n\nRenault, which will hold an investor presentation on the IPO on Nov. 15, said there could be short term market pressure but noted that the EV market share in Europe had risen to 20% in 2023 from 15% in 2022, and that independent studies estimated average annual sectoral revenue growth of 20% or more by 2030.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmpere was the only pure EV player in Europe and \"deserves to trade at multiples closer to its peers with its low-risk exponential growth\", Renault added in an e-mailed statement.\n\nEuropean car manufacturers and policymakers have also voiced concerns over a \"flood\" of cheaper electric cars from China, prompting the European Commission to consider imposing tariffs on imports.\n\nDe Meo said in September that the listing could value Ampere at between 8 and 10 billion euros, above the French carmaker's own current market capitalisation of 9.55 billion euros.\n\nUBS analysts had said on Aug. 31 that Ampere was worth just 3-4 billion euros, warning Renault was one of the groups most exposed to Chinese competitors in Europe.\n\nBarclays analysts recently put a 5 billion euro valuation on Ampere, while last week Bernstein analysts wrote an open letter to de Meo advising him to scrap the IPO and consider selling Renault's 28% stake in Nissan instead to raise cash.\n\nRenault said in its statement that the UBS and Barclays estimates were the lowest published so far, and that analysts did not have all the key metrics to value the company.\n\nOne of the people and a third one said that despite the market climate Renault remained determined for the time being to go ahead with the IPO, which would involve around 20% of Ampere's share capital.\n\nThat would be on top of around 10% of shares that will go to Renault allies Nissan and Mitsubishi, which have pledged to invest up to 800 million euros in Ampere.\n\nThe IPO and the stake sales to Nissan and Mitsubishi would leave Renault holding between 60% and 70% of Ampere, the people said, cautioning that the figures could change.\n\nOther EV makers have seen their market value fall sharply in recent months. Polestar listed at around $20 billion last year but is now worth $4 billion, while shares in Elon Musk's Tesla have lost almost a quarter of their value in less than two months.\n\nThe Ampere IPO would include a mix of Renault's shares and new shares and could happen as early as April 2024, one of the people said, depending on market conditions.

In the days after the company reported profits and sales below analyst expectations, Tesla\u2019s stock spiraled 23%, shaving $189 billion off its market capitalization and $41 billion off Musk\u2019s own net worth. As of Monday, the Tesla CEO had a fortune of $193 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires index.\n\nThe Tesla stock nosedive isn\u2019t the only big loss for Musk this year. Since buying Twitter for $44 billion last October, the company, now known as X, has hemorrhaged $25 billion in value, according to recent reporting from Fortune that was based on an internal valuation by X.\n\nMusk has many huge successes in his business career. But the winning streak has been largely on pause lately as he struggles on a number of fronts.\n\nTesla\u2019s recent earnings, for example, painted a mixed picture for the company. During the earnings call with investors, Musk said, \u201cwe dug our own grave with Cybertruck\u201d because the cars are expensive and complicated to bring to market. The company also won\u2019t reach its yearly output goal of a quarter of a million cars until 2025, Musk said, meaning it won\u2019t be able to produce cars for the 1 million customer reservations it has until years later. Overall, the company had $23.4 billion in quarterly revenue, up 9% year-over-year but short of analysts\u2019 expectations of $24.1 billion. The results have investors questioning whether Tesla is more a moderately-growing car company than the fast-growing tech behemoth Musk promised it could be.\n\nAnother strike against Tesla is that the growth in electric car sales industry-wide is slowing, which makes Musk\u2019s ambitious goals even more of a challenge. Furthermore, car companies are engaged in a price war, which cuts into their profits, particularly because electric cars are typically more expensive to produce than those that run on gasoline.\n\nStory continues\n\nMusk\u2019s wealth is largely tied up in Tesla stock, in which he owns a 13% stake. When the company\u2019s share price peaked around $410 in November 2021, Musk had $340 billion to his name. Now trading at around $200 per share, Musk is worth 40% less.\n\nIn terms of net worth, Musk still remains far ahead of the world\u2019s second-richest person, LVMH chief executive Bernard Arnault, who has a $153 billion fortune.\n\nAt X, Musk has made a series of controversial decisions including laying off 80% of the staff, retiring the Twitter brand, and championing free speech in the face of a deluge of user posts that include racism and harassment. Advertisers have, at least at times, fled.\n\nEarlier this year, Musk hired NBCUniversal ad chief Linda Yaccarino as chief executive to make peace with marketers. Both Musk and Yaccarino say X\u2019s ad business is now thriving\u2014even \u201cclose to breakeven,\u201d as CNN reported\u2014but as a private company, X doesn\u2019t have to report its financials publicly, and any claims about a thriving business have yet to be independently verified.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/elon-musk-lost-25-billion-180512324.html", "symbols": ["TL0.F", "TL0.XETRA", "TSLA.MX", "TSLA.US", "TSLA34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.983, "neg": 0.057, "neu": 0.826, "pos": 0.118}}, {"date": "2023-10-31T17:34:26+00:00", "title": "Tesla wins first US Autopilot trial involving fatal crash", "content": "By Dan Levine and Hyunjoo Jin\n\n(Reuters) -Tesla on Tuesday won the first U.S. trial over allegations that its Autopilot driver assistant feature led to a death, a major victory for the automaker as it faces several other similar lawsuits across the country.\n\nThe case, in a California state court, was filed by two passengers in a 2019 crash who accused the company of knowing Autopilot was defective when it sold the car.

The trial involved gruesome testimony about the passengers' injuries, and the plaintiffs asked the jury for $400 million plus punitive damages.\n\nTesla denied liability, saying Lee consumed alcohol before getting behind the wheel. The electric-vehicle maker also argued it was unclear whether Autopilot was engaged at the time of the crash.\n\nMatthew Wansley, a former general counsel of nuTonomy, an automated driving startup, and associate professor at Cardozo School of Law, said the steering issues in this case differ from those in other cases against Tesla.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn those lawsuits, plaintiffs allege Autopilot is defectively designed, leading drivers to misuse the system. The jury in Riverside, however, was only asked to evaluate whether a manufacturing defect impacted the steering.\n\n\"If I were a juror, I would find this confusing,\" Wansley said.\n\nDuring the trial in Riverside, an attorney for the plaintiffs showed jurors a 2017 internal Tesla safety analysis identifying \"incorrect steering command\" as a defect, involving an \"excessive\" steering wheel angle.\n\nA Tesla lawyer said the safety analysis did not identify a defect, but rather was intended to help the company address any issue that could theoretically arise with the vehicle. The automaker subsequently engineered a system that prevents Autopilot from executing the turn which caused the crash.\n\nTesla won an earlier trial in Los Angeles in April with a strategy of saying that it tells drivers that its technology requires human monitoring, despite the \"Autopilot\" and \"Full Self-Driving\" names.\n\nThat case was about an accident where a Model S swerved into the curb and injured its driver, and jurors told Reuters after the verdict that they believed Tesla warned drivers about its system and driver distraction was to blame.

They were all trillion-dollar companies.\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) led the list with a market capitalization of $2.7 trillion. As the month progressed, Apple\u2019s market cap dropped by about $70 billion, while the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector Index lost more than 4.5%.\n\nThere\u2019s no question that the markets are struggling here in the final quarter of the year. The S&P 500 traded very close to 4,600 in late July. Its gain for the year is down to single digits (7.7% as of Oct. 27).\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThings have deteriorated to the point where Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is teetering on the line between a trillion-dollar company and a large market cap.\n\nIt would be easy for me to pick Nvidia as the company most likely to hit the trillion-dollar mark. Too easy. So, for the purposes of this article, Nvidia is excluded from the selection process.\n\nHere are three future trillion-dollar companies that appear reasonably priced to undervalued.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla Motors (TSLA) now an SP500 company with a busy Pond Springs location in northwest Austin, TX\n\nSource: Roschetzky Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is the only one of the three that has the possibility of hitting a trillion-dollar market cap in 2024. Its volatility works for and against its share price movement.\n\nWith a current market cap of $650 billion, it traded for nearly double in November 2021. In fact, it officially joined the trillion-dollar club on October 25th, 2021, only to fall out in the following spring.\n\nThe biggest issue holding back Tesla from reentering the trillion-dollar companies club are the worries that the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) will take much longer than initially anticipated, making Tesla\u2019s EV price reductions a permanent thing, and a drag on revenues and profits.\n\n\u201cBut the EV market is wobbling as high interest rates dampen customer demand for electric and other vehicles. That\u2019s \u2018preventing a lot of people from even getting into the market,\u2019 Jessica Caldwell, head of insights at Edmunds, told Fortune.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nAs Fortune reported, Tesla\u2019s latest quarterly earnings per share\u00a0were 10% lower than analyst expectations, and the lowest in the past eight quarterly reports. The poor results shaved nearly $140 billion off its market cap, making the move to a trillion that much more difficult.\n\nSomething positive has to happen to change the trajectory of its stock. However, of all the S&P 500 stocks with a market cap greater than $100 billion, it\u2019s the only one that has a shot in 2024.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) The logo for Berkshire Hathaway displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs much as I love Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B), it is not a high growth company. With a current market cap of $724 billion, its share price would have to increase by 38% to push its market cap over $1 trillion.\n\nCan this happen in 2024? Sure, it\u2019s possible, but not probable. According to Berkshire\u2019s 2022 shareholder letter, its share price has increased by 30% annually on 20 occasions since 1965. The most recent occurrence in 2013, up 32.7%. Before that, it was 1998 (52.2%).\n\nNow, if its share price increases by 17.5% annually over the next two years, it can get to $1 trillion. Since 2013, its share price has met this level 50% of the time. That\u2019s very doable.\n\nThe big thing that will prevent it from getting there in the next two years would be the death of Warren Buffett. That would most certainly send shares lower. How long they would remain low would depend on the transition plan and how well it is executed.\n\nKnowing Buffett, that won\u2019t be a problem. Berkshire\u2019s already revealed that Greg Abel, the person in charge of its non-insurance operating businesses, will be the next CEO after Buffett dies or steps down.\n\nIn March, Abel added to his Berkshire stock, bringing his total stake to $105 million, more than enough incentive to keep growing the business after the Buffett/Munger era officially ends.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nI picked Visa (NYSE:V) because I thought its consistency would help its share price continue higher despite a possible recession in 2024. Sure, its overall business is driven by transactions processed for bank credit cards, etc., which would likely drop in such an event, but it remains an excellent business that trades at a reasonable value.\n\nVisa\u2019s current market cap\u00a0is $464 billion, meaning it would have to double and then some for it to enter the trillion-dollar club. That\u2019s unlikely to happen in the next 2-3 years.\n\nHowever, if the company continues to invest in technology to keep pace with the fintech industry, I don\u2019t see why it can\u2019t happen within the next five years.\n\nVisa recently announced a $100 million generative AI venture fund that will invest in up-and-coming businesses that are the \u201cnext generation of companies focused on developing generative AI technologies and applications that will impact the future of commerce and payments.\u201d\n\nVisa has utilized artificial intelligence (AI) since 1993, so it knows a thing or two about machine learning and the part it will play in the financial services industry.\n\nYou\u2019ll notice that Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), the company in the S&P 500 closest to $1 trillion, is not on my trillion-dollar companies list. I feel there are too many uncertainties with social media at the moment to warrant inclusion.\n\nMaybe next year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

According to data compiled by FactSet, 73% of S&P 500 listed companies have reported better-than-expected earnings, and 66% have announced better revenue than had been anticipated among professional analysts. Overall, that\u2019s a pretty good track record. However, there have been plenty of hits and misses among some notable names this earnings period. While some companies have knocked the cover off the ball, others have struck out badly, sending their share prices plummeting as a result. With markets continuing to trend lower and on track to record a loss for the month of October, investors don\u2019t appear to be in a forgiving mood. Companies that have missed expectations for Q3 are seeing their stocks punished. Here are Q3 earnings winners and losers to rethink \u2014 three stock duds and four studs.\n\nQ3 Earnings Dud: Canada Goose (GOOS) canada goose (goos) logo on the sleeve of a jacket\n\nSource: rblfmr / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt\u2019s a bad time to be selling winter parkas with the world warming at an alarming rate and wildfires raging across much of the planet. That partly explains why Canada Goose (NYSE:GOOS) laid an egg with its most recent financial results, pushing the company\u2019s share price down to an all-time low. Canada Goose reported a net loss of $85 million for its fiscal 2024 first quarter. Revenue in the quarter rose 21% from a year earlier to $84.8 million, which was ahead of analysts\u2019 estimates. However, the forward guidance provided by Canada Goose was a disaster.\n\nThe luxury parka maker forecast fiscal second-quarter revenue of $270 million to $290 million, below analyst estimates of $298.5 million. The company added that it foresees a net loss per share of between 17 and 24 cents compared with forecasts for a profit of 6 cents in fiscal Q2. Sales of luxury goods in the U.S. and elsewhere have been slowing in recent months due to high inflation and rising interest rates. Analysts were quick to downgrade GOOS stock. Both Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) and TD Cowen dropped the stock to a Hold, citing a weak economic outlook in both the U.S. and China.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGOOS stock is now down 36% on the year and trading at a 52-week low, which is also an all-time low.\n\nFord Motor (F) Ford dealership sign against a blue sky.\n\nSource: D K Grove / Shutterstock.com\n\nShares of Ford Motor (NYSE:F) dropped 10% immediately after the Detroit automaker issued a disappointing Q3 print and pulled its forward guidance. To be fair, the bad numbers and guidance pull were due almost entirely to the six-week labor strike the company endured at the hands of the United Auto Workers (UAW) union. That said, the cost of the strike and its long-term negative impacts are only now emerging, and it\u2019s not looking good. Ford said the strike cost it $1.3 billion in lost production and said it plans to delay $12 billion in previously announced electric vehicle investments, including postponing construction of an electric vehicle battery plant in Kentucky, due to the labor disruption.\n\nFor Q3, Ford reported earnings per share (EPS) of 39 cents compared to 45 cents expected on Wall Street. Revenue in the quarter totaled $41.18 billion versus $41.22 billion expected. Citing the strike, Ford pulled its forward guidance for the remainder of this year. If there\u2019s a silver lining, it\u2019s that Ford\u2019s miserable Q3 print arrived a day after the Detroit automaker reached a tentative deal with the UAW, bringing the strike to an end. Analysts at Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB) calculated the new labor deal, which runs over four and a half years, will cost Ford $6.2 billion. The new collective agreement provides 25% pay increases. F stock is down 15% on the year and also at a 52-week low.\n\nQ3 Earnings Dud: Tesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) on stock market. Tesla financial success and profit.\n\nSource: Rokas Tenys / Shutterstock.com\n\nTesla\u2019s (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock has fallen nearly 20% since the electric vehicle maker issued an underwhelming Q3 print in mid-October. The company, led by CEO Elon Musk, missed Wall Street\u2019s forecasts in nearly every category and provided weak forward guidance. Tesla reported Q3 EPS of 66 cents and revenue of $23.4 billion. Analysts who track the company\u2019s progress had expected a profit of 73 cents and sales of $24.1 billion for the July through September period. Tesla\u2019s EPS was down 37% from a year earlier, and its gross profit margin was 16.3%, below the 17.2% forecast on Wall Street.\n\nTesla executives said the company\u2019s price cuts this year are likely to continue as it tries to boost slumping sales. The company has slash prices aggressively this year to help drive sales volumes amid rising interest rates and growing competition from other automakers. The average price of a Tesla vehicle is now $10,000 less than it was a year ago, according to the company. Musk also dampened expectations for the upcoming release of Tesla\u2019s Cybertruck, saying it will likely take a year or longer before the electric pick-up truck is a significant profit contributor.\n\nTSLA stock is now trading 9% lower than where it was a year ago.\n\nQ3 Earnings Studs: Deckers Outdoor (DECK) Deckers Outdoor (DECK) logo displayed on smartphone screen\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Piotr Swat\n\nTalk about an earnings bounce. The stock of Deckers Outdoor (NYSE:DECK) rose nearly 20% immediately after the company announced its financial results. The big move comes after the maker of Ugg boots and Hoka running shoes reported record sales and profits for the company\u2019s second fiscal quarter of 2024. Specifically, Deckers reported EPS of $6.82, well ahead of the $4.43 forecast on Wall Street. Revenue in the quarter increased 24.7% year-over-year to $1.09 billion, topping the consensus estimate of $960.62 million among analysts. Both the earnings and revenue were records.\n\nExecutives at Deckers Outdoor attributed the stellar results to continued demand for its Ugg boots and Hoka sneakers. The company also reported that its direct-to-consumer sales rose 38.8% to $331.7 million, while its wholesale sales grew 19.4% to $760.2 million during the quarter. Looking ahead, Deckers said it now expects EPS of $22.90 to $23.25, and revenue of $4.025 billion for its entire fiscal year. Both estimates are ahead of Wall Street forecasts. DECK stock has gained nearly 50% on the year and is trading near a 52-week high.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) a pedestrian walks past a Chipotle\n\nSource: Northfoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill\u2019s (NYSE:CMG) third-quarter financial results topped Wall Street expectations as the quick service restaurant chain raised prices charged for its burritos and other menu items. The company reported EPS of $11.36 compared to $10.55 \u2014 the consensus expectation among analysts. Revenue in Q3 totaled $2.47 billion, which was in line with forecasts. Chipotle\u2019s prices were 2.8% higher in Q3 than a year ago due to price hikes implemented in autumn 2022. Earlier this October, Chipotle raised its menu prices for the first time in more than a year, citing rising food inflation as the reason.\n\nDuring their Q3 earnings call with analysts and media, Chipotle executives said the company has pricing power, or the ability to raise prices without alienating customers. Chipotle\u2019s Q3 same-store sales rose 5%, beating estimates of 4.6%. The company credited higher transactions and menu prices for the same-store sales growth. Also during the July through September period, Chipotle opened 62 new restaurant locations, 54 of which have a drive-thru lane reserved for picking up digital orders. The company plans to open 285 to 315 new restaurants in 2024.\n\nCMG stock gained 5% after the Q3 print and is up 38% year-to-date.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nE-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) reported its best quarterly results since the pandemic, beating Wall Street forecasts across the board following a year of cost cutting measures. For Q3, Amazon announced EPS of 94 cents, which trounced the 58 cents expected among Wall Street analysts. Revenue in Q3 came in at $143.1 billion compared to $141.4 billion that was anticipated. Cloud-computing unit Amazon Web Services (AWS) posted sales of $23.1 billion versus the $23.2 billion forecasted. Advertising revenue totaled $12.1 billion compared to the anticipated $11.6 billion.\n\nAmazon added that its core e-commerce business saw sales growth of 7% year-over-year in Q3 after expanding 4% in this year\u2019s second quarter. The Q3 numbers include the results from Amazon\u2019s July Prime Day, which the company called its \u201cbiggest ever\u201d sales event. Additionally, digital advertising revenue increased 26% in Q3 from a year earlier, and AWS saw growth in the quarter of 12%. Amazon\u2019s cost cutting measures earlier in the year helped boost its profit margins, with the company reporting a Q3 operating margin of 7.8%, the highest level in two years.\n\nAMZN stock jumped 7% higher after the Q3 print, bringing its year-to-date gains to 49%.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) An image of a phone with the Netflix logo on the screen, laying next to a container of popcorn with popcorn splayed across\n\nSource: xalien / Shutterstock\n\nNetflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) stock is up 16% since the company reported strong Q3 financial results that crushed analysts\u2019 forecasts. The streaming giant is back in investors\u2019 good graces after reporting EPS of $3.73, which was ahead of the consensus estimate among analysts of $3.49. Revenue for the three months ended Sept. 30 totaled $8.54 billion, which matched forecasts. However, the figure that really moved NFLX stock was a much better-than-expected increase in paid subscriptions. The company added 8.8 million net new subscribers in Q3.\n\nNetflix also issued strong guidance, forecasting revenue of $8.70 billion for the fourth quarter compared with the consensus Wall Street view of $8.78 billion. The strong results were all the more impressive given that they arrived during an ongoing strike by Hollywood actors that has shutdown film and television production worldwide. Netflix said the positive quarter was due in large part to increased subscription fees and improving profitability. The company now expects a profit margin of 20% for all of this year, which is at the high end of its previous guidance of 18% to 20%. NFLX stock is up 35% year-to-date.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole\u00a0held a long position in DECK.

After all, with this EV power charging station technology company, which once traded for prices north of $40 per share, now changing hands for around $2.50 per share, surely the market has oversold it, right?\n\nNot so fast. Yes, macro developments have resulted in poor performance for early-stage growth stocks like this one, but there is a very good company-specific reason investors have abandoned the stock, and why the short side of this trade has become very crowded.\n\nWhy CHPT Stock is Hitting New All-Time Lows\n\nDespite ChargePoint\u2019s poor performance, I can see why some may be bullish while the crowd is bearish. For one, it\u2019s not as if this stock has received a spate of bearish analyst ratings lately.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn fact, quite the contrary. Since September, sell-side analysts from both RBC and UBS have initiated coverage on CHPT stock, issuing \u201cBuy\u201d or equivalent to \u201cBuy\u201d ratings on shares. It\u2019s not as if there\u2019s been a complete lack of positive news regarding ChargePoint, either.\n\nAs discussed last week, the company just recently announced that its rolling outTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) compatible chargers throughout its charging network, which is the largest in the United States. Yet while there has been this bit of positive news, a massive piece of negative news has significantly outweighed it. Hence, why above I referred to shares falling for a \u201cvery good reason.\u201d\n\nOn Oct. 11, ChargePoint announced it has raised $232 million in new capital, through the sale/issuance of new shares. Following this news, CHPT\u2019s downward decline has accelerated. The stock keeps hitting new all-time lows. Yes, this sell-off may soon ease. Shares could hit a short-term floor. However, if this happens, don\u2019t assume it means the dust has settled.\n\nStory continues\n\nDon\u2019t Expect the Short Side to Soon Cover\n\nThe level of short interest with CHPT stock has creeped up in a big way. According to Fintel, on Dec. 30, 2022, around 18.13% of CHPT\u2019s outstanding float was sold short.\n\nToday, short interest stands at well over a quarter of outstanding float (nearly 28%). Not only that, short interest has sped up just in the past week, as it was at just 22.65% of float as recently as Oct. 23. It would be one thing if ChargePoint\u2019s short interest was coming down after the capital raise news.\n\nIt\u2019s another thing entirely that the \u201cshort side,\u201d typically considered some to be the \u201csmart money\u201d among market participants, are increasing their bearish wagers. Sure, sometimes even the \u201csmart money\u201d can make unwise trading decisions, getting squeezed.\n\nHowever, weighing the capital raise news against ChargePoint\u2019s fundamentals, it makes sense why short interest is rising, not falling.\n\nReporting another quarter of heavy losses ($125.25 million) last quarter, ChargePoint needs to scale up in order to hit profitability.\n\nUnfortunately, given that EV sales growth is slowing down, it\u2019s becoming increasingly doubtful that ChargePoint will soon swing to profitability. Further disappointment, and more importantly, more dilutive fundraising, may be ahead.\n\nAdd in Other Red Flags and the Verdict is Clear\n\nBesides the risk of ChargePoint needing to sell more shares once again down the road, further watering down returns for investors, there are some other red flags that should give any CHPT contrarian pause.\n\nCompetition in the EV charging station space is intense, with this company having to compete with not only other fledgling startups, but with Tesla\u2019s own Supercharger network.\n\nIn addition, it\u2019s not just been the company itself that\u2019s been selling shares. Insider selling has been high as well. One ChargePoint director sold $13.4 million worth of shares in September.\n\nAdd it all together, and the verdict is clear. Stay away from CHPT stock. It may appear that you can buy today, and profit as shares recharge on improved sentiment, yet a closer look suggests you\u2019ll just get zapped instead.\n\nCHPT stock earns an F rating in Portfolio Grader.\n\nOn the date of publication, neither Louis\u00a0Navellier nor the InvestorPlace Research Staff member primarily responsible for this article held (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nChatGPT IPO Could Shock the World, Make This Move Before the Announcement Musk\u2019s \u201cProject Omega\u201d May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.
