[{"date": "2024-03-20T22:10:29+00:00", "title": "12 Best Alternatives to a 4-Year College", "content": "In this article, we will look at the 12 best alternatives to a 4-year college. We have also discussed the decreasing value of college degrees. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Best Alternatives to a 4-Year College.\n\nIn recent years, there has been a growing emphasis on alternatives to traditional four-year college degrees due to several factors. One major reason is the rising cost of higher education, which has led many individuals to seek more affordable options. Additionally, the job market's evolving nature demands a broader range of skills and competencies, prompting a shift towards alternative pathways such as vocational training, apprenticeships, and online certifications.\n\nHowever, it's essential to acknowledge the lasting benefits of a four-year college degree. Beyond providing specialized knowledge in a particular field, a bachelor's degree often cultivates critical thinking, communication, and problem-solving skills that are valuable across various professions. Moreover, a college education opens doors to a broader range of career opportunities and typically leads to higher earning potential over the long term. In fact, there are easy college degrees that are quite high paying as well.\n\nIt is interesting to note that Liberal Arts is one of the easiest 4 year degrees to get. However, Liberal Arts is also one of the most useless associate degrees if you want high-paying jobs.\n\nMoreover, data from the Burning Glass Institute highlights a decline in jobs requiring a college education, dropping from 51% in 2017 to 44% in 2021. Similarly, Gallup reports a stark decline in the percentage of young adults viewing college education as \"very important,\" plummeting from 74% to 41% within six years.\n\nCompanies like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) are redefining hiring criteria, recognizing the value of life experiences over formal education. This sentiment is echoed in findings from Georgetown University, revealing that while a bachelor's degree holder may earn $2.8 million over a lifetime, non-degree holders can still expect $1.6 million in earnings, challenging conventional notions of the economic benefits of higher education.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, in 2016, International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM) introduced \"new collar\" roles, emphasizing transferable skills over bachelor's degrees. By 2020, 15% of hires included positions like application developer and cyber security specialist. In 2021, International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM)\u00a0 eliminated degree requirements for over half its US openings. The P-TECH program aided underprivileged students in acquiring tech skills and securing International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM)\u00a0 internships. While International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM)\u00a0 maintains lower degree requirements for roles like software QA engineer and network administrator, just 31% of software developer/engineer positions mandate a degree \u2014 the lowest among tech competitors per Burning Glass Institute data.\n\nFurthermore, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics reports an average of 12 job changes over a career, emphasizing the importance of adaptable skills garnered from varied experiences. Initiatives such as Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u2019s career certificates and innovative programs like Minerva University's immersive learning confirm the growing emphasis on experiential learning.\n\nAnother observation we tend to find is that inflation, whether in currency or credentials, obeys the principles of supply and demand. Just as rare items like vintage baseball cards command high prices due to scarcity, rare skills in the job market yield high wages. However, the widespread adoption of college degrees as a signaling tool has led to their devaluation. With 99.5 million Americans now holding bachelor's degrees, the once-esteemed credential has become commonplace. This phenomenon, known as credential inflation, sees jobs that once required only a high school diploma now demanding a bachelor's degree. Consequently, many recent graduates find themselves overqualified for low-paying jobs, contributing to underemployment rates.

Get an Associate Degree at a Community College\n\nIM Score: 21\n\nGetting an Associate Degree at a Community College offers several advantages over a 4-year college degree.

Additionally, freelancing offers the opportunity to work on diverse projects, fostering continuous learning and skill development. With the rise of remote work and digital platforms, freelancers can access global opportunities, transcending geographical limitations. In exceptional cases, it is one of the easiest and high paying alternatives to a 4 year college degree.\n\n9.

The real-world experience can often be more immediately applicable to a career path than theoretical learning in a college setting. To read more about this, see the highest paying entry level jobs with no experience.\n\n8. Join Apprenticeship Programs\n\nIM Score: 26\n\nApprenticeship programs are one of the most popular alternatives to college degree as offer hands-on experience and specialized training, often tailored to specific industries, providing immediate applicability of skills. For instance, in fields like software development, apprenticeships such as Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u2019s apprenticeship program offer direct mentorship from industry experts, real-world projects, and potential job placement.\n\n7. Get Microcredentials and Nanodegrees\n\nIM Score: 27\n\nMicrocredentials and Nanodegrees offer focused, specialized learning tailored to immediate industry needs, providing a quicker pathway to acquiring relevant skills compared to a traditional 4-year degree. For instance, in fields like Data Science, professionals may opt for a Nanodegree in Machine Learning Engineer, which equips them with specific skills sought after in the industry. In 2024, it is definitely a good alternative to a 4 year college degree.\n\nThe Alpahebet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Udacity Nanodegree program offers courses in various fields like data science, artificial intelligence, and web development. Each Nanodegree typically consists of several courses, providing hands-on projects and personalized feedback. Learners can access video lectures, quizzes, and community support. Completion time varies, with programs ranging from 3 to 12 months.\n\n6. Join the Military Services\n\nIM Score: 30\n\nMilitary service provides hands-on experience in a variety of roles, including technical, logistical, and tactical positions, which can translate directly into civilian careers. Additionally, the military often offers financial support for further education, including assistance with tuition fees and specialized training programs.

If you want to skip our discussion about smart trackers, go to the 3 Best AirTag Alternatives That Are Actually Worth Buying.\n\nSmart Bluetooth Trackers like Apple's AirTags are emerging as pivotal components in an era of technological advancements. The market is expected to experience an impressive cumulative annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.6% during the forecast period of 2021 to 2030. It was valued at $583 million in 2021 and is expected to reach a market size of $1,655 million by 2030.\n\nIt is worth noting that smart trackers are a part of the much larger Internet of Things (IoT) market. The IoT market, as a whole, is experiencing even higher growth and is expected to reach $2,703 billion by 2032. Its growth is driven by automation, big data demand, and advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML).\n\nSome of the factors influencing the growth of smart trackers include the rising number of smartphone owners. However, growth will be primarily driven by high-end phone users such as those of Apple's iPhones and Samsung's flagship phones.\n\nAirTag was launched with the motive of preventing the stealing and misplacing of iPhones. It was introduced as an accessory that works with Apple's Find My app to help users keep track of and find things that are important to them. However, users have found various uses for AirTags and other Bluetooth smart trackers, including pet surveillance.\n\nWhile the smart tracker market is on a trajectory of growth, it has significant challenges ahead of it. There are concerns over privacy, data security, and technological obsolescence. A host of legal issues are being raised, which might shift the regulatory environment against them. More recently, an attempted class action lawsuit against Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:APPL) is being allowed to proceed because the judge was convinced that there are negligence issues surrounding the AirTags trackers. However, since leading tech companies have already invested quite alot in their smart trackers, they are ready to take proactive measures and innovations to address these challenges.\n\nStory continues\n\nDevices like Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:APPL)'s AirTags epitomize the fusion of innovation and utility. These Bluetooth smart trackers employ an array of technologies, including GPS, WiFi, RFID, and cellular networks to provide real-time or near-real-time monitoring and location tracking.\n\nCurrently, the market is headed towards improving the ecosystem and app enhancement. Companies opening in the industry are building comprehensive ecosystems around their tracking devices, which go a mile or two beyond basic tracking. Creating and implementing a perfect ecosystem often involves the use of numerous technologies, including geofencing capabilities, crowd-sourced location tracking, and integration with other smartphone and IoT devices.\n\nOther trends prevalent in the market include a multi-technology approach and a focus on power efficiency and battery life. Most smart trackers today combine GPS, Bluetooth, and WiFI to ensure robust and efficient tracking solutions. In addition, manufacturers are now prioritizing extended battery life through efficient designs and optimized usage patterns.\n\nSome of the key players in the market include Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:APPL), Tile, and Samsung. Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:APPL)'s AirTags leads the market and are still the most popular type of tracking device. However, these can only be used with iPhones, which is why it is worth having a look at the best AirTag alternatives if you are an Android user. Tille is another prominent company that specializes in Bluetooth trackers for personal belongings. On the other hand, Samsung leverages its global presence to offer diverse smart tracking solutions.\n\nBefore diving into the list of the best AirTag alternatives, it is worth knowing how smart trackers and AirTag work. These trackers utilize a blend of wireless technologies, including Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and Ultra-wideband (UWB) to track personal belongings. In the case of AirTag, it sends out a secure Bluetooth signal that nearby devices can detect within the Find My network. These devices then send the location of AirTag into the owner's iCloud. While this is a smart approach, it also has a drawback as an AirTag needs an iPhone nearby to function.\n\nWith that backdrop, let's look at the 8 best Apple AirTag alternatives that are actually worth buying.  8 Best AirTag Alternatives That Are Actually Worth Buying\n\nMethodology\n\nTo curate our list of the 8 best AppleAirtag alternatives that are actually worth buying, we devised an original methodology. First, we went to online forums to understand what people actually want in their smart trackers, and we boiled it down to the following factors: battery life, Bluetooth tracking range, affordability, and protection. After looking at several smart trackers and their features, we devised a point system.\n\nFor battery life, we awarded 2 points to trackers that last a couple of days, 4 points to those that last a couple of weeks, and 5 points to those that last more than a month. For tracking range, we awarded 2 points for 10 meters or less, 3 points for 11 meters to 60 meters, 4 points for 61 to 100 meters, and 5 points for more than 100 meters range. For affordability, we awarded 3 points to trackers that cost more than $40, 4 points to those that cost less than $40 but more than $25, and 5 points to those that cost less than $25. For protection, we awarded 2 points to those that came with no protection, 3 points to weather resistant, 4 points to water resistant, and 5 points to waterproof trackers. Then, for each tracker, we summed the total and averaged it to arrive at the Insider Monkey Rating. The higher this rating, the higher the tracker ranked on our list.\n\nAs tie breakers, we used tracking range, battery life, and affordability in order. For all the points awarded, we tried to refer to user experience rather than the company's claim. It is worth noting that one of the trackers in our list is a pet collar, which we included because AirTags are sometimes used for pet surveillance.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a similar consensus approach we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).

Per a Future Market Insights report, the global digital map market is expected to reach $73.1 billion by 2033, witnessing a CAGR of 14.8% between 2023 and 2033.\r\n\r\nMoreover, growing Google Maps efforts will further bolster its Android offerings. This, in turn, will boost its Google Services segment, which remains the key growth catalyst for the company. Its shares have rallied 45.9% in the past year compared with the Zacks Computer & Technology sector\u2019s growth of 44.6%.\r\n\r\nThe strengthening Google Services segment is expected to aid its overall financial performance in the near term.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 total revenues stands at $286.48 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 11.7%.\n\nStory continues\n\nStiff Competition\n\nStrengthening Google Maps offerings will aid Alphabet to compete well with some notable industry players like Microsoft MSFT and Apple AAPL, which have positioned themselves well in the digital map space.\r\n\r\nApple is riding on the success of its Apple Maps offerings.\r\n\r\nApple\u2019s launch of Apple Business Connect, a free tool enabling businesses to manage their location place cards and customize information for over a billion users on Apple Maps, including adding photos, logos and promotions, remains noteworthy.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Microsoft is enjoying the growing momentum of Bing Maps with new feature updates.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft introduced live traffic updates on Bing Maps, enabling users to plan their journeys more efficiently by providing real-time information about traffic conditions during commutes.\n\nZacks Rank & A Stock to Consider\n\nCurrently, Alphabet carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\r\n\r\nA better-ranked stock in the broader technology sector is CrowdStrike CRWD, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

I wrote that the media houses were unlikely to win. Well, they just did. And as with everything else these days, AI suddenly became part of the equation.\n\nThis morning, the French competition authority fined Google \u20ac250 million ($271 million) for failing to comply with commitments it made a couple years ago regarding how it would negotiate the fees with the French news outlets. Google already received a \u20ac500 million fine over the matter in 2021. It\u2019s not arguing back this time, which has probably spared it an even higher fine.\n\nI\u2019m not going to go into the details of the revised negotiation process to which Google has agreed\u2014it\u2019s as dull as it sounds and, if you really want to dive in, here\u2019s Google\u2019s statement in French and English. The interesting part of this episode is about Google\u2019s Bard AI, which these days goes by the name of Gemini.\n\nAs far as I\u2019m aware, this is the first fine to be levied on an AI company at least partially because of its free-wheeling incorporation of everything it can grab into its training data.\n\nAccording to the French Competition Authority (FCA) the fine takes account of the fact that Google \u201cused content from press agencies and publishers to train its [Bard] foundation model, without notifying either them or the\u00a0[FCA].\u201d\n\nAs Google tells it, the FCA \u201cdoes not challenge the way web content is used to improve newer products like generative AI.\u201d Google claimed this issue is \u201calready addressed\u201d in Article 4 of the EU Copyright Directive, which provides an exception for text and data mining, and in the upcoming EU AI Act, which tells AI companies to respect the Copyright Directive (and to publish \u201csufficiently detailed\u201d summaries of their training data).\n\nBut according to the FCA, the question of whether article-scraping AI companies qualify for that text and data mining exception \u201chas not yet been settled.\u201d It said Google had \u201cat the very least\u201d broken its commitment to be transparent in its commercial dealings with French news publishers, making this a fining matter.\n\nStory continues\n\nNow, Google did recently launch a new control in the robots.txt file that web publishers use to send signals to Google\u2019s web crawlers. The setting is called Google-Extended, and it\u2019s supposed to let publishers opt out of having their data become Bard/Gemini training fodder without also having their articles disappear from Google Search and Google News.\n\nBut it only added that control at the end of September, more than two months after Bard\u2019s European launch. During that period, French publishers effectively had to allow the unrestricted hoovering of their output into Bard if they also wanted it to appear in Search and News\u2014which, remember, is how they then get to claim ancillary copyright fees from Google. That broke another of Google\u2019s commitments, again contributing to today\u2019s fine. The FCA also told Google to explain to publishers how the opt-out mechanism works.\n\nSo in summary, Google\u2019s new control for publishers has belatedly fixed one of the issues with the unpaid incorporation of news articles into its AI training material, but the overall legality of this practice under EU copyright law remains an open question. It\u2019s not hard to see why Google's big rival, OpenAI, has started cutting licensing deals with European press publishers like Axel Springer and Le Monde.\n\nOne final note while we\u2019re on the subject of Big Tech and European antitrust regulators: Margrethe Vestager, the European Commission\u2019s competition chief, just told Reuters that Apple may face a probe over the \u20ac0.50-per-app-installation \u201ccore technology fee\u201d it\u2019s levying on developers who dare to use the third-party iOS app stores that Apple must allow under the new EU Digital Markets Act. \u201cThere are things that we take a keen interest in, for instance, if the new Apple fee structure will de facto not make it in any way attractive to use the benefits of the DMA,\u201d she said.\n\nGiven that Microsoft and Meta have both complained to Vestager that the fee makes third-party app stores unviable, there\u2019s a storm a-coming, and I do not hate to say I told you so.

Compared to the Magnificent Seven, IBM\u2019s 19% gain this year, including dividends, trails only Nvidia Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc.\n\n\u201cIBM has been discounted by the rest of the industry, but it has made a lot of investments in both cloud and AI, and with a strong AI business, we could see growth inflecting higher,\u201d said Jethro Townsend, portfolio manager at Nia Impact Capital. He cites the firm\u2019s cash flow generation and \u201chealthy\u201d dividend yield as factors that provide room for it to re-rate higher.\n\nMuch of the year\u2019s advance followed IBM\u2019s results in late January, when it gave a better-than-expected forecast for both free cash flow and revenue and said it was seeing growing demand for its AI products. The company has also cut jobs and expects to pause hiring for roles that could be replaced with AI, which is seen as a potential tailwind for margins.\n\nThe stock\u2019s surge is a recent phenomenon, however; while Apple Inc. has lagged this year, its five-year total return of 275% is much stronger than IBM\u2019s 82% gain over the same period.\n\nWall Street remains divided, with bulls outnumbered by skeptics and bears, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. While it looks cheaper relative to most big-tech stocks, IBM\u2019s multiple of 19 times estimated earnings is near its highest in 20 years. Furthermore, the stock is 4% over the average price target, among the worst return potentials among components of the S&P 500 tech index.\n\nStory continues\n\nStill, the company offers something that is something of a rarity among big tech: a robust dividend. The indicated yield is 3.43%, well above others in the sector. The indicated yields for Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp. are below 1%, and while Nvidia pays a dividend, the yield is essentially non-existent.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t been enough to entice bulls in the face of IBM\u2019s growth potential, which is expected to remain far below the megacaps. Revenue is expected to grow at a single-digit pace for the next several years, compared with double-digit expansion for other AI-adjacent companies like Microsoft or Alphabet Inc. Its most recent report failed to juice expectations; while the consensus for the company\u2019s net 2024 earnings is up 4.4% over the past quarter, the view for revenue has barely budged, per data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\n\u201cThe CEO has done a heroic job in starting to turn the company around, but it is just generally slower growth, and not cheap enough to be enticing relative to those more modest prospects,\u201d said David Katz, chief investment officer at Matrix Asset Advisors. \u201cWe can easily do better elsewhere.\u201d\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nIn a measure of how tech continues to be driven by its biggest companies, an index of small-cap tech stocks is down 7% this year, making it a dramatic underperformer compared with other size categories. The S&P 500 tech sector index, which tracks large-cap tech stocks, is up 12% in 2024. However, an index of mid-cap tech has done best of all, with a gain of 14%.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nThe Biden administration is considering blacklisting a number of Chinese semiconductor firms linked to Huawei Technologies Co. after the telecom giant notched a significant technological breakthrough last year, people familiar with the matter said. The US will award Intel Corp. $8.5 billion in grants and as much as $11 billion in loans to help fund an expansion of its semiconductor factories, the Commerce Department announced Wednesday, marking the largest award from a program designed to reinvigorate the domestic chip industry. Tencent Holdings Ltd. plans to more than double its stock buyback program to at least $12.8 billion in 2024, mollifying investors concerned about a gradual dissipation of growth during a Chinese economic downturn. Samsung Electronics Co. gained its most in more than six months after Nikkei Asia reported Nvidia Corp. is looking to buy its high-bandwidth memory chips, marking a milestone for Korea\u2019s largest company.

To skip our detailed analysis, go directly to the 5 NASDAQ Stocks with Biggest Upside.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite was the worst performer among the major market indices in 2022 and made a stellar comeback in 2023. The index was down 33% at the end of 2022 and recovered from its abysmal performance with a 43% gain in 2023. To put things in perspective, the Nasdaq Composite index hit its previous record in November 2021 with a little over 16,000 points, and it was still a thousand points behind it by the end of 2023, even after the outstanding performance during the year. However, the index has hit new highs and is at 16,275 at March 1 market close. The Nasdaq-100, which includes the 100 largest and most actively traded non-financial companies in the world, recorded its fourth-best performance since 1986, with a 53.81% gain in 2023.\n\nNasdaq\u2019s performance is attributed to the fact that it is mostly concentrated in tech stocks, which were the best performers of the year in 2023. The Magnificent 7 stocks remained in the limelight as several of the top performers of the index were a part of the group, which include NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and they gained 239% and 194% in 2023, respectively. However, some other stocks made significant strides through the year as well. Some of them are Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW), and Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI). Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) gained nearly 128%, and Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) was 110% higher by the end of 2023. Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) performed even more spectacularly in 2023 and is still on a remarkable upward trajectory in the current year. As of March 18, the stock has gained more than 900% over the past 12 months.\n\nAlthough 5 of the magnificent 7 stocks are still performing well and their price charts are still in green on a year-to-date basis, as of March 18, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) have declined significantly. Apple is down 4.61%, and Tesla has also fallen out of favor among many analysts and is down 32% year-to-date. However, Cathie Wood of Ark Invest still sees long-term growth for Tesla, Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock due to its autonomous driving software. Last year, Wood said in an interview on CNBC that she believes that the company\u2019s stock price will hit the $2000 mark by 2027. In 2024, the investor is still bullish on the stock. Ark Invest bought $141 million worth of Tesla, Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock in January, as reported by Bloomberg on January 29. The firm also bought over $35 million worth of company shares on March 14, as reported by Business Insider on the same day.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs There a Stop to the AI Rally?\n\nInvestors and analysts keep mixed reviews about the rising AI trend. While some believe that the AI surge could be a bubble and that tech stocks are now overvalued, others hold the opinion that AI is a revolutionary trend that will dominate the market for years to come. Looking at recent earnings of the tech stocks, the latter scenario is more likely.\n\nThe industry leader, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), reported its Q4 earnings on February 21. It reported non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) of $5.16, which was up 28% sequentially, and was 486% higher than last year. Furthermore, its revenue increased by 265% year-over-year (YoY) to $22.1 billion. The company's gross margin also increased by 10.6%, year over year, to 76.7% in the quarter. On March 18, Truist and HSBC raised NVIDIA\u2019s price target by $266 and $170, respectively. Truist has a price target of $1,177 for the stock, while HSBC\u2019s Frank Lee raised NVIDIA Corporation\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) price target to $1050. The stock is currently trading at around $885, as of March 18.\n\nAfter NVIDIA Corporation\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) first-rate earnings report, Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) also showed strength in its earnings in the fourth quarter due to a high demand for its artificial intelligence servers. The company reported an EPS of $2.20 and a revenue of $22.32 billion, which outperformed the market estimates by $0.48 and $150 million, respectively. The stock gained 31.5% in a day on March 1 and is up nearly 13% month-to-date as of March 18. Dell Technologies\u2019 (NYSE:DELL) also increased its quarterly dividend by 20%. The company\u2019s earnings revived investor belief in AI, and most of the industry-related stocks moved higher during the day. At Dell Technologies\u2019 (NYSE:DELL) Q4 2024 earnings call, COO and Vice Chairman of the company, Jeffrey Clark, highlighted the demand growth for AI-optimized servers. He said:\n\n\u201cAI-optimized server orders increased by nearly 40% sequentially. We shipped $800 million of AI-optimized servers, and our backlog nearly doubled sequentially, exiting the fiscal year at $2.9 billion. Demand continues to outpace GPU supply, though we are seeing H100 lead times improving. We are also seeing strong interest in orders for AI-optimized servers equipped with the next generation of AI GPUs, including the H200 and the MI300X. Most customers are still in the early stages of their AI journey, and they are very interested in what we are doing at Dell. We are helping them get started and work through their use cases, data preparation, training, and infrastructure requirements.\u201d\n\nNow let us continue to our list of NASDAQ stocks with the biggest upside potential, which includes Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc. (NASDAQ:RARE), Viasat, Inc. (NASDAQ:VSAT), and Sunrun Inc. (NASDAQ:RUN).

Next, we checked each stock\u2019s analyst ratings and price targets on TipRanks. We then chose the 10 stocks with the highest average analyst price target upside at the time of writing on March 18 and listed the stocks in ascending order.\n\nWe also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment around each stock. The hedge fund data was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 933 elite hedge funds as of Q4, 2023. Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That\u2019s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n10 NASDAQ Stocks with Biggest Upside\n\n10. Baker Hughes Company (NASDAQ:BKR)\n\nAverage Analyst Price Target Upside: 22.99%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 47\n\nBaker Hughes Company (NASDAQ:BKR) is a Texas-based company that offers energy and industrial solutions. According to TipRanks, the stock has a consensus rating of Strong Buy as per the 14 Wall Street analysts that covered it over the past three months. The average price target of $39.85 implies an upside of 22.99% from the current levels at the time of writing on March 18.\n\nOn February 21, Baker Hughes Company (NASDAQ:BKR) announced that it won a significant and multi-year award for the provision of integrated well construction services for rigs in the Buzios pre-salt field offshore Brazil. The work on the three rigs is expected to begin in the first half of 2025.\n\nBaker Hughes Company (NASDAQ:BKR) was part of 47 hedge funds\u2019 portfolios in the fourth quarter of 2023 with a total stake value of $911.825 million. AQR Capital Management is the most prominent shareholder in the company and has a position worth nearly $137.851 million, as of Q4, 2023.\n\nBaker Hughes Company (NASDAQ:BKR) is one of the top NASDAQ stocks with the biggest upside, along with Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc. (NASDAQ:RARE), Viasat, Inc. (NASDAQ:VSAT), and Sunrun Inc. (NASDAQ:RUN).\n\nClearBridge Investments made the following comment about Baker Hughes Company (NASDAQ:BKR) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cPerformance was boosted in the quarter by the Strategy\u2019s more economically-sensitive holdings among steady compounders and evolving opportunities. Oilfield equipment and services provider Baker Hughes Company (NASDAQ:BKR), meanwhile, benefited from a $20 rise in crude oil prices as well as disciplined execution.\u201d\n\n9. Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD)\n\nAverage Analyst Price Target Upside: 44.79%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 50\n\nInsulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD) is engaged in developing, manufacturing, and distributing insulin management systems for diabetic patients. In the fourth quarter of 2023, 50 hedge funds had stakes in Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD) with total positions worth $1.197 billion. This is compared to 44 funds with positions worth $938.370 million in the preceding quarter. As of December 31, 2023, Citadel Investment Group is the largest shareholder in the company with a stake worth $288.885 million.\n\nOn February 7, Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD) announced that its Omnipod 5 automated insulin delivery system with Abbott Laboratories\u2019 (NYSE:ABT) FreeStyle Libre 2 Plus sensor received CE Mark approval.\n\nIn the past three months, 12 Wall Street analysts have covered Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD), and 9 maintain a Buy rating on the stock. At the time of writing on March 18, the average price target of $238.33 has an upside of 44.79% from present levels.\n\nClearBridge Investments mentioned Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD) in its third quarter 2023 investor letter. Here is what it said:\n\n\u201cResults were primarily impacted by weakness among two health care holdings, Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD) and Surgery Partners. Positive clinical studies for GLP-1 therapeutics showed substantial health benefits to diabetic and obese patients, boosting stock prices of pharmaceutical companies tied to the manufacturing of these drugs. The potential for improved patient outcomes raised the risk of lower utilization for Insulet, a maker of insulin patch pumps, and Surgery Partners, whose outpatient surgery centers conduct weight loss and many other types of outpatient procedures. Though the GLP-1 threat is weighing on the valuation multiple of Insulet, any negative effects would likely not meaningfully affect the business for many years, especially given how large and underpenetrated the Type 2 diabetes market is for the company currently. Additionally, this could require significant improvements in cost, availability, and adherence for GLP-1s. Furthermore, we are encouraged that the majority of Insulet\u2019s business today is still from Type 1 diabetes, where fundamentals remain strong and the company is gaining share.\u201d\n\n8.

This has resulted in a higher level of resizing positions in the portfolio and exiting some long-term holdings this year. A good example in the portfolio today is Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD), a company that we bought too early but that remains a holding in the portfolio. Our average price for the initial WBD investment in 2021 was $26.48, or a P/V ratio in the mid-60s%. However, P/EV on the initial report was 79%. Under the new rules, we would not pay that price for the company today. We most likely would have waited for a mid-60s% P/EV, which would have equated to a $mid-teens entry price. In this case, we would have missed a too-large initial downturn in the stock price. The overweight rule dictated that we trimmed the position after the price ran up in the first half of 2023, which benefitted overall performance as the stock price subsequently fell again. However, even with the new rule lens, we remain confident in our case for the business and management\u2019s ability to deliver going forward.\u201d\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 NASDAQ Stocks with Biggest Upside.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n17 Worst Bachelor\u2019s Degrees for Student Loan Debt 13 Best EV Stocks To Buy in 2024 13 Best NASDAQ Penny Stocks To Invest In\n\nDisclosure.

Indeed, a potential Apple-Google Gemini partnership in artificial intelligence (AI) could mirror their deal with search, which was the subject of considerable regulatory scrutiny in recent years.\n\nAnd while a Google-Apple AI partnership is sure to draw the ire of antitrust regulators, I see the move as a potentially massive win for both companies as they seek to gain (further) in the AI race.\n\nWith Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) leading the charge on generative AI with its OpenAI stake, Apple must find a way to make up for lost time on the AI front. Teaming up with Google is a way to catch up with industry leaders like Microsoft. Also, it may be a straightforward way to pull ahead as Apple gains access to one of the most potent large language models (LLMs), Google Gemini. Given this, I remain bullish on both AAPL and GOOGL.\n\nApple: Teaming Up with an AI Powerhouse Could Prove Wise\n\nWhile I\u2019m sure Apple could incorporate its own LLM into its devices, I think Google is the better option at this early phase in the AI boom. Why? As good as LLMs have become in recent quarters, they\u2019re still not immune from hallucinating (making stuff up, seemingly out of the blue).\n\nOnly time will tell when we have a robust, hallucination-free LLM ready for the market. Regardless, given Apple\u2019s history of releasing polished products that are truly ready for takeoff, I just don\u2019t see Apple putting itself out there with a work-in-progress type of LLM product.\n\nAs capable and impressive as they are, even the latest versions of Google Gemini and ChatGPT-4 Turbo are technically works in progress, at least in my opinion.\n\nNeither LLM is perfect, especially at this point in the AI lifecycle, when hallucinations still happen regularly. My guess is it could take a while before LLMs are polished enough that mistakes become incredibly rare (or maybe virtually impossible).\n\nStory continues\n\nPerhaps we may be a few quarters or even a few years away from the error-free AI that many of us envision as a sort of holy grail in AI. Given how fast generative AI technologies are advancing (think exponential, not linear, rates), though, maybe hallucination-free LLMs are a heck of a lot closer than many of us may think.\n\nFor now, I think the masses have come to accept that the occasional hiccup is bound to happen when using even the best LLM that exists today. Users of such LLMs can simply check the sources themselves to ensure they\u2019re not on the receiving end of a hallucination. Indeed, fact-checking can be a bit of a hassle when using LLMs like Gemini or GPT-4, but it\u2019s a relatively small compromise. Further, it\u2019s between that and using an old-fashioned search engine.\n\nWhat Could the Future Hold for the Google-Apple AI Partnership?\n\nI don\u2019t think Apple has anything to really gain by rushing an LLM product to market right now, especially given that today\u2019s LLMs are prone to errors, negative headlines, lawsuits, public outrage, and all sorts of negativity.\n\nWhen the perfect time comes (perhaps when LLMs have a bit more polish), though, I think Apple could have the option to replace Google Gemini with its own LLM, just like when it gave Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) the boot from Mac devices when it was ready to launch on the back of its very own Apple Silicon.\n\nIn these early stages of the AI boom, Apple stands to benefit from all the positives of AI by using Gemini without having to deal with the downsides. If something goes awry, it\u2019s the Gemini LLM, not Apple, that\u2019s to blame. In the meantime, look for Alphabet to gain traction as Gemini introduces itself to Apple\u2019s golden install base, which is billions of users strong.\n\nIndeed, Gemini in iPhone could ultimately help Google and Apple surpass Microsoft in the LLM race. It will be interesting to see how a potential Google-Apple partnership evolves. Nevertheless, if any deal is inked, I expect that GOOGL stock could face a considerable valuation multiple expansion, perhaps one closer to that of its top AI peer, MSFT stock, even if Alphabet is forced to pay Apple a hefty sum.\n\nEven after surging 4.6% in a day, GOOGL stock still seems to have room to run at just 25.4 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) if it\u2019s to catch up to MSFT stock\u2019s 37.7 times trailing P/E multiple.\n\nIs GOOGL Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nAlphabet stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 28 Buys and eight Holds assigned in the past three months. The\u00a0average Alphabet stock price target of $165.09 implies 12.3% upside potential.\n\nIs AAPL Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nApple stock is a Moderate Buy, according to analysts, with 16 Buys, nine Holds, and one Sell assigned in the past three months. The\u00a0average Apple stock price target of $204.86 implies 16.3% upside potential.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIt seems like a Google-Apple Gemini AI deal would be a win for both firms in a bid to pull ahead in the generative AI race. It\u2019s important to note, however, that all we have is a report from Bloomberg about potential talks between the two companies.\n\nThe chatter about the chatter means that nothing is set in stone yet, even though recent market action suggests a dotted line has already been signed. In any case, look for Apple to go on the hunt for an AI partner as it seeks a \u201cbackstop\u201d in this still-early (and less-than-polished) stage of generative AI.\n\nDisclosure", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-google-gemini-partnership-could-014602633.html", "symbols": ["0QYP.IL", "0R2V.IL", "0RIH.IL", "AAPL.BA", "AAPL.MX", "AAPL.NEO", "AAPL.SN", "AAPL.US", "AAPL34.SA", "ABE0.F", "ABEA.F", "ABEA.XETRA", "ABEC.F", "ABEC.STU", "ABEC.XETRA", "APC.BE", "APC.DU", "APC.F", "APC.HA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.996, "neg": 0.034, "neu": 0.866, "pos": 0.1}}, {"date": "2024-03-20T00:00:00+00:00", "title": "3 Stocks That Could Benefit From the Rise of the Metaverse", "content": "Metaverse stocks alert: Unity's bold moves, Roblox's user engagement and Apple's innovative strategies present unique investment picks.", "link": "https://investorplace.com/2024/03/3-stocks-that-could-benefit-from-the-rise-of-the-metaverse/", "symbols": ["AAPL.US", "RBLX.US", "U.US"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.866, "neg": 0, "neu": 0.549, "pos": 0.451}}, {"date": "2024-03-19T23:24:00+00:00", "title": "Apple Looks to External Partners to Boost AI Efforts", "content": "Apple is looking to outside companies to help its artificial intelligence efforts.

The remaining claims were dismissed in a separate order.\n\n\u201cApple may ultimately be right that California law did not require it to do more to diminish the ability of stalkers to use AirTags effectively, but that determination cannot be made at this early stage,\" Chhabria wrote.\n\nChhabria detailed arguments from both Apple and the plaintiffs in the ruling. Included were accounts from the three remaining claims of victims being stalked by former partners or others through AirTags that were allegedly attached to their cars, resulting in emotional and sometimes financial harm.\n\nAll three of these cases involve \u201cpurported defects\u201d of AirTags that made it harder for the victims to both understand the tracking and quickly stop it, Friday's ruling outlines, including unclear or delayed notifications, as well as an inability to disable the devices remotely, which allegedly prolonged stalking.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re grateful for the opportunity to continue this critical litigation,\u201d Gillian L. Wade, an attorney representing the plaintiffs, told The Associated Press via email. \u201cAbusive and dangerous location tracking is only becoming more common, so it\u2019s imperative to do everything we can to give voice to the victims, and to push for accountability and change.\u201d\n\nApple and attorneys representing the California-based company did not immediately respond to requests for comment Tuesday.\n\nBack in February 2022, months ahead of the class action filing, Apple released a statement that said it \u201ccondemn(s) in the strongest possible terms any malicious use of our products.\" It also noted then-planned updates aimed at increasing safety.\n\nLast year, Apple also partnered with Google to submit a proposal aimed at setting standards for combatting secret surveillance on AirTags and similar gadgets.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/judge-denies-apples-attempt-dismiss-183435295.html", "symbols": ["0R2V.IL", "AAPL.BA", "AAPL.MX", "AAPL.NEO", "AAPL.SN", "AAPL.US", "AAPL34.SA", "APC.BE", "APC.DU", "APC.F", "APC.HA", "APC.HM", "APC.MU", "APC.STU", "APC.XETRA", "APC8.F"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": -0.538, "neg": 0.098, "neu": 0.811, "pos": 0.09}}, {"date": "2024-03-19T17:59:44+00:00", "title": "I was there for the dot-com bust. Here's why the AI boom isn't the same.", "content": "The booming prices of artificial intelligence stocks have some obvious parallels with the dot-com bubble that inflated the stock market to outrageous highs in 1999 and 2000. Parallels that make some investors nervous today.\n\nAccording to a recent survey from Bank of America, 40% of fund managers think AI stocks are in a bubble (45% say no, and 15% don't know).\n\nBut as someone for whom the dot-com bubble was current events rather than history, I can tell you that today\u2019s market isn\u2019t remotely like the dot-com bubble market was.\n\nHow can I say such a thing?\n\nIt\u2019s because the investing world has changed fundamentally from what it was in the dot-com bubble days.\n\nBack then, besotted people (I wouldn\u2019t call them investors) paid whatever the market was asking for ridiculously priced stocks like Pets.com, Boo.com, and Webvan, which ultimately croaked and left shareholders with nothing.\n\nWhy were people loading up with individual stocks? The fear of missing out on the internet wave certainly kept people piling money onto the table as they looked to quintuple their money. But the main reason was that back in 2000, people simply didn\u2019t invest like they do now, as broad-based index funds were pretty much nonexistent compared to today.\n\nSo people who had bought into the dot-com hype \u2014 and there were plenty of them \u2014 mostly bought individual stocks.\n\nThese days, people talk \u2014 mistakenly, in my opinion \u2014 about the S&P 500 (^GSPC) being in a bubble, given the concentration of a handful of stocks powering the index. Back then, the Nasdaq market was the hot thing. And boy, did that bubble burst. Pets.com, the leading online pet retailer, announced Nov. 7, 2000, that it was closing down and laying off more than 250 of its 320 employees after being unable to find a purchaser or a financial backer for the company. (Newsmakers) (Getty Images via Getty Images)\n\nOne of the most bubbly events took place on Jan. 10, 2000. That\u2019s when Gerald Levin had Time Warner, the media and entertainment company that he was running, do the dumbest deal in history: selling itself to America Online in return for AOL stock, which was a dot-com megabubble.\n\n(You may have read about this deal lately because Levin died last week and many obituaries mentioned his AOL debacle.)\n\nStory continues\n\nTwo months after the Time Warner-AOL deal was announced \u2014 on Mar. 10, 2000 \u2014 the Nasdaq, which had more than doubled from a year earlier, hit its closing peak of 5,048.62.\n\nThen the slide began. And kept on going. And going. And going.\n\nUltimately, the Nasdaq bottomed out at 1,114.11 on Oct. 9, 2002. That was 78% below its high. It didn\u2019t score another new high until April 23, 2015 \u2014 more than 15 years after the previous peak.\n\nEven one of the high-quality companies that survived the bubble \u2014 Cisco Systems \u2014 hasn\u2019t been a great investment. It was recently trading for about 30% less than it fetched on Peak Bubble Day.\n\nBarring a totally unforeseen catastrophe, can you see the S&P losing 78% of its value in a little over two and a half years from now? I sure can\u2019t see that happening. Especially given the trillions of dollars currently sloshing around in S&P index funds, with more money flowing in on a regular basis from employers and employees participating in benefit plans and from institutional investors such as pension funds for whom the S&P is a benchmark.\n\nBut, you say, what about the Magnificent Seven tech companies whose stocks more than doubled last year and drove the S&P to new high after new high?\n\nThe S&P\u2019s total return \u2014 price increases plus reinvested dividends \u2014 for the year was 26.3%. Doesn\u2019t this mean that we\u2019re in a bubble?\n\nI don\u2019t think so. Among the reasons is that even though the Seven were incredibly hot, the other S&P companies \u2014 let\u2019s call them the Non-Magnificent 493 \u2014 had a total return of 9.9%, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. That\u2019s about the average return the US market has shown over the long term. The Pets.com sock puppet dog stars in a commercial for the company in Los Angeles, Jan. 11, 2000. (Bob Riha/Liaison/Getty Images) (Bob Riha Jr. via Getty Images)\n\nAmazingly, this year\u2019s market, despite a recent decline, is on track to outperform last year\u2019s market. The S&P had returned 7.28% through Friday\u2019s close, according to Silverblatt. Extrapolate that 2.5-month return to a full year and you get 34.9%.\n\nAnd now, some of last year\u2019s Magnificent Seven are having a less-than-magnificent 2024. Tesla (TSLA) was down 34.2% as of Friday\u2019s close \u2014 the worst performer in the S&P, according to Silverblatt.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) accounted for 32% of the S&P\u2019s gain this year, he says, with Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), and Amazon (AMZN) accounting for another 28%. Apple (AAPL), however, is down for the year, and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) has only a marginal gain. (So perhaps we should rename the Magnificent Seven the Fab Four?)\n\nThe point here is that it doesn\u2019t seem very bubbly when three of the Magnificent Seven aren\u2019t doing well and yet the S&P keeps chugging along.\n\nLook. I\u2019m not telling you that the market is any sort of bargain these days \u2014 it\u2019s not cheap by any standard. And I\u2019m not telling you that it\u2019s not going to decline, possibly sharply, over the mid- to long-term.\n\nBut what I am telling you is that there\u2019s a big difference between a high-priced market like today\u2019s and an insanely priced market like the Nasdaq was in the dot-com bubble days.\n\nThere may be some difficult times ahead for investors. But a decline of almost 80% over the next two and a half years?

The company\u2019s weak performance this year may be concerning, as revenue continues to decline despite still sky-high revenues. As analysis shows, it is noted that the price targets go from $158.00 to $250.00 with a $201.41 mean.\n\nHowever, light appears on the horizon for long-term investors. Recently, AAPL surged higher after the company reportedly bought Canadian AI startup DarwinAI. This deal highlights the company\u2019s focus on this space, and that its AI initiatives are beginning to roll. In early 2024, Apple integrated the DarwinAI team, with Apple\u2019s CEO hinting at future advancements in AI. This happened despite the company trailing behind rivals like Microsoft and Google.\n\nFurther, Apple dropped plans for electric cars and turned its attention toward generative AI, teasing a big AI reveal.

Also, they anticipate 2025 sales to cross $178 billion.

These large, competitively advantaged tech platforms have vastly outperformed the market over the past decade, and they also seem like great bets to benefit from the artificial intelligence revolution, too.\n\nBut their strong recent run has led many to believe these stocks are either overpriced or fairly priced relative to the rest of the market. On the other hand, many have been saying that for years, only to see these tech giants surpass earnings expectations.\n\nHow to balance their relatively high market valuations with their above-average growth prospects? One valuation metric touted by one of the most famous mutual fund managers of all time may hold the secret.\n\nThe PEG ratio\n\nThe PEG ratio, or price-to-earnings-to-growth metric, was first developed in 1969 by Mario Farina and later popularized by Peter Lynch, portfolio manager for the Fidelity Magellan Fund in the 1980s.\n\nTo calculate the PEG ratio, an investor should divide a company's P/E ratio by its expected earnings growth rate. In general, stocks may have a PEG ratio between 1 and 2, with stocks with PEGs under 1 considered undervalued, and stocks above 2 considered overvalued.\n\nA PEG ratio is an imperfect measure, to be sure, as some investors may use either the trailing or forward P/E ratio, and others use different lengths of time to calculate the long-term earnings growth numbers.\n\nOne standard type of PEG ratio is to look at the P/E ratio based on current year expected earnings, and the outlook for the next five years' earnings growth.\n\nMagnificent PEG Ratios\n\nHere's how the PEG ratios the Magnificent Seven stocks shake out.\n\nCompany PEG Ratio Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) 1.10 Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) 1.36 Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) 1.49 Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) 1.93 Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) 2.11 Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) 2.12 Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) 2.36\n\nData source: Yahoo! Finance.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere are a few expected results here, but also a few surprises. First, it's not surprising to see both Meta and Alphabet among the cheapest of these stocks. These two generally trade at discounts to other \"disruptive\" tech names, perhaps because of their already being large, \"mature\" companies. Moreover, many investors give less credit to revenue and profits that come from advertising, as ad revenue is thought to be economically sensitive and perhaps flighty.\n\nStill, that has been the case for years, and both Alphabet and Meta have generally been able to defy skeptics and continue solid growth over the long term as ad dollars continue to flow to digital ads from traditional advertisements.\n\nIn addition, Alphabet has lots of cash on its balance sheet and generates significant losses from its \"Other Bets\" segment, increasing its P/E ratio relative to its core business and making it look more expensive. And since it's really hard to know whether some of Alphabet's moonshot projects will pay off, analysts probably aren't forecasting any contribution from these loss-making but forward-thinking businesses, perhaps underrating Alphabet's earnings growth prospects even further.\n\nAnd of course, besides a reasonable valuation, Meta's new dividend is a good sign of confidence management has in the sustainability of its earnings. Thus, both of these stocks may be worth looking at if contemplating allocating to Magnificent Seven stocks today.\n\nOne big surprise here is Nvidia, which actually comes out as the second cheapest stock based on this measure. That's despite having the highest trailing P/E ratio at 73.5. That is, of course, because analysts are forecasting robust growth for Nvidia based on its lead in GPUs that currently dominate the artificial intelligence market. From the looks of it, it appears analysts believe that advantage will continue, and that the AI revolution will deliver sustainable high growth for Nvidia over the immediate term. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAre the bottom four worth considering?\n\nTesla, Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon are all near 2 or above in terms of their PEG ratios, making them generally unattractive on this metric.\n\nHowever, that doesn't necessarily mean one should avoid these stocks. Remember, the PEG ratio is just one indication, based on future earnings growth that is somewhat unknowable.\n\nMoreover, each of these companies have slightly different reasons for their high PEG ratios. Both Microsoft and Apple are generally given high valuations, not necessarily because of growth, but rather because of the stability of their businesses and the confidence that earnings will generally remain intact for a long time. Apple obviously has among the best consumer franchises in the world with the iPhone, making it not only a tech stock but more of a consumer staple. And consumer staples stocks generally trade at higher valuations despite lower growth, because of their perceived \"safety\" in good economic environments and bad.\n\nMicrosoft is also regarded as a very safe stock, because of its dominance of not one but several high-profit businesses, including the Windows operating system, the Office enterprise software suite, and its Azure cloud computing platform. Add in its exclusive arrangement with OpenAI, and it's perhaps no wonder Microsoft is given a high valuation that may be deserved.\n\nOn the other hand, the high PEGs for Amazon and Tesla probably have to do with their high multiples today and the substantial uncertainty to their future earnings.\n\nAmazon has typically spent all or most of its profit on future innovation, so its bottom line is incredibly difficult to project, even if the company generally does well. It's likely that Wall Street analysts aren't projecting much profit inflection, as is the case for Alphabet's \"other bets,\" since Amazon hasn't really ever harvested profit in a significant way.\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla is a pioneer in the emerging electric vehicle market, which has high growth expectations over the long term. However, that market has slowed in recent months amid high interest rates, and Tesla's earnings are actually currently declining as it cuts prices.\n\nThe combination of high long-term growth expectations in the face of a likely earnings decline this year means Tesla is quite risky. In fact, I would personally own Amazon over Tesla, despite the slightly higher PEG, since I think Amazon is more likely to see profit inflect upward relative to current analyst expectations than Tesla.\n\nDon't just use the PEG\n\nThe PEG ratio can be useful in offering a very quick snapshot of a company's valuation relative to its growth. However, one factor the PEG ratio doesn't capture very well is a business' safety compared with other stocks. P/E ratios are a reflection of both growth expectations and risk, but risk is a very squishy and difficult concept to quantify.\n\nMoreover, the greatest stock gains usually come from businesses that wildly outperform expectations, so using a metric that merely reflects expectations is also a limiting factor. That's why the PEG ratio is best used for companies with stable earnings growth, and not a bottom line that may bounce around year to year such as Amazon or Tesla.\n\nOverall, the PEG ratio is just one shortcut for investors. But remember, a company's intrinsic value is always the present value of future cash flows. If you come across a company that looks cheap based on a PEG ratio, see if you can dig deeper and map out what you think cash flow can do over the next decade, as well as the probability that your projected scenario will unfold.\n\nWhile the PEG ratio is a useful shortcut, remember that it's more a starting point than a destination.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

So far this year, stockholders are saying 'no' to many of them.\n\nApple shareholders roundly rejected a collection of ethics- and employment-centered initiatives, turning down a labor-backed proposal from AFL-CIO Equity Index Fund (AFLCIX) that suggested the iPhone maker report how it uses AI technology in its business operations.\n\nOther failed initiatives pushed for Apple to report more detailed information on racial and gender pay gaps and the evenness of its application of human rights policies around the globe. The headquarter of Apple in Cupertino, Calif.

It would have required Apple to disclose potential risks from its omission of \"viewpoint\" and \"ideology\u201d discrimination in its employment policy.\n\nBig money managers that serve as the largest stockholders in big, publicly-traded companies are shying away from any proposals likely to be viewed as activism, according to Lindsey Stewart, Morningstar\u2019s director of investment stewardship research.\n\nThat includes proposals both for and against ESG- and DEI-type policies.\n\n\"Certainly asset managers have dialed down their enthusiasm to back these kinds of proposals over the last few years,\" Stewart said.\n\nThe apparent swing in favor of less disclosure may be an indication that shareholders are growing tired of trying to influence corporate behavior.\n\n\"It\u2019s still too early to tell,\" said Stewart, referring to whether this year will show a statistically significant shift.\n\nA new phase\n\nThere have been some other notable company victories so far in 2024.\n\nAt Tyson Foods, shareholders voted against a third-party audit to monitor its worker population while the meat producer faces claims its employment of minors violated US labor laws.\n\nAt Applied Materials, shareholders of the semiconductor materials manufacturer voted against proposals to report on quantitative median and adjusted pay gaps across race and gender.\n\nOne greenhouse gas emissions proposal has won shareholder approval so far this year, according to ISS-Corporate.

In 2020, the SEC expanded human capital disclosure rules to require that companies disclose risks and resources associated with their employee headcount.\n\nThe next year in 2021, the SEC made it easier for investors to get climate change and social issues on corporate voting ballots while Nasdaq made it mandatory for listed companies to disclose diversity.\n\nStarting in 2025, the SEC's new climate rules will require companies to reveal their carbon footprint in an effort to help investors evaluate how climate change may impact businesses\u2019 bottom line.\n\n\"Those regulations and standards are starting to hit,\" Stewart said, \"so I think [shareholders] are feeling less need to push quite so hard on them because there are actual requirements out there that are prompting companies to make those kinds of disclosures.\"\n\nNo matter the reason, overall support for ESG-focused resolutions is falling and will likely continue, according to a recent Morningstar analysis.\n\n\"I think we're entering a phase moving away from the investor activism side of things into a phase where there's written down regulations and standards,\" Stewart said.\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Following a challenging year in 2022, which saw all three major stock indexes plunge into respective bear markets, the ageless Dow Jones Industrial Average, benchmark S&P 500, and innovation-driven Nasdaq Composite have all launched to new all-time highs in 2024.\n\nThere isn't just one factor that can be pointed to as the fuel for Wall Street's epic rally. Rather, it's a confluence of factors that includes a strong U.S. economy, better-than-expected corporate earnings, the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) as a next-big-thing trend, and a historically robust level of share repurchase activity. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAlthough aggregate corporate share buybacks in 2023 fell from the record levels observed during the 2022 bear market, the $787.3 billion S&P 500 companies collectively spent on share repurchases on a trailing-12-month basis, as of Sept. 30, 2023, remains well above the historic average.\n\nThe reason public companies enact share repurchase programs is threefold:\n\nFor companies with steady or growing net income, a steady reduction in the number of outstanding shares can increase earnings per share (EPS) over time. In other words, it can make a company appear more fundamentally attractive to investors. When a public company retires shares of its common stock, the ownership stakes of existing/long-term shareholders can increase over time. This encourages investors to have a long-term mindset. It's a way for a company's board of directors to demonstrate faith in a company's long-term growth strategy.\n\nWhile more than 56% of S&P 500 companies repurchased at least $5 million worth of their own stock during the September-ended quarter, there are a few companies that are step above the rest when it comes to buybacks.\n\nSince 2013, the following three widely owned companies have collectively repurchased $1.07 trillion worth of their own stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple: $651 billion in share repurchases since 2013\n\nWhen it comes to share repurchases, it's fair to say that tech stock Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is in a class of its own. Since initiating a share buyback program in 2013, the company has bought back about $651 billion worth of its common stock.\n\nTo put this into context, there are only eight companies in the S&P 500, excluding Apple, with a market cap above $651 billion. Apple could have comfortably purchased 491 of the other 499 S&P 500 companies with the amount of money it's spent buying back its stock.\n\nThere are a couple of reasons Apple has an abundance of cash to repurchase its stock. To start with, it's a trusted brand with an exceptionally loyal following. A survey conducted by SellCell.com in March 2021 of more than 2,000 iPhone users found that nearly 92% had no intention of switching smartphone brands with their next purchase.\n\nInnovation is the other big reason Apple has been nothing short of a cash cow. Domestically, Apple's iPhone has accounted for 50% or more of smartphone market share since becoming 5G-capable in 2020.\n\nHowever, Apple's future rests with innovation beyond the physical realm. Specifically, CEO Tim Cook has been emphasizing a shift toward subscription services. A subscription-driven operating model should steadily lift the company's operating margin, help smooth out some of the revenue lumpiness associated with physical product upgrade cycles, and can further enhance the benefits of the Apple product and service ecosystem.\n\nWhile reducing its outstanding share count by 41% since 2013 has provided a lift to Apple's EPS, investors should remain diligent about digging beneath the surface when analyzing the company's growth trends. For instance, even though Apple's adjusted EPS ticked higher by $0.02 per share in fiscal 2023 (ended in September), the company's net income fell by $2.8 billion to $97 billion for the year.\n\nFor the moment, Apple's buybacks are helping to partially mask a stalling of its growth engine. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAlphabet: $240 billion in share repurchases since 2015\n\nAnother S&P 500 component that's turned on the proverbial jets in the buyback department in recent years is Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), the parent of internet search engine Google, social media site YouTube, and autonomous driving company Waymo, among other ventures.\n\nSince initiating a share repurchase program in 2015, Alphabet's stock buybacks have grown with each passing year. The $61.5 billion spent repurchasing its stock in 2023 increased its aggregate buybacks over roughly eight years to $240 billion. Alphabet has spent enough on buybacks that it could have purchased all but 28 companies within the S&P 500, not counting itself.\n\nIf you're wondering what's made Alphabet such a success for so long, look no further than its virtual monopoly, Google. Data from GlobalStats shows that Google has accounted for at least a 90% monthly share of global internet search dating back almost nine years. It's the obvious go-to for businesses wanting to target their message(s) to users. As a result, Google tends to enjoy premium ad-pricing power in most economic climates.\n\nHowever, the lion's share of Alphabet's cash flow growth moving forward may well come from Google Cloud. As of the September-ended quarter, Google Cloud was the world's No. 3 cloud infrastructure service provider, with an estimated 10% share of enterprise cloud spending. More importantly, this segment generated a full-year profit in 2023 after many years of losses. Cloud services tend to produce considerably higher margins than advertising.\n\nAs Alphabet's outstanding share count continues to shrink, the company's sales and net income are climbing. This is a recipe for EPS growth to outpace sales growth for the foreseeable future.\n\nMicrosoft: $183 billion in share repurchases since 2013\n\nThe third juggernaut that's been putting the pedal to the medal in the buyback department for more than a decade is Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT). Though I've arbitrarily cut off the start date at 2013, Microsoft has been repurchasing its stock for even longer than Apple. Since 2013, it's collectively retired around $183 billion worth of its common stock.\n\nNot including itself, Microsoft has spent more on buybacks since the beginning of 2013 than the market caps of all but 41 S&P 500 companies.\n\nMicrosoft's continued outperformance is a function of it seamlessly blending its legacy operations with a handful of high-growth initiatives. For example, it's no secret that the growth heyday for Windows and Office have long since passed. Nevertheless, Windows still holds a 72% share of desktop operating systems worldwide. This is an exceptionally high-margin segment that generates abundant cash flow, which allows Microsoft to aggressively invest in higher-growth initiatives.\n\nWith regard to \"high-growth initiatives,\" I'm primarily talking about cloud services and AI. Cloud infrastructure service platform Azure is the world's No. 2 provider in terms of enterprise spending. Meanwhile, Microsoft has invested billions into OpenAI, the company behind popular chatbot ChatGPT, and recently unveiled its Maia AI chip to help power its own Azure data centers. The cloud and AI can help Microsoft sustain a double-digit sales growth rate.\n\nMicrosoft also has what might be the most pristine balance sheet on the planet. It's one of only two publicly traded companies to receive the highest possible credit rating (AAA) from Standard & Poor's. Microsoft closed out calendar year 2023 with $81 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, and it's generated nearly $103 billion in operating cash flow over the trailing-12-month period. This cash allows Microsoft to innovate, make acquisitions, buy back copious amounts of its own stock, and comfortably pay out the largest nominal-dollar dividend among publicly traded companies in the U.S.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

If you want to skip our discussion on dividend-paying companies, head over to 5 Best Dividend ETFs To Buy.\n\nReutersreported that global corporate dividends reached a record high of $1.66 trillion in 2023, largely due to substantial contributions from banks. According to the Janus Henderson Global Dividend Index, nearly 86% of listed companies worldwide either increased or maintained their dividends. Projections from the same index indicate that dividend payouts are set to hit a new peak of $1.72 trillion this year. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) emerged as the leading dividend payer in 2023, followed closely by Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM). The overall value of corporate dividends saw a 5% increase from 2022 to 2023, totaling $1.57 trillion. Ben Lofthouse, head of global equity income at Janus Henderson, attributed this growth to robust corporate cash flow, driving dividends and share buybacks.\n\nMoreover, high interest rates boosted bank margins, resulting in a record $220 billion payout to shareholders in 2023. However, this positive trend was counteracted by significant dividend cuts in the mining sector, primarily due to lower commodity prices. Although the rapid ascent of bank dividends may decelerate, declines in the mining sector are expected to have a reduced impact. Despite challenges in specific sectors, diverse industries such as vehicles, utilities, software, food, and engineering demonstrated promising growth. Geographically, Europe (excluding the UK) and Japan played pivotal roles in global dividend growth, with Europe witnessing a 10.4% increase in payouts. The United States, while making a substantial contribution to global dividend growth owing to its size, reported a growth rate in line with the global average at 5.1%. Conversely, emerging markets observed stagnant dividends, with Brazil facing substantial cuts and China experiencing lackluster growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Federal Reserve responded to the rise in inflation, spurred by monetary easing during the COVID-19 pandemic, by steadily increasing interest rates throughout 2023. This move had significant ramifications, leading to heightened borrowing costs for companies amid escalating interest rates and inflationary pressures. S&P Global Market Intelligencereported that there was a notable 59% increase in the number of companies filing for bankruptcy in 2023, compared to the previous year, nearing levels observed during the pandemic's peak. However, the anticipated growth in regular dividends in the US market averages around 5.8%, aligning with the 10-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.7% since 2014. The energy sector leads variable dividends, driven by a shift towards performance-based shareholder return policies since 2019. In 2022, over 20 energy companies disbursed a record $20 billion in variable dividends, benefiting from elevated oil and gas prices. However, in 2023, companies favored share repurchases due to lower valuation. The size of variable dividends in 2024 will hinge on oil and gas price volatility, demand, and its impact on share prices. The five largest sectors collectively contribute nearly 40% of total dividends and 2.05% in the estimated 5.8% growth, with real estate mandated to distribute the majority of its earnings.\n\nLately, investors are showing renewed interest in dividend-paying stocks this year after a period of decline in 2023, despite robust returns in the US stock market. Last year, rising interest rates led investors to favor bonds over stocks with smaller payouts, while mega-cap tech stocks attracted attention due to artificial intelligence hype. The S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats index saw a modest 5.7% increase compared to the broader S&P 500 total return index's 26% gain. However, with recent declines in yields and the possibility of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, dividend stocks are gaining traction again. Analysts suggest that investors are seeking stable, higher-yielding dividends amidst ongoing market volatility, particularly during an easing cycle. Companies that raise their dividends often receive favorable attention from investors, as evidenced by recent examples such as Lennar Corporation (NYSE:LEN) and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), whose stock prices increased following dividend hikes and share buyback announcements. Historical data indicates that companies increasing dividends tend to outperform in the stock market, while those lowering dividends may face underperformance.\n\nSome of the best dividend stocks to buy include Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), JPMorgan Chase & Co.

We would like to highlight one outstanding contributor for the year, electricity generator and marketer Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST), a low-cost provider with a healthy balance between generation and retail. Demand for electricity is growing and notably, load peaks are changing as well. As the country brings on more renewables and adjusts to greater demand later in the day due to increased use of electric heat pumps and electric car charging, reliable clean power is at a premium. Vistra is well positioned with diversified fuel sources including solar, natural gas, coal, nuclear and battery power storage facilities, along with a marketing division to manage price volatility. The company will soon be closing its accretive acquisition of merchant power generator, Energy Harbor, and the deal will make Vistra the second largest carbon free, nuclear electricity provider behind Constellation Energy, another portfolio holding.

They have also been an important voice to advocate for changes that will accelerate the global transition to a clean, renewable energy future, while maintaining adequate near-term supply. Vistra has a strong balance sheet that allows the company to invest in innovation and operational improvements. Additionally, management is using excess cash flow to buy 40% of the outstanding shares over a five year period and they are more than half way through that process.

As you can see from the chart below, Vistra\u2019s performance was quite different than many other electricity providers and provides further evidence of the disparate performance that can often be found within a sector.\u201d\n\n9.

Nvidia\u2019s Omniverse is a platform that allows programmers to create digital twins of objects and locations that they can use to determine how they\u2019ll behave or look in the real world.\n\nNvidia says organizations can use its Omniverse tool to create things like factories in a digital space so that they can understand how workers will move around the facility before they ever put shovels into the ground.\n\nDuring GTC, Nvidia showed how a designer could use a car configuration tool via the Vision Pro to manipulate different aspects of a vehicle and then virtually step into it.\n\nThe company says it\u2019s able to do this via its Omniverse Cloud APIs, or application programming interfaces, and its Graphics Delivery Network that streams directly to the Vision Pro via the cloud.

It ensures that Nvidia\u2019s Omniverse is available on Apple\u2019s high-end headset and gives Apple\u2019s Vision Pro another enterprise offering.\n\nApple's $3,499 Vision Pro is too pricy for most consumers, but enterprise customers, for the most part, can more easily swallow that kind of price. Plus, bringing Nvidia's Omniverse technology to the headset makes it a far more attractive purchase.\n\nWhether that means Apple will see a meaningful sales jump, however, remains to be seen. If it does, it could provide a powerful business line for the Vision Pro and Apple's bottom line.\n\nStory continues Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.

The group said this has helped the business save \u00a311m a year.\n\nBosses said the builders\u2019 merchant will continue to come under pressure from the weak market, as developers slow down their building work.\n\nNew chief executive Matt Pullen said:\n\n\u201cIn the short term, markets are expected to remain challenging, with continued weakness in the first half of the year followed by a progressive recovery in the second half as the macro-economic environment improves.\n\nThis recovery is however expected to be slower and more modest than previously anticipated.\n\nAs a result, it said sales for the full year are set to be \u201clower than expected\u201d and profits are now expected to remain roughly flat.

Meta still uses a nearby building on Brock Street.\n\nBritish Land has marketed the site as a science and innovation building \u201cin the heart of the Regent\u2019s Place campus within London\u2019s Knowledge Quarter\u201d, which is home to leading research institutions including The Francis Crick Institute, The Wellcome Trust, The Alan Turing Institute and University College London.\n\nChief executive Simon Carter said:\n\nWe proactively took 1 Triton Square back from Meta to reposition it for science and innovation customers, with the expectation of unlocking significantly higher rents, whilst benefitting from a considerable surrender premium to further improve the economics.\n\nThis transaction is another example of how we drive value through establishing innovative JV partnerships, enabling us to flex our balance sheet, share the risk and crystallise the value created from Meta\u2019s surrender premium.\n\nMark Evans of Royal London Asset Management Property added: \u201cWe have long recognised the demand for best-in-class science and innovation space, particularly in the Golden Triangle, and the need for this space in supporting the UK\u2019s economic growth. Meta paid a \u00a3149m fee to landlord British Land as part of its exit from 1 Triton Place\n\n07:22 AM GMT\n\nCurrys boosts profit outlook as it moves past bidding war\n\nCurrys said profits are on track to be slightly better than expected as a bidding war for the electricals retailer came to an end.\n\nBosses said adjusted profit before tax is expected to be at least \u00a3115m, having previously said it would come in between \u00a3105m to \u00a3115m.\n\nThe company remains on track to offload its Greece business in the first half of April, which will leave the company in a net cash position at the end of the financial year.\n\nIt comes after Chinese tech giant JD.com announced on Friday it would not make an offer for Currys, days after US investors Elliott Management said it would not submit a third bid to take the UK listed business private. Currys said its pre-tax profit would be at least \u00a3115m this year, having previously predicted \u00a3105m to \u00a3115m - Jason Alden/Bloomberg\n\n07:12 AM GMT\n\nRed Sea crisis \u2018causing 90-day shipping delays\u2019 for UK manufacturers\n\nBritish manufacturers are facing delays of as long as 90 days for shipments of parts caused by disruption in the Red Sea.\n\nMake UK, the manufacturing trade association, has warned of the enduring effect of attacks by Iran-backed Houthi rebels, who have been targeting commercial vessels travelling through the Red Sea in protest at Israeli military action in Gaza.\n\nMake UK said in its quarterly report:\n\nManufacturers are now reporting lead times increasing on average by two to three weeks, and even upwards of 90 days in some cases.\n\nThe challenge is that this creates bottlenecks across the supply chain as the delay of one component of even simple products can result in increasing lead times for goods.\n\nIt comes as the trade body warned the UK\u2019s manufacturing sector faces two years of \u201canaemic growth\u201d, with the sector forecasted to grow by just 0.1pc this year and 0.6pc next - half the rate of the broader economy in 2025.\n\n06:50 AM GMT\n\nHouse asking prices jump \u00a35,000 in a month\n\nAsking prices have jumped by more than \u00a35,000 so far this month as calm in the mortgage market fosters more confidence in property values.\n\nThe average price of a newly marketed house rose by 1.5pc to \u00a3368,118 in March, according to figures from Rightmove. That equates to a \u00a35,279 increase, which markets the biggest rise in 10 months.\n\nIn a further sign of recovery for the UK housing market, the number of sales being agreed has risen 13pc compared with this time last year.\n\nTim Bannister, director of property science at Rightmove, said: \u201cThe stronger than usual price growth this March indicates that new sellers are feeling much more confident, with some perhaps being over-optimistic, that there is enough buyer activity and affordability in their local market to achieve a higher price.\u201d\n\nLondon saw the biggest increase in demand for properties compared with this time last year, as slowing inflation, wage increases and a push back to offices among employers made the capital more appealing.\n\nMuch of the activity in the housing market has been driven by sales of properties to wealthy buyers for whom mortgage rates are less of an issue. So-called \u2018top-of-the-ladder\u2019 sales were up 18pc in March so far compared with last year, Rightmove said.\n\nDespite March\u2019s jump, average asking prices are still \u00a34,776 lower than their peak in May 2023.\n\nMr Bannister added:\n\nDespite the above-average price increases in this opening three months of the year, asking prices are still \u00a34,776 below their peak in May 2023.\n\nFor those who can afford to buy and have yet to take action to move this year, this may provide a window of opportunity to buy as we now seem to be past the bottom of the market.\n\nWhile some sellers are still being overoptimistic with their pricing expectations, there are also more sellers who are aware of the need to be negotiable and realistic, with elevated interest rates compared to recent years still stretching affordability for many buyers. Rightmove has released its latest figures on UK house asking prices - Yui Mok/PA Wire\n\n06:47 AM GMT\n\nGood morning\n\nThanks for joining us today. An improving mortgage market has given house sellers the confidence to demand an extra \u00a35,000 for their home on average this month compared to February.\n\nRightmove said the value of newly marketed house has risen by 1.5pc to \u00a3368,118.\n\n5 things to start your day\n\n1) Migration surge drives London population to new record | Concerns over housing intensify as capital surpasses pre-pandemic peak\n\n2) Hunt hits landlords with stealth capital gains tax raid | Previous reduction in tax-free allowance offsets gains from lowered rate\n\n3) ITV cuts jobs amid advertising slump | Broadcaster faces biggest slump in advertising since financial crisis\n\n4) British Airways to use robot baggage handlers at Gatwick | Driverless baggage tugs to be rolled out as industry battles staff shortages\n\n5) Why Britain\u2019s four-day week pioneer says he will never go back | Boss of UK challenger bank Atom believes office purists need to \u2018grow up\u2019\n\nWhat happened overnight\n\nAsian stocks advanced ahead of policy decisions this week by the Bank of England, Japan\u2019s central bank and the US Federal Reserve.\n\nChinese data for January-February were mixed, with property investment falling while other indicators showed improvement.\n\nIn Tokyo, shares closed sharply higher as investors await a decision by the Bank of Japan on Tuesday on whether to raise its benchmark interest rate for the first time in 17 years. Since 2016, the rate has remained at minus 0.1pc.\n\nThe benchmark Nikkei 225 index jumped 2.7pc, or 1,032.80 points, to 39,740.44, while the broader Topix index climbed 1.9pc, or 51.19 points, to end at 2,721.99.\n\nThe Hang Seng in Hong Kong was flat at 16,720.40, and the Shanghai Composite index gained 0.5pc to 3,069.67.\n\nElsewhere, Australia\u2019s S&P/ASX 200 was unchanged at 7,670.60, while the Kospi in South Korea advanced 0.6pc, to 2,681.26.\n\nIn India, the Sensex was unchanged and in Bangkok the SET was up 0.5pc.", "link": "https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/giving-oil-fantasy-says-saudi-185938914.html", "symbols": ["0Q1N.IL", "0R2V.IL", "0RIH.IL", "91D.F", "AAPL.BA", "AAPL.MX", "AAPL.NEO", "AAPL.SN", "AAPL.US", "AAPL34.SA", "ABE0.F", "ABEA.F", "ABEA.XETRA", "ABEC.F", "ABEC.STU", "ABEC.XETRA", "APC.BE", "APC.DU", "APC.F", "APC.HA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 1, "neg": 0.06, "neu": 0.841, "pos": 0.1}}, {"date": "2024-03-18T18:25:00+00:00", "title": "A Google Deal With Apple on AI Software Could Pose Antitrust Challenges", "content": "Google pays billions of dollars a year to be the default search engine on the iPhone and in the Safari internet browser.\n\nContinue reading", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/m/d654b9db-88e1-30c2-bf71-42adbc3be5d3/a-google-deal-with-apple-on.html", "symbols": ["0R2V.IL", "0RIH.IL", "AAPL.BA", "AAPL.MX", "AAPL.NEO", "AAPL.SN", "AAPL.US", "AAPL34.SA", "ABE0.F", "ABEA.F", "ABEA.XETRA", "ABEC.F", "ABEC.STU", "ABEC.XETRA", "APC.BE", "APC.DU", "APC.F", "APC.HA", "APC.HM", "APC.MU"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0, "neg": 0, "neu": 1, "pos": 0}}, {"date": "2024-03-18T16:51:04+00:00", "title": "The Mag 7 Is Soaring Again", "content": "After pulling back from recent highs, the Magnificent Seven collection of megacap technology stocks was rallying on Monday.

It's home to most large technology companies, and also the place where a slew of smaller stocks in other industries are traded.\n\nTech stocks have been the stock market's leaders last year and so far this year. Smaller stocks are starting to come alive.\n\nMost investors head to the Nasdaq for technology exposure. That's fine, but I wouldn't ignore the small fry in other industries. Here are seven Nasdaq stocks I like now.\n\nEast West\n\nEast West Bancorp Inc. (NASDAQ:EWBC), based in Pasadena, California, finances a lot of film and television projects. It's also one of the few U.S. banks licensed to do business in China.\n\nU.S.-China relations stink right now. And the major presidential candidates (Joe Biden and Donald Trump) aren't perceived as friendly to China. But neither was Richard Nixon, until he moved to open up a relationship with China in 1972.\n\nAny thaw in the U.S.-China relationship would be good for East West. Meanwhile, it is doing pretty well, having increased its earnings by more than 14% a year over the past 10 years.\n\nAgco\n\nSelling all kinds of agricultural equipment, from fertilizer to tractors, through a network of more than 3,000 dealers worldwide, Agco Corp. (NYSE:AGCO) has been profitable in each of the past 24 years.\n\nOver the past 10 years, it has increased its earnings at better than a 14% clip (coincidentally the same as East West). Its return on stockholders' equity lately has been running at 27%; I consider anything over 15% good. Yet the stock is cheap, selling for less than 8 times recent earnings.\n\nLegacy Housing\n\nBased in Bedford, Texas, Legacy Housing Corp. (NASDAQ:LEGH) makes manufactured homes and extra-small homes, serving the low end of the housing market.\n\nSince the U.S. has a shortage of single-family homes, and since paying for a home is a strain from many families, I think this company occupies a useful niche. The company has very little debt, and the stock sells for 9 times earnings.\n\nStory continues\n\nPreformed Line\n\nPreformed Line Products Co. (NASDAQ:PLPC), which calls Cleveland, Ohio home, makes equipment for power lines and phone lines. It also makes mounting systems for solar panels.\n\nOver the past decade, Preformed has increased its earnings at a 19% annual pace. Last year growth was slower, at 7%. The stock sells for about 10 times earnings.\n\nMasterCraft Boat\n\nI've had poor luck with holdings in the boating industry. Nonetheless, I think that MasterCraft Boat Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:MCFT) looks intriguing.\n\nThe company, out of Vonore, Tennessee, makes sport boats and outboard boats. The pandemic boosted boat sales because it's a form of recreation that is outdoors and doesn't involve crowds. Lately boat makers' sales have retreated, but if they level off, I like this stock at less than 7 times earnings.\n\nAlphabet\n\nWe don't want to neglect the big tech companies. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is one of the Magnificent Seven stocks that have chalked up big gains in Alphabet's case, 373% over the past 10 years.\n\nAlphabet is the parent to Google, You Tube, Waymo and Deep Mind. Innovation is built into its culture, and the company has increased its earnings by an average of more than 21% a year over the past decade.\n\nThe stock is much more expensive than those discussed above, but I don't think that 24 times earnings is too much to pay here.\n\nApple\n\nEven more expensive, at 27 times earnings, is Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), the maker of iPhones and Mac computers. Here there are worries, but also great strengths.\n\nEarnings growth, which averaged better than 16% over the past decade, slowed to 9% last year. The iPhone faces increased competition from Huawei in China. And the company's debt has climbed to 146% of equity.\n\nNonetheless, I still like Apple. It has a large and loyal following, and a history of successfully pulling rabbits out of hats in product development.\n\nTrack record\n\nEvery year in March, I write about my favorite stocks on the Nasdaq. Over 17 years, the average 12-month return on my recommendations has been 19.20%. The beats the average return on the Nasdaq Composite Index (16.30%) and the Standard & Poor's 500 Total Return Index (13%).\n\nBear in mind that my column results are hypothetical and shouldn't be confused with results I obtain for clients. Also, past performance doesn't predict the future.\n\nMy picks from a year ago climbed 23.80%, which beat the Nasdaq Composite (20.80%) but not the S&P 500 (31.60%). The best performer was Taylor Morrison Home Corp. (NYSE:TMHC), up 57%. The worst was Cirrus Logic Inc. (NASDAQ:CRUS), down 15%.\n\nJohn Dorfman is chairman of Dorfman Value Investments LLC in Boston, Massachusetts. He or his clients may own or trade securities discussed in this column.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) investors, with the company's share price down about 7% year to date, compared to the roughly 9% gain the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:SPY) has experienced during the same period.\n\nCommonly cited reasons for the disappointing start to the year have been fears of lower demand in China, potentially falling behind in the artificial intelligence (AI) race, regulatory pressures and low growth.\n\nJordan Klein, an analyst at Mizuho, sees another major risk on the horizon, warning that things could get worse for Apple.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nUS military-backed AI robotics company announces new equity raise for regular investors, here\u2019s how to buy shares and potentially own a stake.

(NASDAQ:STNE), Markel Group Inc. (NYSE:MKL), Globe Life Inc. (NYSE:GL), and D.R. Horton Inc. (NYSE:DHI) as well as significantly trimming its stakes in HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) and Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe D.R Horton stake in particular was built up as recently as the second quarter of last year.\n\nKlein sees the stock as likely to lag the market until the company shares more about its AI plans, which he speculates might come as soon as June at the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) developer event.\n\nDan Ives, a senior equity research analyst at Wedbush Securities, deems the situation a strong buying opportunity, giving Apple's stock a price target of $250 per share. He cites massive pent-up demand in the iPhone upgrade cycle and high expectations of \"AI finally coming to Cupertino (in California).\"\n\nFor long-term investors in Apple, it's paid to ignore short-term worries and stay the course. In the past five years, the stock has seen a more than 267% gain. Meanwhile, investors fortunate enough to have bought and held since its 1984 initial public offering (IPO) would be sitting on an over 142,000% gain.\n\nThe 13Fs are due within 45 days of a quarter ending, so investors waiting for the next updates on Berkshire\u2019s portfolio will likely need to wait until mid-May.\n\nRead More on Startup Investing:\n\nWealthTech startup unlocks a $33 trillion home equity market and you can own a stake in it with just $250.

(NYSE:SPOT) in its 2023 annual investor letter:\n\nSpotify Technology S.A. (NYSE:SPOT) is currently selling for about $15 billion. Does this make any sense?\u201d We argued that Spotify stock was extremely mis-priced by the market. That aged pretty well as the current market cap for Spotify is ~$40 billion. Spotify\u2019s stock skyrocketed +138% in 2023, strongly contributing to our outperformance. Spotify surpassed analyst expectations by adding 26% more monthly active users (MAUs) year-over-year in Q3 2023, reaching a total of 489 million (estimated to close the year with 600 million MAUs). This impressive growth solidified Spotify\u2019s position as the world\u2019s leading music streaming platform.

It seems Apple has considered using OpenAI\u2019s models for image generation and the like, but \u201cactive negotiations\u201d with Gemini proprietor Google are underway.\n\nOf course, Apple and Google have already had a close partnership for nearly two decades, around making Google the default search engine in Safari. That bond is now being frayed by pressure from antitrust regulators in the U.S. (where the Justice Department has sued Google for paying Apple and others billions of dollars to make it the search default) and in Europe (where the new Digital Markets Act has forced Apple to prompt iOS Safari users to choose which search engine they want as their default).\n\nAs Bloomberg notes, a new AI deal could \u201chelp make up for\u201d the falling value of Google and Apple\u2019s search agreement\u2014but it could also increase antitrust scrutiny for both companies. After all, the smartphone operating system market is essentially divided between the two companies, so having the same AI garnish on both Android and iOS could raise questions.\n\nWhat if Apple opts for OpenAI instead? Here, Microsoft enters into the equation. On the one hand, Microsoft\u2019s patronage of OpenAI is also under antitrust scrutiny in both the U.S. and Europe, so an OpenAI-Apple deal could be quite useful in demonstrating that Sam Altman\u2019s company is not effectively a Microsoft unit. But can you imagine if the deal were to extend to MacOS? Then the whole desktop operating system market would be powered by the same large language model.\n\nStory continues\n\nPerhaps a more durable solution would be for Apple to partner with an AI company like Anthropic or Mistral, where the potential antitrust pitfalls aren\u2019t quite so predictable. Or maybe Apple can get its act together on developing its own models into a competitive option.\n\nIncidentally, while on the subject, there\u2019s a new report out that says OpenAI\u2019s models have developed prejudices against speakers of African American English, \u201cexhibiting covert stereotypes that are more negative than any human stereotypes about African Americans ever experimentally recorded, although closest to the ones from before the civil rights movement\u2026 Language models are more likely to suggest that speakers of African American English be assigned less prestigious jobs, be convicted of crimes, and be sentenced to death.\u201d\n\nApple won\u2019t be using AI for such life-changing (or life-ending) decisions, but still, my advice would be to tread really carefully when deciding which models to use, and how to use them.

Over the longer term, QCOM stock could also get a considerable boost from Apple\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL) renewal of its modem deal with the chip maker.\n\nFinally, Qualcomm recently reported encouraging quarterly financial results, and the valuation of QCOM stock is relatively low.\n\nGiven all of these points, I believe that investors looking for a conservative, long-term play on AI should consider buying QCOM stock.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nA Good Play on Edge AI and the Increased Computerization of Autos\n\nAs I noted in a previous column, \u201cEdge AI devices are connected to the internet and have their own AI rather than relying on distant data centers and the cloud (for AI capabilities).\u201d And by using their own AI chips, these devices are able to process workload significantly more quickly and provide many more applications than systems that rely on cloud-based AI.\n\nAmong the apps enabled by devices with their own AI capabilities are \u201cfacial recognition and real-time traffic updates.\u201d Edge AI devices also can assist healthcare practitioners more effectively than systems that use datacenters\u2019 AI chips.\n\nIn October, QCOM stock introduced new AI chips for PCs and smartphones. Given the firm\u2019s decades of experience with providing cutting-edge chips for smartphones and PCs, I\u2019m confident that QCOM will benefit significantly from what I see as the coming proliferation of Edge AI.\n\nMeanwhile, in January, QCOM stock reported that it was developing hardware that would enable autos to exploit AI. Noting that its Snapdragon Digital Chassis, has been installed in over 350 million vehicles, the firm estimated that its \u201cautomotive-related revenue\u201d would reach $4 billion \u201cby 2026,\u201d Seeking Alpha reported.\n\nWith autos becoming increasingly more computerized and AI likely to become significantly more advanced over the medium term and the long term, I think that many automakers will look to incorporate a significant amount of the technology into their products in the coming years. The latter trend, in turn, should meaningfully lift Qualcomm and QCOM stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nHelp From Samsung and Apple Is on the Way\n\nIn a note to investors on March 11, investment bank Rosenblatt Securities reported that the deliveries of Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S24 had risen 13% compared with those of its predecessor, the S23, during the same period a year earlier. Moreover, the shipments of the Galaxy S24, which incorporate Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon 8 chip, were 47% above the rate at which the S22 was delivered two years ago, Rosenblatt stated.\n\nMeanwhile, after Apple reportedly had difficulty creating its own modem chips, Qualcomm reported at the end of January that the iPhone maker had agreed to buy Qualcomm\u2019s modem chips for another two years, through March 2027. The Street is likely still upbeat about the latter news.\n\nMoreover, I believe that ,given Apple\u2019s past struggles with building its own modem chips, we can expect to see the tech giant eventually further extend its contract with Qualcomm in this area.\n\nStrong Quarterly Results and an Attractive Valuation\n\nIn QCOM\u2019s fiscal Q1 which ended on Dec. 24, the firm\u2019s earnings per share jumped 24% versus the same period a year earlier to $2.46, while its top line rose 5% year-over-year to $9.9 billion.\n\nAlso noteworthy is that its smartphone revenue rose 16% YOY, while its automotive revenue soared 31% YOY to a record $598 million.\n\nIn terms of valuation, the stock\u2019s forward price-earnings ratio of 17.6 times is rather low and attractive, given its strong, positive catalysts.\n\nMoreover, the shares have a significant dividend yield of 1.9%.\n\nQualcomm\u2019s high current profitability, along with its well-established smartphone business and attractive valuation, make it a good AI play for conservative investors.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

This is a fact that's not lost on Wall Street's brightest and most successful institutional money managers.\n\nHowever, there was a discernible shift in sentiment among billionaire investors during the December-ended quarter concerning the top-performing Magnificent Seven component: Artificial intelligence (AI) leader Nvidia.\n\nSurprise! Billionaire money managers are selling AI stock Nvidia\n\nInvestors who've put their money to work in artificial intelligence stocks have been handsomely rewarded -- perhaps none more so than Nvidia's shareholders.\n\nIn a little over a year's time, Nvidia has established itself as the infrastructure foundation of the AI movement. The company's A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) account for the lion's share of GPUs currently in use in AI-accelerated data centers. In fact, many of the company's top customers are Magnificent Seven members, including Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet.\n\nStory continues\n\nOptimists fully expect Nvidia to keep its foot on the accelerator as it ramps production of its prized A100 and H100 GPUs. With supply chain issues easing -- including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing boosting its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate capacity -- Nvidia should be able to meet demand from more of its customers this year.\n\nHowever, the Nvidia growth story may not be as picture-perfect as its stock chart would suggest. Aside from well-established valuation concerns, Nvidia is set to face a flurry of operating headwinds. Perhaps that's what compelled eight billionaires to sell shares of Nvidia during the fourth quarter, including (total shares sold in parentheses):\n\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management (1,689,322 shares) Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International (1,170,611 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (1,088,821 shares) David Tepper of Appaloosa Management (235,000 shares) Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (218,839 shares) Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management (142,900 shares) John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments (30,663 shares)\n\nMost investors in AI stocks/Nvidia have probably heard all about incoming competition from the likes of Intel and Advanced Micro Devices. Both companies have GPUs they've launched or plan to launch this year that are specifically designed to compete with Nvidia in enterprise data centers.\n\nThe far bigger concern for Nvidia is that the aforementioned four Magnificent Seven members that account for 40% of its sales -- Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet -- are all developing AI chips of their own for use in their data centers. A significant percentage of Nvidia's sales may go away if these core customers shift to in-house AI chips. At best, Nvidia will see less in the way of purchases from these four juggernauts.\n\nAnother kick in the pants for Nvidia is that U.S. regulators are actively restricting exports of high-powered AI GPUs to the world's No. 2 economy, China. After the first round of restrictions, Nvidia developed toned-down versions of its powerhouse AI GPUs, the A800 and H800, for the Chinese market. However, the newest round of export restrictions affects these models, too.\n\nThere's also a strong likelihood that Nvidia will sap its own gross margin as it increases production of its top-selling GPUs. With data center sales growing many multiples faster than cost of revenue in fiscal 2024 (Nvidia's fiscal year ended on Jan. 28, 2024), it clearly shows that pricing power, not an increase in units sold, drove the company's sales higher. As GPU scarcity tapers, so will Nvidia's otherworldly pricing power.

Prominent billionaire money managers commonly sold Meta Platforms, Alphabet, and even Microsoft stock during the previous quarter.\n\nBut there was one exception to this selling: E-commerce and cloud-services frontrunner Amazon. All told, eight high-profile billionaires piled into this multi-industry leader, including (total shares purchased in parentheses):\n\nKen Griffin of Citadel Advisors (4,321,477 shares) Jim Simons of Renaissance Technologies (4,296,466 shares) Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management (947,440 shares) Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management (888,369 shares) John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments (726,854 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (462,179 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (85,532 shares)\n\nThe biggest risk for Amazon at the moment is the likelihood of a U.S. recession taking shape in the not-too-distant future. A couple of prominent money-based metrics and predictive tools suggest that the economy may weaken later this year. Since Amazon is the world's leading online marketplace and generates a sizable percentage of its sales from e-commerce, there's the logical perception that a recession would be trouble.\n\nYet what's interesting about Amazon is that very little of its operating cash flow or net income derives from online retail sales. Rather, the bulk of the company's cash flow and profits can be traced to its three fast-growing ancillary operating segments: Amazon Web Services (AWS), advertising services, and subscription services.\n\nA strong argument can be made that AWS is the single most important puzzle piece at Amazon. Enterprise cloud spending is still relatively early in its ramp, and AWS accounted for close to a third of global cloud infrastructure service spending during the September-ended quarter. In other words, a sustained double-digit growth rate should be the expectation for this high-margin segment.\n\nDon't overlook the importance of advertising services, either. Amazon is one of the most visited social sites in the world, with 2.3 billion to 2.7 billion aggregate visitors each month from July 2023 through December 2023. These are predominantly motivated shoppers, which makes Amazon a logical go-to for merchants wanting to target users with their message.\n\nWith regard to subscription services, Amazon surpassed 200 million worldwide Prime subscribers in April 2021, according to then-CEO Jeff Bezos. The addition of Thursday Night Football as exclusive content has likely only added to this figure.\n\nAlthough Amazon may not appear cheap based on traditional fundamental metrics, such as the price-to-earnings ratio, it's valued at a historically inexpensive multiple relative to its future cash flow. Billionaire investors recognize a long-term value when they see one.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

The processor, which will be available in Android smartphones from Chinese manufacturers including Xiaomi and Honor, is the second addition to Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 family.\n\nLike the original Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, Qualcomm is marketing the 8s Gen 3 as an on-device AI powerhouse. The company says that the processor supports a number of models including Meta's Llama 2 and Google's Gemini Nano.\n\nThe 8s Gen 3 places just below the standard 8 Gen 3 in terms of performance and pricing, meaning you'll likely find it in smartphones that are just under flagship devices. The company says it's taken a number of the major features from the top-of-the-line 8 Gen 3 and dropped them into the 8s Gen 3, including high-powered gaming performance.\n\nBut Qualcomm is largely positioning this chip as a generative AI processor. So far, on-device generative AI features include photo editing and real-time translation. Smartphone makers are increasingly leaning into the technology as a major selling point and the first major software change for devices in some time. Qualcomm is positioning its new Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 as a solid generative AI powerhouse. (Image: Qualcomm) (Qualcomm)\n\nThe smartphone market has largely remained stagnant over the last few years with only incremental changes to cameras and processing speeds. As a result, consumers are more apt to hold onto their devices for longer periods of time, slowing down overall sales.\n\nGenerative AI, however, could be just what the market needs: a new, flashy capability that gets consumers to update their phones as faster clips.\n\nAndroid smartphone makers are taking an early lead with the technology, with both Samsung and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) touting their latest offerings as generative AI-capable devices. Apple (AAPL) is widely expected to debut some kind of generative AI software during its WWDC developer conference, which will likely take place in June.\n\nWall Street analysts are pointing to generative AI as a potential catalyst for a boost in Apple's next-generation iPhone sales. And while the company hasn't made any announcements regarding what it's cooking up, CEO Tim Cook has said he sees generative AI as a \"huge opportunity for Apple\" and that the iPhone maker will show off what it's been developing later this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut generative AI apps and features are still in their early stages, and there's nothing quite interesting enough on the market yet to get people to start running out their front doors and into their nearest smartphone shops.

(Yahoo Finance)\n\nAnd some of the most well-known generative AI apps like ChatGPT are cloud-based, meaning it doesn't matter what kind of chip your smartphone is running; as long as you've got a connection to the internet, you'll likely be able to use the service.\n\nStill, as developers continue to develop the technology and roll it into more and more apps, chips capable of running them like the 8s Gen 3 will become increasingly important for users who want to take advantage of the software.\n\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.
