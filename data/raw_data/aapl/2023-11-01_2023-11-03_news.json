[{"date": "2023-11-03T23:16:51+00:00", "title": "Apple TV+ Is a Bright Spot in Apple's Mixed Quarterly Earnings", "content": "Apple CEO Tim Cook attends Apple TV+\u2019s \u201cThe Morning Show\u201d world premiere at David Geffen Hall on October 28, 2019 in New York City. Roy Rochlin/WireImage\n\nApple (AAPL)reported earnings for the September quarter yesterday (Nov. 2). The iPhone maker\u2019s overall sales declined for the fourth quarter in a row, sending its shares to fall in yesterday\u2019s after-hours trading. But there are several bright spots in the earnings report, including its \u201cservices\u201d business, which brought in $22.31 billion in quarterly revenue, up 16 percent from last year and an all-time high. Apple\u2019s services sector includes Apple TV+, Apple News+ and Apple One bundles, where users can subscribe to up to six services. iCloud storage, the Apple Store, Apple Care and advertising are also considered services. Apple CEO Tim Cook shouted out AppleTV+ on the call and boasted the accomplishments of original titles like Martin Scorsese\u2019s Killers of the FlowerMoon.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re telling impactful stories that inspire imagination and stir the soul,\u201d Cook said on yesterday\u2019s earnings calls with analysts. Cook also highlighted the success of Apple\u2019s partnership with Major League Soccer through the MLS Season Pass, saying subscriptions \u201cexceeded expectations\u201d within its first year.\n\n\u201cWe have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, nearly double the number we had only three years ago,\u201d CFO Luca Maestri said on the call.\n\nServices make up around 25 percent of Apple\u2019s total revenue. And the vast majority came from Google (GOOGL), which has an exclusive deal with Apple to make Google Search the default search engine on Apple devices. This year, Google is expected to pay Apple $19 billion for the search engine placement. During the September quarter, Apple brought in $89.5 billion in revenue and $22.96 billion in net income.\n\nCook said Apple\u2019s services sector is expected to grow at a similar rate in the current quarter. CFO Maestri credited the growth in services for helping Apple\u2019s gross margin, which was 45.2 percent in the past quarter. The margin is expected to be between 45 and 46 percent in the December quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nMaestri did clarify while answering a question from David Vogt of United Bank of Switzerland that the growth in services is not comparable with the performance of Apple\u2019s device business, which is likely to get a boost in revenue during the holiday season. The only product this past quarter that beat revenue expectations was the iPad. Sales of Macs and wearables, such as the Apple Watch, came lower than analysts had expected. iPhone sales, which accounted for about half of Apple\u2019s revenue, matched estimates in the past quarter.\n\nTrending Observer Stories\n\nSofia Coppola's Adolescent, Gushing, Empty-Headed 'Priscilla' Sugarcoats Elvis Bill Gates Turns 68: His Top 10 Quotes on Money, Success and Life Craig Newmark of Craigslist Has a New Mission: Saving Democracy Martin Scorsese's Strengths Seem Wasted in 'Killers of the Flower Moon' 10 Extraordinary UNESCO Sites to Explore Across America\n\nRead the original story Apple TV+ Is a Bright Spot in Apple's Mixed Quarterly Earnings and others by Nhari Djan at Observer.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-tv-bright-spot-apples-231651573.html", "symbols": ["AAPL.MX", "AAPL.US", "AAPL34.SA", "ABEA.F", "ABEA.XETRA", "ABEC.F", "ABEC.XETRA", "APC.F", "APC.XETRA", "GOGL34.SA", "GOGL35.SA", "GOOG.MX", "GOOG.US", "GOOGL.US"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.985, "neg": 0.034, "neu": 0.863, "pos": 0.104}}, {"date": "2023-11-03T22:29:00+00:00", "title": "Weekly Roundup", "content": "United Rentals was the star this week for our portfolio, while we dropped Universal Display.

While Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) impressed with its latest report, Apple joined Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) in disappointing analysts despite delivering strong quarterly figures as space was left for growth-related concerns. Although Apple topped revenue and profit estimates, its revenue contracted for fourth straight quarter, a stretch it hasn\u2019t made before it launched the iPhone back in 2007.\u00a0Shares fell as executives implied that the tech titan may not return to growth during the holiday quarter.\n\nQuarterly Highlights\n\nDuring the September quarter, Apple reported revenue dropped 1% YoY to $89.5 billion, topping LSEG\u2019s estimate of $89.28 billion but still showing that Apple\u2019s revenue continues to shrink as demand for every hardware business except the iPhone declined YoY, with big drops for iPad and Mac segments.\u00a0Revenue from greater China, its third largest market which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, is also a reason for concern as it dropped 2.5% to $15.08 billion, missing estimates by $2 billion due to intense competition in the region with\u00a0Huawei's comeback. The revenue slip came despite an unexpectedly strong acceleration in its services business as well as the iPhone\u2019s return to growth, helping the US consumer tech group withstand the worst effects of weaker consumer demand. However, CFO Luca Maestri noted that revenue would have risen had it not been for a 2 percentage point decline caused by exchange rate moves. Services revenue rose 16.3 per cent in the quarter, double the rate of the preceding three months and well ahead of the 11.4 per cent most analysts had been expecting\u00a0as it amounted to\u00a0$22.31 billion, topping LSEG\u2019s estimate of\u00a0$21.35 billion\u00a0and being a rare bright spot.\u00a0The performance boosted Apple\u2019s\u00a0quarterly\u00a0gross profit margin 45.2%,\u00a0which is a new\u00a0September quarter\u00a0record and Apple has its\u00a0\u00a0licensing deals with\u00a0Google to thank, along with its Apple Care, iCloud, TV+, etc.\u00a0A big chunk of the business comes from its deal with Google for the default search engine on\u00a0its\u00a0Safari\u00a0browser\u00a0which has been highlighted in recent weeks as part of the Department of Justice antitrust case against Google.\u00a0This year\u2019s payment to\u00a0Apple is worth an estimated $19 billion.\u00a0Cook\u00a0also revealed that\u00a0Apple had over 1 billion paid subscriptions,\u00a0including both its own\u00a0services and apps on the\u00a0App Store that bill on a recurring basis.\u00a0Net income for the quarter\u00a0amounted to\u00a0$22.96 billion, or $1.46 per share\u00a0with earnings per share\u00a0rising\u00a013%\u00a0to $1.46 thanks to the higher margin\u00a0from Apple Store sale\u00a0commissions and the share of search advertising revenue it receives from Google\u00a0which fueled the services segment.\n\nStory continues\n\nView more earnings on AAPL\n\nFull year results The fiscal year that ended in September\u00a0ended with\u00a0Apple\u2019s first revenue decline since a 2 per cent slip in 2019, with sales down\u00a03% at $383.29 billion.\u00a0Full year gross margins\u00a0were at a record\u00a044.1%. Although hardware revenue began to stabilise after\u00a0the first half of the year\u00a0during which\u00a0supply shortages and a\u00a0tormented\u00a0macroeconomic backdrop\u00a0dented\u00a0sales, it wasn\u2019t enough to end the year\u00a0the year without a\u00a0further decline.\u00a0However, CEO\u00a0Tim Cook\u00a0spiritedly defended\u00a0Apple\u2019s position, arguing that the iPhone appeared to gain market share in mainland China and increased sales\u00a0while the overall market is contracting.\n\nOutlook Was Lower Than What Wall Street Expected\n\nApple hasn\u2019t provided any official guidance since 2020. But, Maestri did say that he expects flat\u00a0revenue for the\u00a0undergoing\u00a0quarter\u00a0which will be one week shorter compared to last year\u2019s holiday quarter, disappointing Wall Street analysts that guided for 5% YoY growth. Although\u00a0last year\u2019s extra week made about 7% of quarterly revenue, Maestri\u2019s expectations does imply that Apple is expecting challenges during the holiday season while facing a continued weakness on the Mac, iPad and Wearables front, despite a relatively positive outlook for iPhone sales.\n\nApple Is Also Simultaneously Aiming For Box Office And Streaming Glory\n\nApple has invested heavily on Scorsese\u2019s latest creation, the Flower Moon. When it announced its collaboration with Paramount in 2020, the initial estimate of the film\u2019s production costs were guided in the range\u00a0between $180 million and $200 million. Bloomberg recently estimated costs of this bold cinema bet rose to about\u00a0$250 million. Although this hybrid release model is a gamble, Apple\u2019s intent is to convert\u00a0theater-goers into Apple TV+ subscribers. Even if it results in minor setbacks as\u00a0viewers might choose the immediate theater experience over waiting\u00a045 days\u00a0for an Apple TV+ release, Apple is strengthening its footprint in a very competitive industry.\n\nAnalysts Were Simply Expecting More From Apple\n\nLast week, Microsoft fueled optimism that\u00a0Big-Tech\u00a0is rebounding but Google and Apple toned down the optimism. Alphabet posted Cloud figures that raised concerns that Google is not gaining ground against its larger rivals nor benefiting from AI tailwinds. As for Apple,\u00a0analysts seem to think that it is lacking a clear path to growth this holiday season as its revenue contracted for the fourth consecutive quarter.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

It also didn\u2019t help that Q4 marked the fourth straight quarter of year-over-year declines in overall revenue, down 1% versus 2022.\n\nAnd with Apple CFO Luca Maestri expecting the company\u2019s iPad and Wearables, Home, and Accessories businesses to \u201cdecelerate significantly\u201d from the September quarter, it would seem that Apple is facing serious trouble.\n\nBut there were a handful of positive signs in the company\u2019s report and first-quarter guidance that could give the tech giant a boost moving forward including its performance in India and an expected jump in Mac sales.\n\nIndia and emerging markets get a boost\n\nApple has been investing a good deal in India over the past several years. Not only is the company leaning on the country as a new manufacturing hub for its products, including the all-important iPhone, it\u2019s also opened up its first physical stores in the region in Mumbai and New Delhi.\n\nAccording to UBS analyst David Vogt, while India accounted for just 4% of total iPhone sell-through in the 12 months prior to Sept. 2023, unit sales were up 31% in the country. That\u2019s compared to declines in the US, China, and Europe.\n\n\u201cWe had an all-time revenue record in India,\u201d Apple CEO Tim Cook said during the company\u2019s earnings call. \u201cWe grew very strong double digits. It's an incredibly exciting market for us and a major focus of ours. We have a low share in a large market. And so it would seem that there's a lot of headroom there.\u201d\n\nAccording to Cook, Apple is banking on more people moving into the middle class and better distribution in the country as boons for its presence there.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cI couldn't be happier with how things are going at the moment,\u201d he added.\n\nIt\u2019s not just India, though. Apple also launched new online stores in Chile, as well as Vietnam, where the company set new revenue records.

REUTERS/Francis Mascarenhas (Francis Mascarenhas / reuters)\n\nMac sales to rebound\n\nApple\u2019s Mac segment has been one of its biggest laggards among the company\u2019s various businesses over the last several quarters. In Q4, in particular, revenue fell 34% year-over-year from $11.5 billion to $7.6 billion this year, a 34% decline. But things could be turning around.\n\nDuring the company\u2019s earnings call, Maestri specifically called out the Mac business moving forward, saying that he expects year-over-year performance to \u201csignificantly accelerate in the current quarter.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s because Apple just launched its new M3 line of chips, as well as its M3-powered MacBook Pros and iMac. The systems should help drive an uptick in sales, compared to the same time last year when sales were falling.\n\nIt\u2019s important to also note that Apple\u2019s iPad and Mac revenue in particular were stung by year-over-year comparisons that were warped by production slowdowns and a subsequent jump in sales during 2022. How long the M3 chips will buoy Mac sales, however, remains to be seen. Apple debuted its latest MacBook Pros during its Scary Fast event. (Image: Apple) (Apple)\n\nServices is still a standout\n\nWhile Apple\u2019s hardware sales weren\u2019t enough to knock anyone\u2019s socks off, the company\u2019s Services business was a solid standout.\n\nRevenue jumped from $19.2 billion in Q4 2022 to $22.3 billion this year. In fact, Services revenue rose each quarter last year, a stark contrast to the rest of Apple\u2019s segments, which fell across various quarters.\n\n\u201cThe Apple flywheel is alive and well, following a 20-year success story in which consumers buy one Apple product, fall in love, buy another product, add a service, upgrade, and repeat,\u201d Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster wrote in an investor note.\n\nServices has long been seen as Apple\u2019s best hedge against falling iPhone sales, and with the declines over the last year, Services has been a help for the company\u2019s margins.\n\nFor 2024, Vogt says he expects Services revenue to increase 12% versus 2023 to $95.4 billion.\n\nWhile worries still abound among investors as to whether Apple\u2019s hardware segments will rebound after a difficult 2023, next year has a number of potential opportunities ahead, including more MacBook\u2019s running Apple\u2019s new M3 chips, and, importantly, the launch of the Vision Pro headset. And while that won\u2019t be a volume seller out of the gate, it could goose numbers in the future. Sign up for the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.

So, it\u2019s not just like send $20 to my friend. I\u2019m talking about, like, you won\u2019t need a bank account.\u201d\n\nPerhaps he will succeed. X has roughly 550 million active users and a payment processing system already in place. The firm also has licenses for money transmission and services in nine U.S. states, according to the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System. Most tellingly, Musk has even rebranded Twitter to the \u201cX.com\u201d name \u2014 the trademark he tried converting PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) into before getting ousted as CEO in 2000. He has the rare combination of money, willpower, and a lack of decorum to make things happen.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBut these efforts to turn X into a financial hub are doing things the hard way. Because instead of buying Twitter\u2026\n\n\u2026Elon Musk should have repurchased PayPal instead.\n\nPayPal: The Diamond in the Rough\n\nIt\u2019s been a tough several years for PayPal, an electronic payments company that\u2019s seen its share prices drop 85% since 2021. Over the past two years, analysts have cut their forward earnings estimates for PayPal from $7.20 per share to $4.95, sending PYPL stock into freefall.\n\nThe problem stems from a surge in expenses, driven by rising volumes of low-margin business and an uptick in credit losses. Credit card defaults are now growing at the fastest pace since the 2008 financial crisis. The growth of peer-to-peer transactions has also increased fraud rates.\n\nHowever, these downbeat figures have turned an otherwise growing company into a deep value play. Markets now value PayPal at only $56 billion \u2014 not much more than the $44 billion Elon Musk paid for Twitter.\n\nAt current prices, PayPal sits at just 11x free cash flow or 9.2x forward earnings \u2014 levels more typically seen at zero-growth industrial companies or struggling banks. Prices are so low that the company\u2019s $5-billion-per-year of free cash flow could theoretically pay for the entire company in just over seven years. (Twitter was bleeding $379 million annually when Musk took over).\n\nStory continues\n\nMeanwhile, PayPal\u2019s business continues to march ahead. Analysts expect PayPal\u2019s sales to increase between 7%-9% annually through at least 2025 and for earnings per share to return to double-digit growth after this year.\n\nThat\u2019s because PayPal\u2019s customer acquisition strategy largely relies on network effects, which costs virtually nothing to maintain. The company spends just over 10% on its entire sales and marketing team. By comparison, Capital One (NYSE:COF) pours a stunning 21% of its operating budget into marketing expenses. It\u2019s far cheaper to install a yellow \u201cPayPal Checkout\u201d button on a website than to get real-life customers to sign up for a \u201cWhat\u2019s In Your Wallet\u201d credit card.\n\nThat\u2019s turned PayPal into a profit-spinning machine despite lower margins. The company\u2019s return on capital exceeds 33%, and analysts expect free cash flows to rise double-digits through 2026.\n\nThe Actual Everything App\n\nMusk, however, might be even more interested in PayPal for its ownership of Venmo, a peer-to-peer payments app that PayPal acquired in 2013 through its purchase of Braintree. The service now counts at least 90 million accounts in the U.S., or 1 for every 3.5 people. Payment volumes are also surging. In Q2 2022, PayPal noted that Venmo saw a 250% transaction growth.\n\nThat\u2019s because Venmo enjoys even more robust network effects than PayPal. Venmo\u2019s peer-to-peer payment network only works if both parties have the same app, which means winners in the industry tend to keep growing while laggards are left behind. It\u2019s much like the Betamax vs. VHS wars of the 1980s. Once a standard is adopted, it\u2019s hard to switch to anything else.\n\nAt the moment, Venmo appears to be on the VHS side of that equation. The company has been using Cash App\u2019s playbook to acquire customers, offering cash prizes to sign up young users. The subsidiary has also been working with vendors and online merchants to serve Venmo as a payment option and broadening its reach beyond a peer-to-peer model.\n\nMost importantly (especially to Musk), Venmo and PayPal are expanding their credit and debit card offerings. This month, the firm announced that iPhone users will now be able to add these cards to their Apple Wallet, essentially cutting out the commercial bank middle-man. It\u2019s effectively becoming the center of users\u2019 financial worlds \u2014 or what Musk dreams X might someday become.\n\nThe Need for Patience\n\nOf course, an investment in PayPal comes with risks. My MarketMasterAI stock-picking system awards PayPal a C grade for its negative momentum and analyst downgrades. History tells us that falling stocks usually keep going down before a recovery. According to the quantitative system, PayPal\u2019s expected stock return is only 2.3% over the next six months.\n\nPayPal is also facing growing competition\u2026 not least from Musk\u2019s X app. In 2019, the payments sector saw several blockbuster acquisitions consolidating the market. Fidelity National Information Services (NYSE:FIS) acquired Worldpay in a $43 billion deal, Fiserv (NYSE:FI) scooped up First Data for $22 billion, and Global Payments (NYSE:GPN) bought TSYS for $21.5 billion. These efforts were aimed directly at competing against PayPal.\n\nFinally, PayPal\u2019s move into debit and credit cards comes with banking-related risks. In 2022, the company booked $402 million in credit losses, representing around 6.8% of all outstanding loans. Much of this increase came from buy-now-pay-later products, which typically have high default rates. As PayPal continues to add banking-related services to its product lineup, investors will need to price the firm more like a bank, which typically trades at significant discounts.\n\nLessons From Apple Pay\n\nNevertheless, the experience of Apple Pay tells us why it would have been easier for Elon Musk to buy PayPal instead of converting Twitter into a financial hub.\n\nIn 2014, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) CEO Tim Cook proclaimed that his firm would \u201cforever change the way all of us buy things.\u201d His firm launched Apple Pay that October and aggressively pursued merchants to adopt the system. By 2019, even the New York transit system allowed Apple Pay on subways and buses.\n\nHowever, even Apple couldn\u2019t get its customers to switch.\n\nAccording to a study by Capital One, only 9.3% of iPhone owners used Apple Pay for in-store purchases in 2022. That\u2019s despite Apple Pay being accepted at 90% of U.S. retail stores. Even high-yield Apple savings accounts \u2014 which currently yield 4.15% APRs\u2014 have struggled to gain customers. The $10 billion deposited into Apple Card\u2019s savings accounts is just $6.85 per active iPhone user.\n\nThat\u2019s because banking habits are hard to change. According to Bankrate, the average U.S. consumer holds onto the same checking account for 17.75 years. Younger millennials under 32 have kept their checking accounts for over nine years. There\u2019s a reason why local banks and credit unions give handsome sign-up bonuses for new accounts. Nine years of Apple Pay has only given the Cupertino-based firm a 12.62% share of the online payments market.\n\nThen there\u2019s PayPal, a company that controls 56.15% of online payments. Its shares are trading at multi-year lows. It\u2019s highly profitable. It generates plenty of cash. And it\u2019s available on public markets for you and me to buy. Better act now before Musk decides to make another purchase.\n\nAs of this writing, Tom Yeung\u00a0did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Companies categorized as dividend aristocrats have a decades-long history of periodically distributing dividends, making them a good source of income during turbulent market conditions and recessionary fears.\n\nBuffett, who currently ranks No. 5 on the Forbes real-time billionaires list with a net worth of $114 billion, is a stalwart supporter of industry-leading blue chip stocks.\n\n\"Beware the investment activity that produces applause; the great moves are usually greeted by yawns,\" Buffett once said.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nInvesting in real estate just got a whole lot simpler. With as little as $100, average investors are becoming landlords thanks to this Jeff Bezos-backed startup. Elon Musk has reportedly bought 6,000 acres of land just outside of Austin.

He called out the Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE:KO) in Berkshire Hathaway's 2022 shareholder letter, stating, \"[Dividend] growth occurred every year, just as certain as birthdays.\"\n\nBuffett and his right-hand man Charlie Munger, vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, invested $1.3 billion in Coca-Cola, obtaining 400 million shares in 1994 when it generated a dividend income of $75 million. As of 2022, annual dividends from Coca-Cola shares have catapulted to $704 million \u2014 a more than 800% rise in less than three decades.\n\nStory continues\n\nBerkshire Hathaway's stake in Coca-Cola was valued at $25 billion as of 2022, marking a more than 1,800% rise from the initial investment of $1.3 billion. As of last year, Coca-Cola stock accounted for approximately 5% of Berkshire Hathaway's total holdings.\n\nAmerican Express Co.\n\nBuffett made similar gains from his investment in American Express Co. (NYSE:AXP). He invested nearly $1.3 billion in American Express in 1995, which is now valued at $22 billion. This marks a nearly 1,600% rise in valuation.\n\nCapital gains are not the only benefit American Express stock has generated for Buffett. The world's largest portfolio manager also pocketed dividend income of $302 million from his American Express holdings in 2022, up from $41 million during the initial investment in 1995.\n\n\"Those [American Express dividend] checks, too, seem highly likely to increase,\" Buffett said in Berkshire Hathaway's 2022 shareholder letter. American Express shares also account for nearly 5% of Hathaway's net worth.\n\nApple Inc.\n\nWhile Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is not considered a dividend stock by most investors, the tech giant's dividend payouts have made the stock one of Buffett's family jewels. Berkshire Hathaway holds a nearly 5.8% stake in Apple.\n\nBuffett describes Apple as a \"better business than any we own.\" He credits his substantial stake in Apple to multiple share repurchases executed by the company over the years, making it \"costless\" for Berkshire Hathaway to increase its Apple stock holdings.\n\nBuffett's dividend income from Apple averaged about $775 million annually as of 2020, according to Berkshire Hathaway's 2020 shareholder letter. Apple currently has 11 consecutive years of dividend growth history.\n\nEarn Money While You Sleep: Warren Buffett famously said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" It's time to put your investments to work.

I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\n\nStory continues\n\nTimothy D. Cook\n\nThank you, Suhasini. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Today, Apple is reporting revenue of $89.5 billion for the September quarter. We achieved an all-time revenue record in India as well as September quarter records in several countries, including Brazil, Canada, France, Indonesia, Mexico, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the UAE, Vietnam and more. iPhone revenue came in ahead of our expectations, setting a September quarter record as well as quarterly records in many markets, including China Mainland, Latin America, the Middle East, South Asia and an all-time record in India.\r\nIn Services, we set an all-time revenue record with double-digit growth and ahead of our expectations. During the September quarter, we continued to face an uneven macroeconomic environment, including foreign exchange headwinds, and we've navigated these challenges by following the same principles that have always guided us. We've continued to invest in the future and managed for the long term. We've adapted continuously to circumstances beyond our control while being thoughtful and deliberate on spending.\r\nAnd we've carved a path of groundbreaking innovations and delivered with excellence every step of the way. That includes Apple Vision Pro, which has gotten such an amazing response from developers who are currently creating truly incredible apps. We're excited to get this magical product in the hands of customers early next year.\r\nNow let me share more about our products, beginning with iPhone. iPhone revenue came in at $43.8 billion, 3% higher than a year ago and a new record for the September quarter. This fall, we were thrilled to debut the iPhone 15 lineup. The all-new iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus feature a gorgeous design, powerful cameras and the intuitive Dynamic Island. Powered by the industry-leading A17 Pro, our iPhone 15 Pro lineup has a beautiful, strong and durable titanium design and the best iPhone camera system ever, including a 5x telephoto lens on iPhone 15 Pro Max. Customers are loving the entire iPhone 15 family and reviews have been off the charts.\r\nIn Mac, revenue came in at $7.6 billion, down 34% year-over-year from the prior year's record quarter. This was due to challenging market conditions as well as difficult compares against the supply disruptions and subsequent demand recapture we experienced a year ago. Earlier this week, we were excited to unveil the next generation of Apple silicon with our incredible family of M3 chips, M3, M3 Pro and M3 Max. We're continuing to innovate at a tremendous pace, and our industry-leading lineup of personal computers just got even better. The new MacBook Pro lineup brings our most advanced technology to our pro users while iMac, the world's best-selling all-in-one, just got faster and more capable. And according to the latest data from Student Monitor, nearly 2 out of 3 college students chose a Mac. We couldn't be more excited about the future.\r\nTurning to iPad. Revenue for the September quarter was $6.4 billion. iPad sets the gold standard for tablets, and our competitors are unable to match the iPad experience that is enabled by our seamless integration of hardware and software. iPad is also our most versatile product. In classrooms around the world, it's helping educators bring lessons to life while giving students a window into the world around them. And in artist's workshops, design studios, and everywhere else creative minds come together, iPad supercharges the creative process, helping users take their ideas further than they ever could before.\r\nAcross Wearables, Home and Accessories, revenue came in at $9.3 billion. Apple Watch has become essential in our lives and this is our best Apple Watch lineup ever. With Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2, we're giving people even more tools to stay safe and live healthy, active lives. With the new double tap gesture, users can easily control Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 using just 1 hand and without touching the display. It feels like magic. Our latest Apple Watch lineup also includes our first-ever carbon-neutral products, a significant achievement of innovation and determination.\r\nApple's unique ecosystem of hardware, software and services delivers an unparalleled user experience. During the quarter, we also had the chance to introduce a range of exciting new updates to our software that will allow users to get even more out of their devices. Whether it's personalized contact posters and new FaceTime features in iOS 17, new tools for users to make their experience their own in macOS Sonoma and iPadOS 17 or a bold new look in watchOS 10 that lets you see and do more faster than ever, Apple is delivering an even better, richer experience that users are loving.\r\nServices revenue set an all-time record of $22.3 billion, a 16% year-over-year increase. We achieved all-time revenue records across App Store, advertising, AppleCare, iCloud, payment services and video as well as a September quarter revenue record in Apple Music. Whether subscribers are waking up to headlines on Apple News+, getting their morning workout in with Fitness+, feeling the beat with Apple Music on their way to work or school or unwinding at the end of the day with Apple Arcade, we have so many different services to enrich their day.\r\nApple TV+ continues to delight customers as well with new and returning shows like The Morning Show, Lessons in Chemistry and Monarch, we're telling impactful stories that inspire imagination and stir the soul. Making movies that make a difference is also at the heart of Apple TV+, and we were thrilled to produce Martin Scorsese's Killers of the Flower Moon, a powerful work of cinema that premiered in theaters around the world last month. We're proud to say that since launch just over 4 years ago, Apple TV+ has earned nearly 1,600 award nominations and nearly 400 wins.\r\nWe also offer subscribers an unprecedented live sports experience with MLS Season Pass. We couldn't be more pleased with how our partnership with Major League Soccer has gone in its first year. Subscriptions to MLS Season Pass have exceeded our expectations, and we're excited to continue that momentum next year. With the playoffs now underway, we can't wait to see who takes home the MLS Cup.\r\nAnd nowhere does the magic of Apple come alive more than it does in our stores. Over the past year, we've continued to find ways to connect with even more customers. We welcomed customers to our first-ever retail locations in India. We also opened doors to new stores in Korea, China and the U.K. and expanded the Apple Store online to Vietnam and Chile. And we have another store opening in China this week. In September, I joined our team at Apple Fifth Avenue on launch day and the energy and excitement were unbelievable.\r\nEvery time we connect with a customer, we're reminded why we do what we do. From simple joys of creating and sharing memories to life-saving features like Emergency SOS via satellite, we're enriching lives in ways large and small. And whether we're working to safeguard user privacy, ensure technology made by Apple is accessible for everyone or build an even more inclusive workplace, we're determined to lead with our values.\r\nOur environmental efforts are a great example of the intersection of our work and our values. Across Apple, we act on a simple premise: the best products in the world should be the best products for the world. We've made our environmental work a central focus of our innovation because we feel a responsibility to leave the world better than we found it and because we know that climate change cannot be stopped unless everyone steps up and does their part.\r\nOur first-ever carbon-neutral products represent a major milestone, and we're going to go even further. We plan to make every product across our lineup carbon-neutral by the end of the decade. And we're not doing it alone. Over 300 of our suppliers have committed to using 100% clean energy for Apple production by 2030. We also continue to invest in entrepreneurs who are lighting the way for a greener, more equitable future. Through our third Impact Accelerator class, we're proud to support a new class of diverse innovators on the cutting edge of green technology and clean energy.\r\nApple is always looking forward, driven in equal measure by a sense of possibility and a deep belief in our purpose. We're motivated by the meaningful difference we can make for our customers and keenly determine to push the limits of technology even further. And that's why I'm so confident that Apple's future is bright. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca.\n\nLuca Maestri\n\nThank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the September quarter was $89.5 billion, down less than 1% from last year. Foreign exchange had a negative impact of over 2 percentage points, and on a constant currency basis, our revenue grew year-over-year in total and in each geographic segment. We set a September quarter record in the Americas and saw strong performance across our emerging markets, where both iPhone and Services grew double digits.\r\nProducts revenue was $67.2 billion, down 5% from last year due to very challenging compares on both Mac and iPad, which I will discuss in more detail later on. At the same time, we reached a September quarter record on iPhone, driven by strength in emerging markets. Our total installed base of active devices reached an all-time high across all products and all geographic segments, thanks to our high levels of customer satisfaction and many new customers joining our ecosystem.\r\nOur Services revenue set an all-time record of $22.3 billion, up 16% year-over-year, with growth accelerating sequentially from the June quarter. Our performance in Services was broad-based as we reached all-time revenue records in the Americas, Europe and rest of Asia Pacific and a September quarter record in Greater China. We also set new records in every Services category.\r\nCompany gross margin set a September quarter record at 45.2%, up 70 basis points sequentially, driven by leverage and favorable mix partially offset by foreign exchange. Products gross margin was 36.6%, up 120 basis points sequentially, also driven by leverage and mix, partially offset by foreign exchange. Services gross margin was 70.9%, up 40 basis points from last quarter due to a different mix. Operating expenses of $13.5 billion were at the low end of the guidance range we provided, up 2% year-over-year. Net income was $23 billion, diluted earnings per share was $1.46, up 13% versus last year and a September quarter record, and operating cash flow was strong at $21.6 billion.\r\nLet me now provide more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $43.8 billion, up 3% year-over-year and a new September quarter record. We had strong performance in several markets, including an all-time record in India and September quarter records in Canada, Latin America, the Middle East and South Asia. Our iPhone active installed base grew to a new all-time high, and fiscal 2023 was another record year for switchers. We continue to see extremely high levels of customer satisfaction, which 451 Research recently measured at 98% in the U.S.\r\nMac revenue was $7.6 billion, down 34% year-over-year, driven by challenging market conditions and compounded by a difficult compare in our own business, whereby last year, we experienced supply disruptions from factory shutdowns in the June quarter and we are subsequently able to fulfill significant pent-up demand during the September quarter. We also had a difference in launch timing, with the MacBook Air launching earlier this year in the June quarter compared to the September quarter last year. We have great confidence in our Mac lineup and are excited about the recently announced iMac and MacBook Pro powered by our M3 chips. Our installed base is at an all-time high, and half of Mac buyers during the quarter were new to the product, driven by MacBook Air. Also, we saw reported customer satisfaction of 97% for Mac in the U.S.\r\niPad generated $6.4 billion in revenue, down 10% year-over-year. Similar to Mac, these results were a function of a difficult compare from the supply disruptions in the June quarter a year ago and the subsequent fulfillment of pent-up demand in the September quarter. iPad continues to attract a large number of new customers to the installed base, with over half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter being new to the product. And the latest reports from 451 Research indicate customer satisfaction of 98% in the U.S.\r\nWearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $9.3 billion, down 3% year-over-year. We had a September quarter record in Europe, and we saw strong performance in several emerging markets around the world. Apple Watch continues to expand its reach, with nearly 2/3 of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product. And customer satisfaction for the Watch was recently measured at 97% in the U.S.\r\nServices had a great quarter. We reached a new all-time revenue record of $22.3 billion, up 16% year-over-year. And we're happy to see growth coming from all categories and every geographic segment, which is a direct result of the strength of our ecosystem. Our installed base of over 2 billion active devices continues to grow at a nice pace and establishes a solid foundation for the future expansion of the ecosystem. And we continue to see increased customer engagement with our Services. Both transacting accounts and paid accounts grew double digits year-over-year, each reaching a new all-time high.\r\nAlso, our paid subscriptions showed strong growth. We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, nearly double the number we had only 3 years ago. And finally, we continue to improve the breadth and quality of our current services from exciting new content on Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade to additional storage tiers on iCloud. We believe our customers will love these new offerings.\r\nTurning to enterprise, we are excited to see our business customers in both developed and emerging markets expand their deployment of Apple products and technologies to drive business innovation and employee satisfaction. Starbucks continues to invest in Apple technology to bring the best experience to their customers and employees, including tens of thousands of iPads across all retail stores to help their teams streamline order management, operations and training. In addition, Starbucks recently refreshed over 10,000 Macs to the latest M2-powered MacBook Air for all store managers, enabling them to do their best work and improve productivity.\r\nAnd in Indonesia, popular technology company GoTo is offering Mac as a choice so that employees can have the best tools to be most productive. Today, more than half of its workforce are already choosing Mac for work.\r\nLet me now turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with over $162 billion in cash and marketable securities. We increased commercial paper by $2 billion, leaving us with total debt of $111 billion. As a result, net cash was $51 billion at the end of the quarter, and our goal of becoming net cash-neutral over time remains unchanged. During the quarter, we returned nearly $25 billion to shareholders, including $3.8 billion in dividends and equivalents and $15.5 billion through open market repurchases of 85 million Apple shares. We also began a $5 billion accelerated share repurchase program in August, resulting in the initial delivery and retirement of 22 million shares.\r\nTaking a step back as we close our 2023 fiscal year, our annual revenue was $383 billion. While it was down 3% from the prior year, it grew on a constant currency basis despite a volatile and uneven macroeconomic environment. Our year-over-year revenue performance improved each quarter as we went through the year and so did our earnings per share performance as we reported double-digit EPS growth in the September quarter.\r\nWe are particularly pleased with our performance in emerging markets, with revenue reaching an all-time record in fiscal 2023 and double-digit growth in constant currency. We are expanding our direct presence in these markets from new Apple retail stores in India to online stores in Vietnam and Chile. And we continue to work with our partners to offer a wide range of affordability programs so that we can best serve our customers. We're very excited about the momentum we have in these markets and the opportunity ahead of us.\r\nAs we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to at the beginning of the call. The color we are providing today assumes that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. Also, on foreign exchange, we expect a negative year-over-year revenue impact of about 1 percentage point.\r\nAs a reminder, the December quarter this year will last the usual 13 weeks, whereas the December quarter a year ago spanned 14 weeks. For clarity, revenue from the extra week last year added approximately 7 percentage points to the quarter's total revenue. Despite having 1 less week this year, we expect our December quarter total company revenue to be similar to last year. We expect iPhone revenue to grow year-over-year on an absolute basis. We also expect to grow after normalizing for both last year's supply disruptions and the 1 extra week.\r\nWe expect Mac year-over-year performance to significantly accelerate from the September quarter. We expect the year-over-year revenue performance for both iPad and Wearables, Home and Accessories to decelerate significantly from the September quarter due to a different timing of product launches. On iPad, we launched a new iPad Pro and iPad tenth generation during the December quarter a year ago. For the Wearables category, last year, we had the full December quarter benefit from the launches of the AirPods Pro second generation, the Watch SE and the first Watch Ultra.\r\nFor our Services business, we expect the average revenue per week to grow at a similar strong double-digit rate as it did during the September quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 45% and 46%. We expect OpEx to be between $14.4 billion and $14.6 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $200 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments and our tax rate to be around 16%.\r\nFinally, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.24 per share of common stock payable on November 16, 2023, to shareholders of record as of November 13, 2023. With that, let's open the call to questions.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nThank you, Luca. (Operator Instructions) Operator, may we have the first question, please?\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nOperator\n\nWe will go ahead and take our first question from Mike Ng of Goldman Sachs.\n\nMichael Ng\n\nI just have a question on iPhone storage and demand versus iCloud. As demand for storage grows, are you seeing a mix shift towards higher storage iPhone models? Or are consumers mostly opting for the same because of increased uptake of iCloud+? What are some of the strategic and financial considerations here and trade-offs as you think about the mix shift towards higher storage models versus iCloud penetration?\n\nTimothy D. Cook\n\nMichael, it's Tim. As you probably know, we started the line with the iPhone Pro Max at 256, and so we are seeing a different mix, if you will, this year than last year. Outside of that, not significant changes.\n\nMichael Ng\n\nAnd as a separate follow-up, I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the market conditions on notebooks and desktops. And any color that you can share regarding the timing of the M3 MacBook Pros this year versus the M2 earlier in the calendar year?\n\nTimothy D. Cook\n\nYes. We're thrilled to have announced the M3 lineup and get the new MacBook Pro and the new iMac out there. We couldn't be more excited about it. As Luca said, with the lineup that we've got and the compare issue that we don't have during Q1, we anticipate a significant acceleration in the Mac space for Q1.\r\nTo just repeat a little bit about the circumstances of the performance last quarter, in the year-ago June quarter, we had a factory disruption that lasted several weeks. The pent-up demand that resulted from that was filled in the September quarter. And that made the September quarter not only a record but a substantial record. And obviously, we're now comparing against that for '23. And so that -- I wouldn't look at the negative 34% as representative of the underlying business performance, is sort of the net of it.\n\nMichael Ng\n\nExcellent. That's very clear.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.\n\nAaron Christopher Rakers\n\nCongratulations on the execution in the quarter. I'm curious, Tim, if you could help us characterize what the demand environment you're seeing in China looks like? How has the reception been to the iPhone 15? And kind of a similar question to the prior one. How would you characterize the mix within China as you go through this current product cycle? And I have a follow-up.\n\nTimothy D. Cook\n\nYes. If you look at how we did in Greater China for the quarter, we came in at, on revenue basis, minus 2. But one thing to keep in mind here is that the FX impact was nearly 6 points. So we grew in constant currency. And underneath that, if you look at the different -- the categories, iPhone actually set a September quarter record in Mainland China.\r\nAnd the -- what pulled down the performance was a combination largely of Mac and iPad. Services also grew during the quarter. And the Mac and iPad suffered from the same issues that the company did with the compare issues to factory disruptions in Q3 that were filled subsequently in Q4 of '22. In addition to that, we had the top 4 selling phones in urban China for last year. And I was -- I just -- I took a trip over there and could not be more excited about the interactions I had with customers and employees and others.\n\nAaron Christopher Rakers\n\nYes. And then as a quick follow-up, I'm curious as we move towards more of an inflationary component pricing environment. Luca, how do we think about that effect or how you're thinking about the gross margin at the product level as maybe component pricing starts to turn what's been clearly very favorable over the last several quarters to more of an inflationary environment?\n\nLuca Maestri\n\nAs you've seen from our results in Q4 and the guidance for Q1, we're obviously experiencing very strong levels of gross margin. The 45.2% was a record for the September quarter, and then the guidance for Q1 is obviously strong at 45% to 46%. Our gross margins are affected by multiple factors. Obviously, the commodity environment is one of them, as you mentioned. It's been a good environment in recent quarters. But equally important is the mix of what we sell, and obviously, growth in Services for us is favorable. And that has helped our company gross margin.\r\nForeign exchange, on the other hand, has been a drag for several quarters, given the strength of the dollar. We don't provide guidance past the December quarter, which is like a very important one for us because it's the beginning of the product cycle for many products. And so we feel very good, very confident about this coming year, and I think the gross margin guidance reflects that.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley.\n\nErik William Richard Woodring\n\nMaybe if I start -- Luca, I know that the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max are constrained today, but I think some of your comments suggest you should be back to supply-demand balance before quarter end. So I guess my question is, does your December quarter revenue guidance account for any supply constraints? And if so, is there any way to kind of quantify how much supply would be limiting your December quarter revenue performance? And then I have a follow-up.\n\nLuca Maestri\n\nYes, it's correct. We are constrained today on iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max. We're working very hard to get the product in the hands of all the customers that have ordered it. We expect, as of today, that we're going to be in supply-demand balance by the end of the quarter, so the guidance reflects that.\n\nErik William Richard Woodring\n\nOkay, very clear. And then maybe for you and Tim, you guys have been on the leading edge of innovation across hardware, software, silicon services. And I'm sure there's plenty of technologies and kind of longer-term projects that you're investing in. How should we think about your capital intensity as we look to fiscal year '24, just given over the last few years, CapEx as a percentage of revenue has been relatively low compared to the 8 years prior?\r\nSo should we expect a step up or kind of similar capital intensity? And what are the more notable moving pieces, if any, that we should be thinking about?\n\nLuca Maestri\n\nWell, the big areas of investment for us are tooling and equipment for manufacturing plants, our investments in data centers, and our investments in our own facilities, both corporate facilities and retail stores. And so both for the tooling in our plants and our data center investments, we tend to have a bit of a hybrid model where we share some of the investments with our partners and suppliers. And so maybe that's why you see sometimes a bit of variability.\r\nBut over the last few years, we made all the investments that we needed to make. And obviously, we're planning to make all the investments that we believe are needed and appropriate in order to continue to innovate.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from David Vogt with UBS.\n\nDavid Vogt\n\nI know you covered China. I want to pivot to the U.S. for a second. Obviously, iPhone and the business looks like it returned to growth in the quarter, but it's still relatively softer, kind of where I thought it would be at this point in the cycle. And some of the U.S. carriers obviously haven't been that particularly aggressive in promoting upgrades. So just wanted to kind of get a sense, first, what you're seeing from your partners in the U.S. kind of currently and going forward, and what do you expect?\r\nAnd then second, Luca, on the margins. I mean, is it fair to say that the mix in Q1 from a product versus Services dynamic is kind of the key driver of the better gross margin guide as a whole relative to, let's say, the December quarter? Or is there anything else? I know you mentioned there's a lot of moving pieces, but is that the primary driver of the uplift in the margin?\n\nTimothy D. Cook\n\nOn the U.S. carriers and the U.S. business in general, it's really too early to call the iPhone cycle, particularly with the constraint around the Pro and the Pro Max, and the U.S. tends to do quite well with those products. It's really too early to tell what the upgrade rates will be and what the switcher rates will be.\n\nLuca Maestri\n\nOn the margin side, if I understood your question correctly about the December quarter guidance, keep in mind that actually, December is the quarter where our products business is -- tends to be very heavy because of the holiday season. And so the Services gross margins that are accretive to total company have an impact but not as meaningful as other quarters during the year.\r\nAnd so I think that the main drivers of the guidance that we provided are the fact that we are seeing improved costs and improved mix on our the product side of the business, partially offset by foreign exchange, which continues to be a drag, both sequentially and on a year-over-year basis.\n\nDavid Vogt\n\nGot it. So the weakness in iPad and Wearables are less of an impact on sort of the margin trajectory in the December quarter, I guess?\n\nLuca Maestri\n\nThat's correct, that's correct.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore.\n\nAmit Jawaharlaz Daryanani\n\nI have 2 as well. I guess first off, just the Services growth rate, there was a tremendous acceleration, I think, in September quarter to 16% growth. And it sounds like it's going to hold there pretty well into December. Can you just talk about what is driving this acceleration? Are there a couple of products that have just stepped up in a very meaningful way? Just maybe flush out like what is driving the acceleration because it's fairly notable compared to what you've been seeing the last few quarters.\n\nLuca Maestri\n\nWe had a really strong quarter across the border, I mean, because both geographically and from a product category standpoint, we saw very significant growth. I mentioned the records on a geographic basis. And from a category standpoint, literally, we set records in each one of the big categories. We had all-time record for App Store, for advertising, for cloud, video, Apple Care, Payments and a September quarter record for Music. So it's hard to pick one in particular because they all did well. And really then we step back and we think about why is it that our Services business is doing well, and it's because we have an installed base of customers that continues to grow at a very nice pace, and the engagement in our ecosystem continues to grow.\r\nWe have more transacting accounts. We have more paid accounts. We have more subscriptions on the platform. And we continue to add. We continue to add content and features. We're adding a lot of content on TV+, new games on Apple Arcade, new features, new storage plans for iCloud. So it's the combination of all these things and the fact that the engagement in the ecosystem is improving, and therefore, it benefits every Service category.\n\nAmit Jawaharlaz Daryanani\n\nGot it, that's really helpful. And then maybe if I could ask you about Vision Pro, which I believe is supposed to be launched more broadly sometime in 2024, the early part of the year. I'm curious how different do you think the launch and the consumer education of this product or a new category will be versus other things like AirPods or Apple Watch that you've done? And then perhaps any themes that stood out to you from the developers that have been able to use this in the developer labs? What feedback have you gotten from them?\n\nTimothy D. Cook\n\nYes, that's a great question. There's a tremendous amount of excitement around the Vision Pro, and we're -- we've been very happy to share it with developers. We have developer labs set up in different parts of the world so that they can actually get their hands on it and are working on apps. And I've been fortunate enough to see a number of those. And there's some real blow away kinds of things that are coming out. And so that all looks good.\r\nTo answer your question about, is it similar to AirPods or Apple Watch? I would say no, there's never been a product like the Vision Pro. And so we're purposely bringing it out in our stores only so we can really put a great deal of attention on the last mile of it. We'll be offering demos in the stores, and it will be a very different process than the normal grab-and-go kind of process.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler.\n\nHarsh V. Kumar\n\nCongratulations on tremendous execution in a very tough macro. Actually, Tim, the last question is a perfect segue here, given what you are doing with your Vision Pro. So lots of companies are experimenting with generative AI. I'm curious about what kind of efforts you have. I'm sure there are segways into Pro Vision (sic) [Vision Pro] that you have. But I was curious about if you can give us a glimpse on how you might be able to monetize some of these efforts with generative AI.\n\nTimothy D. Cook\n\nIf you kind of zoom out and look at what we've done on AI and machine learning and how we've used it, we view AI and machine learning as fundamental technologies, and they're integral to virtually every product that we ship. And so just recently, when we shipped iOS 17, it had features like Personal Voice and Live Voicemail. AI is at the heart of these features. And then you can go all the way to then life-saving features on the Watch and the phone like fall detection, crash detection, ECG on the watch. These would not be possible without AI.\r\nAnd so we don't label them as such, if you will. We label them as to what their consumer benefit is, but the fundamental technology behind it is AI and machine learning. In terms of generative AI, we have -- obviously, we have work going on. I'm not going to get into details about what it is because as you know, we really don't do that. But you can bet that we're investing, we're investing quite a bit. We are going to do it responsibly. And it will -- you will see product advancements over time where those technologies are at the heart of them.\n\nHarsh V. Kumar\n\nVery clear. And for my follow-up, I had a philosophical question. So you guys always try to provide the best experience for consumers. To that end, I think over the last decade, you in-sourced a lot of important chips in your phones and your Macs, iPads, so on and so forth. And that was, I think, a function that ARM wasn't around in the industry from a merchant angle. But now we see these -- the silicon guys, the chip guys moving to ARM architecture.\r\nSo my question to you is, has the move to internal silicon been economically profitable proposition for Apple? Or is it a strategic one where you simply need to own this and it's vital to your products for the consumer experience? Or maybe there's a path back to chip vendors at some point in time?\n\nTimothy D. Cook\n\nIt's really enabled us to build products that we could not build without doing it ourselves. And as you know, we like to own the primary technologies in the products that we ship. And arguably, the silicon is at the heart of the primary technologies. And so no, I don't see going back. I am happier today than I was yesterday, than I was last week, that we made the transition that we've made and I see the benefit every day of it.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America.\n\nWamsi Mohan\n\nTim, over the last decade pretty much, you've gained a lot of share in China. As you look here, some of the domestic players are starting to reemerge, especially in the high-end phone space. I know you touched on China, but how would you see Apple's positioning and opportunity for continued share gains, particularly in China? And how was the linearity in China from a demand perspective? And I have a follow-up, please.\n\nTimothy D. Cook\n\nIn the September quarter, we set an iPhone record -- revenue record in China, and we're very proud of that. And we obviously grew. The market predictions that I've seen would have the market contracting. And so if that's -- if those are correct, then we gained share last quarter. And so we're very proud of that. I don't know what every quarter will hold, and obviously, we just give a bit of color on the current quarter. But over the long term, I view China is an incredibly important market and I'm very optimistic about it.\n\nWamsi Mohan\n\nOkay. And as a follow-up, you obviously had a great Services quarter. And part of your Services business has these licensing relationships with search partners where you serve a very important distribution function for them. Can you talk about how you think about these relationships and potentially some of the options maybe Apple has to mitigate some of the risk, given some of the scrutiny on -- with some of these search partners?\n\nTimothy D. Cook\n\nThey are important relationships. And as you know, we don't get into our commercial relationships in the call. I see them as important and we make decisions that are in the best interest of our users or what we feel is in the best interest of our users. And that's kind of what we've done in the past and how we run the show in the future as well.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen.\n\nKrish Sankar\n\nI have 2 of them, too. First one, Luca, thanks for the color on gross margin. And when I look at it over the last 4 quarters, even if on a year-over-year basis, revenue declined, the gross margins have improved, and I understand Services definitely helps. I'm just kind of curious, when you look at on a go-forward basis, most of the big step functions and cost reductions like the Mac silicon conversion, et cetera, that are done? Or is there more room for margin expansion from here? And then I have a follow-up.\n\nLuca Maestri\n\nWell, on the products side, as you know, we -- when we launch new products, the cost structures of those products tend to be higher than the products that they replace. It happens because we're always adding new technologies, new features, and then we work through the cost curve over the life cycle of the product, and we tend to get benefits as time goes by.\r\nThe guidance that we provided for December reflects all that. And so we're starting from a better position than a year ago or than in the past in general. There are other factors that play a role. For example, the mix of products that we sell. Not every product has the same gross margin profile. And so our guidance, our results are reflective of that. And also within a specific product category, a lot depends on the kind of models that we sell because they have different margin profiles.\r\nI think one of the things that we've done well over the last few years is to offer more affordability solutions to our customers in the form of installment plans, trading options and low-cost financing in general. And what that is accomplished is reduce the affordability threshold for our customers, and therefore, they can buy at the top of our product ranges. That has been a big factor in the reason for our margin expansion.\r\nYou know we don't provide guidance or color past the current quarter because there's so many different variables that affect gross margins. But we obviously feel very good about the trajectory that we've had in 2023 and now the guidance that we provide for the beginning of our fiscal '24. And we need some of these things because, obviously, the foreign exchange environment has been difficult and has been a bit of a drag for us. But net-net, we're very pleased where we are.\n\nKrish Sankar\n\nGot it. And then a follow-up for Tim. Obviously, you're seeing amazing momentum in India. I'm just kind of curious, how do you look at -- when you look at the India growth opportunity, on these hardware units? How do you think about ASP relative to that versus like the rest of the geographies? And is there a way to compare or contrast India growth momentum versus China maybe a decade ago or so at the same point as the rollout of the share gains in that geography?\n\nTimothy D. Cook\n\nYes, it's a great question. We had an all-time revenue record in India. We grew very strong double digits. It's an incredibly exciting market for us and a major focus of ours. We have low share in a large market. And so it would seem that there's a lot of headroom there.\r\nThe ASPs, I haven't looked at them most recently but I'm sure that they're lower than the worldwide. But that doesn't bother us at all. It just -- and in terms of the similarity, I would say each country has its own journey and I wouldn't want to play the comparison game, but we see an extraordinary market, a lot of people moving into the middle class, distribution is getting better, lots of positives. We put 2 retail stores there, as you know. They're doing better than we anticipated. It's still early going but they're off to a good start. And I couldn't be happier with how things are going at the moment.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Ben Reitzes with Melius Research.\n\nBenjamin Alexander Reitzes\n\nTim, I appreciate all your commentary around China. It was great to kind of hear about the growth potential there or your optimism. I wanted to also ask about the supply chain. And where is your priority -- do you have a priority to diversify your supply chain? How do you feel about Apple's supply chain around the world? And in particular, what do you think about further investments in the U.S. as well?\n\nTimothy D. Cook\n\nOur supply chain is truly global, and so we're investing all over the world, including in the United States. We were very focused on advanced manufacturing for the U.S. and have worked on a number of different projects in the U.S., whether it's our venture with Corning on the glass or the Face ID module or semiconductors. And so all of these are advanced manufacturing, and I think exactly the kinds of things that the U.S. would be and are very, very good at.\r\nWe also invest in other regions of the world and we're continually optimizing the chain. And so we -- the moment we learn something that didn't work exactly right, we are tweaking it. And so we're going to continue to do that. But at the end of the day, it will still be a global supply chain.\n\nBenjamin Alexander Reitzes\n\nGot it. Next one for Luca. Just really quick on the extra week dynamic. There was also, last year, an issue with the iPhone production, where there was the COVID lockdowns in China. Is it possible to give some color around what that -- I guess, having a normalized supply chain somewhat this year, what that benefit is this year and maybe contrast that with the 7-point hit from the extra week?\n\nLuca Maestri\n\nYes. Thanks for the question, Ben. I mentioned during the prepared remarks, the extra week is 7 points of revenue. We did have disruptions, supply disruptions last year on the phone, on the 14 Pro and Pro Max in the December quarter a year ago. And when we normalize for those 2 factors, I said it during the call, we still expect to grow on iPhone. So you take into account the loss of the extra week, you compare it with the supply disruptions that are not going to repeat hopefully this year. And when you normalize for those 2 things, we still expect to grow on iPhone.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nAnd we'll take the last question now.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question comes from Richard Kramer with Arete Research.\n\nRichard Alan Kramer\n\nTim, first off, if we look over the past 2 years, Apple's sales are about $18 billion higher and R&D is up by about 8% -- $8 billion or over 1/3 higher. Can you give us a sense of some of the main components or drivers behind that increase in innovation spend? Is it Apple silicon? Is it new products like Vision Pro or is it content to support new services? I think that's one of the top questions investors have.\n\nTimothy D. Cook\n\nSure. It's a number of things, Richard. It's the -- some things I can't talk about. It's Vision Pro. It's AI and ML. It's the silicon investment that we're making, the transition with the Mac and other silicon. It's sort of all of those things. But I think you would find that the R&D expenditure in the aggregate looks very competitive versus others.\n\nLuca Maestri\n\nAnd I would add, Richard, on this front, some of the investments that we're making in R&D are also one of the drivers for the gross margin expansion. So I think it's important to think about it that way.\n\nRichard Alan Kramer\n\nThat's great. And Luca, you mentioned, or Tim mentioned college students choosing Macs and you mentioned the record Services revenue. What other metrics do you think you could provide to help investors understand how Apple measures and increases customer lifetime value, especially when we see a lot of users entering the ecosystem with relatively lower-priced products or even refurbished devices? So you're growing your ecosystem but how do you think about growing customer lifetime value over the long run?\n\nLuca Maestri\n\nWell, some of the metrics that I've mentioned before, obviously, we look at the installed base of active devices. We see -- we want to make sure that the customers that we acquire remain with us, and so we have good visibility over that, and we pay a lot of attention to the behavior of the installed base, both by product and by geography. And then we look at the daily engagement in the ecosystem.\r\nSo that's why we pay a lot of attention on things like transacting accounts, paid accounts. We want to see if, in fact, we are able to move our customers from a free model to a paid model over time. That's obviously very, very important for us. And so there's obvious -- we keep track of all these things. And that's -- and then what we do because I think it's really important is that over time, we add new services, and that, obviously -- like for example, the progress that we made in payments in recent years, very, very important because we've attracted more and more people that are actually now using additional features on our devices, and we are able to monetize that, right?\r\nSo we take all that into account. We understand what happens when a customer joins us, when they buy a primary device versus a used device. We understand the behavior in different markets and so on. So we have, I think, pretty good visibility. And I think the progress that we're making in Services, we did $85 billion in the last 12 months. That's the size of a Fortune 50 and significantly bigger than it was just a couple of years ago.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nThank you, Richard.

A key factor that separates evergreen businesses from others is necessity versus luxury. The latter will have volatile demand depending on the economic scenario. The manufacturers of necessity have a relatively stable cash flow profile. Of course, this is not the only screener. In a world dominated by technology, there can be necessities that are not so obvious like food and water.\n\nInvesting in growth stocks is important to ensure that portfolio returns swell. However, I would invest 30% to 50% of the portfolio in evergreen stocks for long-term wealth generation. This can be in the form of dividends, share repurchases, and capital gains.\n\nLet\u2019s discuss seven stocks to buy for long-term wealth creation.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nStocks to Buy for Long-Term Wealth: Newmont (NEM) Newmont logo on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat/Shutterstock\n\nIn a global scenario where inflation, geopolitical tensions, and swelling government debt are concerns, gold is likely to trend higher. The precious metal recently traded above $2,000 an ounce and I\u2019m bullish on upside. A good proxy for investing in gold is exposure to gold mining stocks. Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) stock is among the best mining stocks that trades at attractive valuations and offers a dividend yield of 4.27%.\n\nThe first reason to like Newmont is an investment grade balance sheet. As of Q2 2023, Newmont reported a liquidity buffer of $6.2 billion. Further, with net-debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA of 0.7, the Company has high financial flexibility for organic and acquisition driven growth.\n\nThe second reason to like the Company is high-quality assets. Even if we leave aside the recent acquisition of Newcrest Mining (OTCMKTS:NCMGF), the Company has quality tier one assets. There is clear production visibility into the 2040s and this implies sustained cash flow upside.\n\nCostco Wholesale (COST) A Costco Wholesale (COST) warehouse in Auburn Hills, Michigan.\n\nSource: ilzesgimene / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nThe largest growth driver for the U.S. economy is consumption spending. Within this, retail expenditure is a critical component. I would therefore remain invested in quality retail stocks. Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) is possibly the best bet.\n\nAmidst macroeconomic challenges, COST stock has trended higher by 22% for year-to-date. Further, the stock provides a dividend yield of 0.74% and I see visibility for sustained dividend growth.\n\nAn important point to note is that Costco has 861 warehouses globally. However, it\u2019s largely concentrated in U.S. and Canada. Currently, the Company is generating $4.6 billion in membership fee with a 92.7% renewal rate in U.S. and Canada. The number of warehouses in China currently stands at five. I expect significant expansion in China in the coming years, which will boost recurring membership fee.\n\nLeaving aside this factor, Costco continues to report healthy comparable store sales growth. For October, comparable sales increased by 3% on a year-on-year basis. With strong omni-channel sales presence, Costco is well positioned to benefit.\n\nChevron (CVX) Chevron (CVX) logo on gas station sign with \"diesel\" and \"food mart\" written underneath\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nOil and gas stocks are cyclical in nature and investors would question the reason for including Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) here. I would point out that Chevron managed to generate positive cash flows even during the pandemic year when oil plunged to historic lows.\n\nChevron has high quality assets that have a low break-even. Last year, Brent oil averaged $100.93 per barrel and Chevron delivered operating cash flow of $47.5 billion. With an investment grade balance sheet and robust cash flows, Chevron is positioned to create value.\n\nRecently, Chevron announced the acquisition of Hess Corporation (NYSE:HES) for a consideration of $53 billion. Post this acquisition, the Company will be investing $19 to $22 billion annually. This will ensure healthy reserve replacement and steady production growth.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that Chevron has already announced an 8% increase in quarterly dividend per share to $1.63. Given the high geopolitical tensions, I expect oil to trade above $80 per barrel. Dividend growth visibility therefore remains robust for the coming years.\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT) Close top view of a Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35C Lightning II with afterburner on\n\nSource: ranchorunner / Shutterstock.com\n\nLockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) stock is another name among stocks to buy for long-term wealth. When talking about the defense sector, I must remind investors that global defense spending increased even during the pandemic year. With rise in geopolitical tensions, I expect defense spending growth to accelerate further. Lockheed is well positioned to benefit and create value.\n\nTalking about fundamentals, Lockheed reported an order backlog of $156 billion as of Q3 2023. The order intake has been robust and as the backlog increases, revenue growth can potentially accelerate. At the same time, free cash flows will swell and translate into higher dividends. For the current year, Lockheed has guided for FCF of $6.2 billion.\n\nAs a part of the growth strategy, Lockheed is looking at expanding international collaborations. Orders from NATO member states will ensure growth. Further, the Company is investing in next-generation technology that includes hypersonic aircraft, among others. These factors will ensure that Lockheed remains a value creator.\n\nAstraZeneca (AZN) Exterior of the AstraZeneca's manufacturing facility at Snackviken\n\nSource: Roland Magnusson / Shutterstock.com\n\nAstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) stock has been largely sideways in the last 12 months. This does not come as a surprise with biopharmaceutical companies being dumped by investors in a post-pandemic world.\n\nHowever, this sell-off presents a golden opportunity to accumulate as top biopharma companies represent more than just growth from the covid-19 vaccine. There are multiple medical conditions of global concern with a big addressable market.\n\nAZN stock trades at an attractive forward price-earnings ratio of 17.4 and offers a dividend yield of 1.47%. Coming to the business, AstraZeneca currently has 172 projects in its research pipeline. Further, 14 molecular entities are in the late-stage pipeline. This will ensure steady revenue growth in the coming years.\n\nAnother point to note is that the company believes that there are ten potential blockbuster opportunities from 30 Phase III trials planned in 2023. Clearly, the pipeline is attractive and makes a strong case for investing in AZN stock.\n\nI also like the fact that the company is well diversified globally. For the first half of 2023, the Company reported 40% of revenue from outside the U.S. and Europe. Strong presence in emerging economies is likely to be a major growth catalyst.\n\nApple (AAPL) An image of a building with the Apple logo on it, a pink sunset in the background\n\nSource: askarim / Shutterstock\n\nFor years, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock has been a value creator. The reasons being the brand positioning and innovation. The same factors will continue to ensure that AAPL stock creates wealth in the long-term. In my view, AAPL stock is among the best dividend growth stocks to consider. My point is underscored by the Company\u2019s cash flow potential.\n\nHowever, that\u2019s not the only reason to be bullish on Apple. In the last quarter, Apple reported record revenue from the services segment. Further, the wearables business has ample headroom for growth globally. Apple will also be investing $1 billion annually towards artificial intelligence devices. There continues to be speculation about Apple\u2019s electric car that seems to be scheduled for launch in 2026.\n\nTherefore, there is a strong case for diversification driven growth. I must add that Apple is also focusing on markets like India and Southeast Asia. Emerging markets (excluding China) have the potential to accelerate revenue growth.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) supercharging station during the day.\n\nSource: Arina P Habich / Shutterstock.com\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) was a hated stock among lot of analysts since listing. However, the Company navigated an extended period of cash burn and created immense value. With positive tailwinds for electric vehicles likely to last beyond the decade, I remain bullish on TSLA stock.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Tesla has set an ambitious target of producing 20 million electric vehicles annually by 2030. To achieve this target, the Company is likely to invest in few more factories in the coming years. India and Indonesia are some potential locations in emerging markets.\n\nI also like the fact that Tesla currently has an attractive product line-up. Cybertruck, Roadster, and Tesla Semi will ensure that deliveries growth is healthy. Further, the launch of Tesla Semi would mark the Company\u2019s entry into commercial EVs.\n\nFrom a financial perspective, Tesla reported operating cash flow of $8.9 billion for the first nine months of 2023. Further, the Company has $26 billion in cash and equivalents. This provides high financial flexibility to make aggressive investments for growth.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The tech giant released four new phones in the iPhone 15 family in September, including models that featured titanium cases and better cameras.\n\nBut sales have now been declining for 12 months and the company is in its longest slump since 2001.\n\nThe company\u2019s business in China, its third largest market, shrank 2.5% to $15.1bn as Beijing faces a broad economic slowdown.\n\nRead more: My first boss: Nick Ogden, the \u2018founding father of fintech\u2019\n\nRevenues in its Mac, iPad, and Wearables categories fell from the same quarter last year. For its just-completed fiscal year, Apple reported total revenue of $383.3bn, down from $394.3bn in the prior year.\n\nHere are some of the highlights from Apple's quarter, compared to Wall Street expectations compiled by Bloomberg:\n\nRevenue: $89.5bn versus $89.34bn expected ($90.15bn in Q4 2022) Adj. EPS: $1.46 versus $1.39 expected ($1.29 in Q4 2022) iPhone revenue: $43.8bn versus $43.73bn expected ($42.63bn in Q4 2022) Services revenue: $22.3bn versus $21.36bn expected ($19.19bn in Q4 2022) Mac revenue: $7.6bn versus $8.76bn expected ($11.51bn in Q4 2022) iPad revenue: $6.4bn versus $6.33bn expected ($7.22bn in Q4 2022) Wearables revenue: $9.3bn versus $9.41bn expected ($9.65bn in Q4 2022)\n\nOn a call with analysts following the results, Apple CFO Luca Maestri said revenue in the current quarter to be \"similar\" to last year. Maestri also said the company is expecting revenue for Mac, iPad, and Wearables categories to \"decelerate significantly\" from the fourth quarter.\n\nMaersk (AMKBY)\n\nShares in one of the world\u2019s biggest shipping companies tanked in pre-trading after it announced it will cut 10,000 jobs.\n\nStory continues\n\nAP Moller-Maersk reported a drop $10.6bn (\u00a38.7bn) in revenues across the third quarter as underlying pre-tax profits plunged 82% to $1.9bn amid \u201csubstantially lower freight rates\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf you want an economic bellwether, look no further than Maersk, as its status as one of the world\u2019s largest container shipping companies makes it a fair proxy for global growth,\u201d said AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould.\n\n\u201cTransportation demand will be strong if the economy is going well, but the opposite will apply if there are clouds on the horizon.

It\u2019s also the biggest underperformer in that group, and there are signs Wall Street\u2019s excitement is fading.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nSam Bankman-Fried Convicted of Fraud in Stunning FTX Crash Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos Announces Move to Miami From Seattle Hedge Fund Executive\u2019s Sudden Death Exposes a Firm Deep in Trouble Intuit Is Closing Personal-Finance App Mint, Shifts Users to Credit Karma Harvard, Yale Warned by Top Law Firms About Antisemitism\n\nThe EV behemoth stands out as the only one of the seven biggest companies in the S&P 500 Index \u2014 a group that also includes Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp., Apple Inc., Alphabet Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Nvidia Corp. \u2014 whose estimated profit for 2024 has declined significantly from where it was a year ago.\n\nTesla shares have been the worst performer in the group by a significant margin, since the third-quarter earnings season kicked off in mid-October. The stock sank fast after the company\u2019s chief executive officer Elon Musk dialed back growth expectations amid slowing demand and dour forecasts from other automakers.\n\nFor the most recognizable EV brand and the largest pure-play EV-maker globally, the slowdown means further scrutiny on Tesla\u2019s premium market valuation of about $690 billion \u2014 a level that leaves little room for error. Its share of bullish ratings is at the lowest since April 2021, reflecting growing skepticism.\n\n\u201cThe outlook for EV demand is a big problem for Tesla,\u201d said Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak + Co. \u201cTheir continued price cuts are taking their toll, so lower demand is only going to exacerbate this issue.\u201d\n\nShares of the company trade at 56 times their forward earnings, compared with the mid-single-digit multiples of legacy auto companies General Motors Co. and Ford Motor Co., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. More importantly, Tesla\u2019s price-to-earnings ratio is significantly higher than that of even its other mega-cap counterparts.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts on average now expect Tesla\u2019s 2024 earnings to be about 40% lower than what they were estimating 12 months ago, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. For the other six, the estimates have either risen over the same period or fallen very slightly.\n\nBullish investors on Tesla are \u201cstill looking out to mid-decade and not the current demand environment,\u201d to focus on the next car, the self-driving technology and the humanoid robot Optimus among others, Cowen & Co. analyst Jeffrey Osborne said in an interview. He added that valuing such longer-term potentials are challenging given the current economic uncertainty.\n\n\u201cI have a hard time being bullish on things beyond cars, especially technologies that don\u2019t work yet and may never work, particularly the full-self-driving software,\u201d Osborne added.\n\nThe cornerstone of Tesla\u2019s valuation remains the EV business, where risks have been climbing fast. Rising interest rates have driven up car-ownership costs, squeezing consumers at a time of high inflation, and EVs being a new technology are suffering the most. Musk\u2019s aggressive push to lower the price of Tesla\u2019s cars hasn\u2019t been seen to significantly boost demand.\n\nTesla\u2019s lower-than-expected 2024 growth trajectory could be due to that broader slowdown in adoption, Deutsche Bank analysts Tim Rokossa and Emmanuel Rosner wrote in a recent note. The second wave of EV consumers may require a much cheaper starting price, and could be waiting for larger infrastructure \u2014 such as a charging network \u2014 to be built out.\n\n\u201cAlthough US consumers will start benefiting from $7,500 in EV incentive credit at point of sale as of Jan. 1, we fear that this alone might not be sufficient to accelerate the demand curve in the US in the near term, especially given in a record high interest rate environment,\u201d the analysts wrote in a client note on Tuesday.\n\nDespite that, believers in Tesla are keeping their faith in EVs\u2019 longer-term potential, since most experts and analysts see electric cars as the future of the auto industry. And while competition to dominate that market will be intense, these investors are betting on Musk\u2019s ability to keep the company ahead of the rest.\n\n\u201cEVs have some big problems, but Tesla is way beyond just an EV company because of Elon Musk,\u201d said Matthew Tuttle, chief investment officer and CEO at Tuttle Capital Management. \u201cElon allows for a higher multiple than you would have if Tesla was just an EV company.\u201d\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nApple shares slipped 3.3% in premarket trading on Friday, on course to erase more than $90 billion from its market value, after the iPhone maker reported its fourth-quarter results. If losses hold, Apple would have a market cap of about $2.68 trillion \u2014 putting Microsoft Corp about $80 billion away from re-gaining the title of the world\u2019s most valuable company, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nApple Inc.\u2019s disappointing holiday-quarter outlook has cast a spotlight on its mounting problems in China, where the iPhone maker is struggling with the unexpected rise of Huawei Technologies Co. and an increasingly hostile business environment. Sam Bankman-Fried was convicted of a massive fraud that led to the collapse of his FTX exchange, following a month-long trial that pitted the testimony of the former crypto king against that of some of his closest friends. Amazon.com Inc. founder Jeff Bezos said he was moving to Miami from the Seattle region, relocating to be closer to his parents and the Cape Canaveral operations of Blue Origin LLC, his space exploration company. Chinese electric truck maker Windrose Technology Inc. has started preparatory work for an initial public offering in the US next year as it plans the commercial roll out of its first vehicle. Nio Inc. said it is cutting jobs and and may spin off non-core businesses to reduce costs and improve efficiency, as the Chinese electric-vehicle maker falls way short of its sales targets and continues to post losses.\n\nEarnings Due Friday\n\nPremarket\n\nGartner Telus Liberty Broadband U.S. Cellular Telephone and Data Systems Inc Cinemark Shenandoah Telecom fuboTV AMC Networks\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe US Housing Market Has Become an Impossible Mess These Five Countries Are Key Economic \u2018Connectors\u2019 in a Fragmenting World World\u2019s Safest Market Becomes a Magnet for Big Investors Shipping Startup Flexport Is in Crisis Mode Heading Into the Holiday Season Foxconn Makes Your iPhone.

Its shares have rallied nearly 40% this year.\n\nThe iPhone maker on Thursday predicted quarterly sales that were below market estimates, blaming weak demand for iPads and wearables, especially in key market China.\n\nThe projection fanned fears about broader holiday demand, with estimates including those from the U.S. National Retail Federation and Deloitte predicting the slowest rise in sales in the crucial shopping period in years due to sticky inflation.\n\n\"Apple's revenue growth has stalled over the past few quarters - and appears likely to continue to stagnate over the next year,\" said brokerage Bernstein, noting the holiday quarter usually sets the tone for Apple's fiscal year that runs until September.\n\nAt least 11 analysts cut their price targets on the stock, pushing down the median price target to $196.5, according to LSEG data.

Its shares slid more than 3% after that number missed the average of five analysts\u2019 projections by 11%. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook assured Wall Street that iPhone demand remains strong in China, blaming Mac and iPad weakness instead. But he also predicted flat December-quarter revenue, suggesting Wall Street won\u2019t see the growth rebound it\u2019s banking on.\n\nInvestors have grown skittish about the iPhone\u2019s prospects in China, which accounts for about a fifth of Apple sales and hosts its biggest production base. The country\u2019s consumer economy is reeling, while US businesses face increasing pressure from Beijing as a technology conflict with the US rages. Huawei\u2019s surprise August debut of a smartphone with an advanced made-in-China 5G processor also tapped a vein of patriotism that\u2019s taken sales away from the iPhone.\n\n\u201cThe challenges that Apple faces in China are unprecedented,\u201d IDC analyst Will Wong said after the results. \u201cIt not only needs to deal with the political tensions and Huawei\u2019s competition but also a different consumer sentiment that is more rational and cautious in spending.\u201d\n\nApple\u2019s revenue in Greater China declined 2% \u2014 a steeper drop than the companywide figure. There are signs that trend may persist: Initial sales of the iPhone 15 in China were 6% lower than its predecessor in part because of incursions by Huawei, according to the consultancy GfK.\n\nStory continues\n\nAside from stronger competition, Apple faces growing risk from political tensions between Washington and Beijing.\n\nBeijing has expanded a ban on Apple products to state-backed firms and government-backed agencies. Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. \u2014 which assembles the majority of Apple\u2019s iPhones from its Chinese factories \u2014 is now under investigation over taxes and land use. Hon Hai, the listed arm of Foxconn Technology Group, and fellow iPhone assembler Pegatron Corp. fell in Taipei on Friday.\n\nStill, Cook said the iPhone continues to make inroads in the world\u2019s biggest smartphone market. Various models accounted for the four top-selling phones in urban China, he said.\n\n\u201cChina is an incredibly important market,\u201d the CEO said during a post-earnings conference call with analysts. \u201cAnd I\u2019m very optimistic about it.\u201d He didn\u2019t face any direct questions about the situation.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\n\nApple\u2019s conference call did little to ease fears about a potential slowdown of product sales in China, which were notably below consensus at $15 billion, down 2.5% vs. last year, compared with expectations of a 10% increase. Services growth of 16% was the biggest positive surprise, helping to counter weak sales in China, and could be in double digits again in fiscal 1Q. Overall, these results and the 1Q outlook lead us to believe that fiscal 2024 sales growth will likely be about 2% lower than consensus of 5.6%.\n\n- Anurag Rana and Andrew Girard, BI analysts\n\nClick here for the full research\n\nThe iPhone 15 went on sale on Sept. 22 \u2014 only about a week before the quarter ended \u2014 so the latest results only provide an early sense of how the device is doing. Investors will get a clearer picture when Apple reports its holiday results early next year.\n\nIf the overall China smartphone market is contracting \u2014 as analysts have said \u2014 Apple\u2019s results suggest that it\u2019s winning market share, Cook said. He also touted that the company is opening a new store in the country this week. It\u2019s coming to Wenzhou in eastern Zhejiang province and will be the company\u2019s 46th in the region.\n\nCook was in China last month and said he \u201ccouldn\u2019t be more excited\u201d about the interactions he had with customers and employees, reiterating Apple\u2019s commitment to manufacturing in the country. Beijing announced its investigation into Foxconn about a week after.\n\n(Updates with analyst comment)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe US Housing Market Has Become an Impossible Mess World\u2019s Safest Market Becomes a Magnet for Big Investors These Five Countries Are Key Economic \u2018Connectors\u2019 in a Fragmenting World Shipping Startup Flexport Is in Crisis Mode Heading Into the Holiday Season Foxconn Makes Your iPhone.

Elsewhere, FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried is convicted of stealing billions of dollars from customers, capping a shocking fall from grace for the man who was once considered to be the face of the crypto industry.\n\n1. Futures mixed ahead of fresh jobs report\n\nU.S. stock futures were mixed on Friday as investors awaited the release of a closely-watched labor market report and digested earnings from Apple.\n\nBy 05:56 ET (09:56 GMT), the Dow futures contract was mostly unchanged, S&P 500 futures dipped by 8 points or 0.2%, and Nasdaq 100 futures lost 54 points or 0.4%.\n\nThe main indices on Wall Street are coming off of strong gains in the prior session that were fueled by the Federal Reserve's decision to leave interest rates unchanged for a second straight meeting on Wednesday. Similar moves by policymakers at the Bank of England and in Norway also buoyed renewed hopes that an era of unprecedented monetary tightening may be coming to an end, providing a further lift to equities.\n\nThe 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1.7%, while the benchmark S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite jumped by 1.9% and 1.8%, respectively.\n\nAmerican government bonds, which have been hit in recent weeks by a prolonged sell-off, also rallied, with the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield seeing its biggest two-day fall since a banking sector crisis in March. Prices typically rise as yields decline.\n\n2. Payrolls data looms\n\nAttention now turns to the publication of the key nonfarm payrolls data for October due later in the day.\n\nEconomists predict that the U.S. economy added 180,000 jobs last month, down from 336,000 in September. The unemployment rate is seen at 3.8%, matching the prior month's figure, while average hourly earnings are expected to have increased by 0.3% month-on-month in October, following a 0.2% gain in September.\n\nStory continues\n\nTraders will likely be on the lookout for any signs of resilience in the labor market, a trend that could give the Fed more headroom to hike interest rates once again.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference on Wednesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell left open the possibility for additional policy increases, but stressed that officials will proceed carefully in response to a host of uncertainties facing the U.S. economy.\n\n3. Apple fails to assuage outlook worries\n\nShares in Apple dipped in premarket U.S. trading, as concerns remained around the tech giant's projections for its current three-month period.\n\nThe California company flagged that revenue in its December quarter -- typically one of its largest due to holiday shopping -- would be in line with the corresponding time frame last year. However, the quarter will be one week shorter, denting sales by 7%.\n\nIn the September quarter, revenue at Apple's key Chinese market dropped by 2.5%, exacerbating worries over the impact of intensifying competition and geopolitical tensions. Rival Huawei released a new high-end smartphone during the period and China reportedly ordered government employees not to use Apple's flagship iPhone device.\n\nBut Apple executives maintained that the firm still gained market share in China, with Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri telling the Wall Street Journal that the four best-selling phones in the country were iPhones.\n\nOverall sales in Apple's fiscal fourth-quarter dipped by a little under 1% to $89.5 billion. The figure marked the fourth consecutive quarterly decline, although it topped estimates of $89.31B. Earnings per share of $1.46 also beat expectations.\n\n4. Sam Bankman-Fried convicted\n\nSam Bankman-Fried, the founder of cryptocurrency exchange FTX, was found guilty of stealing billions of dollars from customers by a jury in New York on Thursday.\n\nThe decision, which came after just five hours of juror deliberation, means that 31-year old Bankman-Fried -- once considered to be an icon in the crypto industry -- may be sentenced to decades in prison. He had faced seven charges, including wire fraud and money laundering.\n\nHis sentencing date was set for March 28, 2024.\n\nSpeaking after the verdict, victorious U.S. prosecutors said that Bankman-Fried's fraud aimed to position him as the \"king of crypto.\" They added that despite the relative youth of the crypto industry, \"this kind of corruption is as old as time.\"\n\nBankman-Fried's lawyer noted that while he respects the jury's decision, he will continue to \"vigorously\" fight the charges.\n\n5. Crude on course for losing week\n\nOil prices on Friday were on course for their second consecutive losing week, despite posting sharp gains in the previous session after traders became increasingly confident that the Fed was done with its run of interest rate hikes.\n\nBy 05:56 ET, the U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% lower at $82.36 a barrel, while the Brent contract slipped by 0.2% to $86.72 per barrel.\n\nThe benchmarks gained more than $2 a barrel on Thursday. However, both were set to shed more than 3% for the week, as a lack of escalation in the Israel-Hamas war eased worries about disruptions to supply in this oil-rich region. Meanwhile, recent data out of China has underscored an uncertain demand outlook in the world's top oil importer.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nPayrolls report ahead, Apple earnings - what's moving markets\n\nEvents leading up to FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried's conviction\n\nGoldman Sachs shifts bond recommendation to neutral amid subsiding inflation", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/payrolls-report-ahead-apple-earnings-060419876.html", "symbols": ["AAPL.US", "DJI.INDX", "IXIC.INDX"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": -0.995, "neg": 0.113, "neu": 0.824, "pos": 0.063}}, {"date": "2023-11-03T04:40:49+00:00", "title": "European stocks higher; SocGen gains ahead of key U.S. payrolls release", "content": "Investing.com - European stock markets traded higher Friday, continuing the previous session\u2019s positive tone on optimism around peak global rates, although focus was on key U.S. payrolls data later in the day.\n\nAt 04:35 ET (08:35 GMT), the DAX index in Germany traded 0.3% higher and the CAC 40 in France climbed 0.3% and the FTSE 100 in the U.K. rose 0.4%.\n\nPeak global rates?\n\nEuropean equities are having a strong week, following the lead from Wall Street, boosted by retreating global yields, surprisingly healthy corporate earnings and, most importantly, optimism that a number of senior central banks have concluded their rate-hiking cycles.\n\nThe Federal Reserve held interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, followed by the Bank of England on Thursday, while the European Central Bank had done the same last week.\n\nThe German DAX is on course to post gains of 3.1% for the week, the CAC 40 in Paris gains of 3.9% and the FTSE 100 in the U.K. is currently 2.1% higher.\n\nU.S. jobs report in spotlight\n\nThis optimism, however, could be punctured by a stronger than expected official U.S. jobs report later in the session, as this will be one of the data sets the Fed looks at when deciding its next step.\n\nAnalysts expect to see the U.S. economy added 180,000 jobs in October, down from September's 336,000.

However, its sales forecast for the holiday quarter disappointed, hurt by weak demand for iPads.\n\nCrude heading for hefty weekly losses\n\nOil prices edged higher Friday, adding to the previous session\u2019s sharp gains after traders became increasingly confident that the Federal Reserve was done with its run of interest rate hikes, hitting the dollar.\n\nBy 04:35 ET, the U.S. crude futures traded 0.6% higher at $82.98 a barrel, while the Brent contract climbed 0.4% to $87.22 a barrel. Both benchmarks gained more than $2 a barrel on Thursday.\n\nHowever, both crude contracts were set to lose more than 3% for the week, their second consecutive losing week, as a lack of escalation in the Israel-Hamas war removed worries about disruptions to supply in this oil-rich region.\n\nAdditionally, gold futures rose 0.1% to $1,995.25/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.0625.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nEuropean stocks higher; SocGen gains ahead of key U.S. payrolls release\n\nCoinbase falls 5% on falling trading volumes; Analysts remain cautious on stock\n\nRestaurant Brands misses sales estimates on weaker Burger King demand", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/european-stocks-higher-socgen-gains-044049182.html", "symbols": ["AAPL.MX", "AAPL.US", "AAPL34.SA", "APC.F", "APC.XETRA", "FCHI.INDX", "FTSE.INDX", "GDAXI.INDX"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": -0.977, "neg": 0.116, "neu": 0.797, "pos": 0.087}}, {"date": "2023-11-03T03:58:52+00:00", "title": "UPDATE 1-China iPhone sales strong, Apple tells investors as Huawei threat looms", "content": "(adds background on discounts in China, analyst quote)\n\nBy Yuvraj Malik and Stephen Nellis\n\nNov 2 (Reuters) - Apple said on Thursday that demand for its iPhones in China was strong, trying to reassure investors who are worried it is losing ground to a newly resurgent Huawei Technologies and other local smartphone makers.\n\n\"In mainland China, we set a quarterly record for the September quarter for iPhone,\" Chief Executive Tim Cook told Reuters in an interview. \"We had four out of the top five best-selling smartphones in urban China.\"\n\nApple appeared to have gained market share in China in the July-September period, even if the overall smartphone market may have contracted, he said on a conference call with analysts.\n\nThe company expects to sell more iPhones in the holiday quarter despite this year's quarter having one fewer week of sales than the prior year's, Cook said.\n\nResearch firm Canalys estimated that overall smartphone sales in China fell 3% in July-September from a year earlier as consumers bought fewer smartphones as an economic recovery was choppy.\n\nThat was slower pace of decline than previous quarters, a sign that a slump in the market had eased.

Its valuation needs to increase by 132% to join the club.\n\nTSM is the world\u2019s biggest chipmaker. In late October, founder Morris Chang said increasing tensions between China and the U.S. over technology issues would hold the semiconductor industry back.\n\n\u201cI think that decoupling will ultimately slow down everybody. Of course, the immediate purpose is to slow China down, and I think it\u2019s doing that,\u201d noted Reuters. It reported Chang\u2019s comments about the U.S. banning the export of certain chips and chipmaking tools to China.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor is investing $40 billion to build a chip fabrication facility in Arizona. Last December, it announced it would triple its investment in the plant. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang called the investment a \u201cgame-changing development for the industry\u201d.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile the company\u2019s revenues are expected to fall by 10% in 2023, given the demand for artificial intelligence (AI), the long-term future remains optimistic.\n\nAdobe (ADBE) Adobe logo on wall of corporate building.\n\nSource: r.classen / Shutterstock.com\n\nAdobe (NASDAQ:ADBE)vhas a market cap of $248 billion. Its shares have increased by nearly 62% this year. ADBE stock must stay in motion for the next 24-36 months to get to $1 trillion.\n\nInvestorPlace contributor Jeremy Flint recently called Adobe a machine learning stock that will make investors rich. The software company for creatives has used machine learning in its products for more than a decade. Therefore, Flint believes this makes it eminently qualified to incorporate AI and machine learning tools into its products.\n\nIn November 2018, I suggested investors buy ADBE stock on the dip from its September highs. From January 2019 through November 2021, its shares rose 211%. Despite the drop in 2022, they\u2019re still up 122% from November 2018.\n\nIts share price could land at or past $700 by this time next year. Of course, anything but a mild recession would put that on hold for a while.\n\nOf the 36 analysts covering its stock, 25 rate it overweight or an outright buy, with a $620 target price, 13% higher than where it\u2019s currently trading.\n\nAbbVie (ABBV) Closeup of AbbVie (ABBV) building corporate office, an American biopharmaceutical company with its headquarters in Lake Bluff, Illinois, USA\n\nSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com\n\nAbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) is best known as the company behind the immunology drug Humira, which treats moderate to severe cases of rheumatoid arthritis. However, some of its newer and developing products will get it to the $1 trillion mark.\n\nAbbVie reported Q3 2023 results on Oct. 27., better than expected. Revenue came in at $13.93 billion and earnings per share were $2.95. The top line beat analyst expectations by $210 million, while bottom-line earnings were eight cents ahead of the consensus estimate.\n\nHowever, its revenue and EPS were lower than a year ago, down 5.9% and 19.3%, respectively. Also, Humira saw its global sales decline by a whopping 36%.\n\nHowever, Skyrizi and Rinvoq, its other two big immunology drugs, saw revenues increase by 52% and 59% in the third quarter. Combined quarterly sales were just $311 million shy of matching Humira\u2019s quarterly revenue.\n\nPerhaps the best example of using what you\u2019ve got in new and improved ways is Botox, which it inherited in its May 2020 acquisition of Allergan. Created as a cosmetic treatment for wrinkles, it is used as a therapeutic for treating migraines and muscle pain. In Q3, Botox Therapeutic revenues were $748 million, 7.4% higher than a year ago.\n\nFurther, yielding 4.4%, it\u2019s an attractive buy for dividend lovers right now.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

But when it comes to answering questions about Apple's generative AI efforts, CEO Tim Cook's comments are ready for mass production.\n\nCook has uttered nearly the exact same words about the company\u2019s AI strategy in recent earnings calls, at times sounding like he\u2019s reading from the same script.\n\nDuring Thursday\u2019s call with analysts following Apple\u2019s fiscal fourth quarter earnings report, Cook began by noting Apple's long track record in artificial intelligence:\n\n\u201cWe view AI and machine learning as fundamental technologies, and they\u2019re integral to virtually every product that we show,\u201d Cook said before ticking off a list of AI features already in Apple products including crash detection, fall detection, and the ECG feature in the Apple Watch.\n\nIf that sounds familiar, you were probably tuned in to Apple's fiscal third quarter call in August:\n\n\u201cWe view AI and machine learning as core fundamental technologies that are integral to virtually every product that we build,\" Cook said then, with only three words difference from Thursday's comments. He also then listed fall detection, crash detection and the Watch ECG feature.\n\nChief executives often repeat themselves over the course of earnings calls, if for no other reason than to drive certain points home to analysts who appraise their companies and recommend actions to investors. And Apple is famous for keeping mum about its future product plans.\n\nApple reported its fourth consecutive quarterly revenue decline on Thursday, though iPhone sales increased. Shares of Apple were down roughly 3% in after hours trading.\n\nAnalysts are especially focused on how companies are integrating AI into their products and operations, and how it will impact their financial results. It has largely been the topic of conversation during many Big Tech earnings calls in recent months. During Microsoft\u2019s call last week, six of eight analysts that executives took questions from asked about AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nBloomberg's Apple reporter Mark Gurman has reported that the company is quietly building an \u201cApple GPT\u201d large language model that's similar to OpenAI's buzzy ChatGPT. While Apple has not confirmed that any such product is in the works, Cook noted on Thursday that \"in terms of generative AI, obviously we have work going on. I'm not going to get into details about what it is, because as you know we really don't do that.\"\n\n\u201cYou can bet that we\u2019re investing quite a bit, we\u2019re going to do it responsibly, and you will see product advancements over time,\u201d Cook continued on Thursday, after his pre-amble about Apple's AI track record. Once again, his response followed in the footsteps he set three months earlier in his answer to the generative AI question: \u201cWe're going to continue investing and innovating and responsibly advancing our products.\u201d\n\nAstute readers will notice that the generative AI \"investing\" that Cook referred to in August has now been upgraded to \"investing quite a bit.\" So perhaps Cook is changing the message.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tim-cook-keeps-giving-same-012555869.html", "symbols": ["AAPL.MX", "AAPL.US", "AAPL34.SA", "APC.F", "APC.XETRA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.92, "neg": 0.015, "neu": 0.942, "pos": 0.044}}, {"date": "2023-11-03T00:48:21+00:00", "title": "China iPhone sales strong, Apple tells investors as Huawei threat looms", "content": "By Yuvraj Malik and Stephen Nellis\n\n(Reuters) - Apple said on Thursday that demand for its iPhones in China was strong, trying to reassure investors who are worried it is losing ground to a newly resurgent Huawei Technologies and other local smartphone makers.\n\n\"In mainland China, we set a quarterly record for the September quarter for iPhone,\" Chief Executive Tim Cook told Reuters in an interview. \"We had four out of the top five best-selling smartphones in urban China.\"\n\nApple appeared to have gained market share in China in the July-September period, even if the overall smartphone market may have contracted, he said on a conference call with analysts.\n\nThe company expects to sell more iPhones in the holiday quarter despite this year's quarter having one fewer week of sales than the prior year's, Cook said.\n\nResearch firm Canalys estimated that overall smartphone sales in China fell 3% in July-September from a year earlier as consumers bought fewer smartphones as an economic recovery was choppy.\n\nThat was slower pace of decline than previous quarters, a sign that a slump in the market had eased.

The company also pointed to currency fluctuations, which reduced the value of money generated in the region.\n\nOverall revenue in greater China declined 2% from the year-earlier period \u2014 a steeper drop than Apple experienced companywide. And Apple shares declined more than 3% in late trading Thursday.\n\nBut the iPhone continued to make inroads in the market, Cook said. That included notching a revenue record for mainland China during the quarter. The various iPhone models account for the four top-selling phones in urban China, he said.\n\n\u201cChina is an incredibly important market,\u201d Cook said during a post-earnings conference call with analysts. \u201cAnd I\u2019m very optimistic about it.\u201d\n\nApple investors have grown skittish about the iPhone in China since the country widened bans of US technology in government workplaces. Shenzhen-based Huawei also just introduced a new model that is challenging the iPhone. And iPhone assembler Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. is under investigation by Chinese authorities on unspecified probes, casting another cloud over the business. On the call, Cook didn\u2019t face any direct questions from analysts about the situation.\n\nThe issues are central to Apple\u2019s business. The iPhone is its flagship product, generating roughly half its revenue, and China is its biggest international market. The country also still serves as Apple\u2019s manufacturing hub, even as the company shifts more production to India and other locations.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe iPhone 15 went on sale on Sept. 22 \u2014 only about a week before the quarter ended \u2014 so the latest results only provide an early sense of how the device is doing. Investors will get a clearer picture when Apple reports its holiday results early next year. On Thursday, Apple projected flat revenue overall for the December quarter \u2014 a sign potentially that the Chinese market remains a question mark.\n\nIf the overall China smartphone market is contracting \u2014 as analysts have said \u2014 Apple\u2019s results suggest that it\u2019s winning market share, Cook said. He also touted that the company is opening a new store in China this week. It\u2019s coming to Wenzhou in the Zhejiang province and will be the company\u2019s 46th in the region.\n\nThe Cupertino, California-based company added that its services business also enjoyed record sales in the region.\n\nCook was just in China last month and said he \u201ccouldn\u2019t be more excited\u201d about the interactions he had with customers and employees.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe US Housing Market Has Become an Impossible Mess World\u2019s Safest Market Becomes a Magnet for Big Investors These Five Countries Are Key Economic \u2018Connectors\u2019 in a Fragmenting World Shipping Startup Flexport Is in Crisis Mode Heading Into the Holiday Season Foxconn Makes Your iPhone.

But the fundamental technology behind it is AI and machine learning.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nHe also indicated the company is making significant investments in generative AI but opted against offering a preview of how that could be integrated into Apple\u2019s products.\n\n\"In terms of generative AI\u2026 obviously we have work going on and I\u2019m not going to get into details about what it is because as you know we really don\u2019t do that. But you can bet that we\u2019re investing, we\u2019re investing quite a bit, we are going to do it responsibly and you will see product advancements over time where those technologies are at the heart of it,\" Cook explained.\n\nReuters contributed to this report.\n\nOriginal article source:Apple shares slide as holiday forecast misses expectations", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-shares-slide-holiday-forecast-231953979.html", "symbols": ["AAPL.MX", "AAPL.US", "AAPL34.SA", "APC.F", "APC.XETRA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.987, "neg": 0.033, "neu": 0.871, "pos": 0.096}}, {"date": "2023-11-02T23:18:39+00:00", "title": "Apple Warns of Sluggish Holiday Quarter After China Slowdown", "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc., already facing a slowdown in China, warned that revenue in the holiday quarter will be about the same as last year, signaling that investors won\u2019t see the growth rebound they were banking on.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nIntuit Is Closing Personal-Finance App Mint, Shifts Users to Credit Karma S&P 500 Rises Almost 2%; Apple Down in Late Hours: Markets Wrap Immigrants Are Leaving Canada at Faster Pace, Study Shows Harvard, Yale Warned by Top Law Firms About Antisemitism Israel Latest: Troops Encircle Gaza City as Death Toll Climbs\n\nThough iPhone revenue is expected to increase in the December quarter, overall sales will be similar to the year-earlier period, Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said on a conference call Thursday following Apple\u2019s quarterly report. The tepid outlook sent the shares down as much as 4.6% in late trading.\n\nWall Street had projected revenue growth of about 5% in the quarter, which is invariably Apple\u2019s biggest sales period of the year. Revenue from the iPad and the company\u2019s wearables category, which includes its smartwatch line, will drop significantly during the quarter, Apple said. The Mac, on the other hand, will see an acceleration.\n\nThe company has been trying to pull out of its longest sales slowdown in decades. It just reported its fourth straight revenue decline, matching a streak it suffered in 2001, as the company struggles with a sluggish computer market and shaky demand in China.\n\nRevenue fell to $89.5 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter, which ended Sept. 30. That compared with an average Wall Street estimate of $89.4 billion. Apple didn\u2019t provide formal guidance for the current quarter, sticking with a policy it adopted during the pandemic.\n\nThe results suggest that Apple is facing a deceleration in China. The government there has imposed bans on US technology in some workplaces, and a new phone from Huawei Technologies Co. is providing fresh competition. Revenue from that region amounted to $15.1 billion last quarter, down slightly from a year earlier and well short of the $17 billion that some analysts had predicted. Cook said the decline was due to a drop in Mac and iPad sales, as well as currency fluctuations.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple shares dropped as low as $169.33 in extended trading. They had closed at $177.57 in New York, leaving them up 37% this year.\n\nThe company updated the iPhone, its flagship product, during the fourth quarter. The period included a little over a week of sales data following the device\u2019s launch on Sept. 22. The Cupertino, California-based company also released new watch models \u2014 the Series 9 and Ultra 2 \u2014 and updated its AirPods Pro to add a USB-C port.\n\nEven with the challenges, the iPhone performed slightly better than projected. It generated $43.8 billion in sales, compared with an average estimate of $43.7 billion. And, despite the concerns, the device reached a quarterly revenue record in mainland China, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said during the conference call with analysts. Earnings came in at $1.46 a share last quarter, topping the $1.39 forecast.\n\nCook also said the company was investing \u201cquite a bit\u201d in generative artificial intelligence. Bloomberg News recently reported that Apple is planning to inject the technology into several new apps and services next year. \u201cYou will see product advancements over time,\u201d Cook said, \u201cwhere those technologies are at the heart of them.\u201d\n\nThe iPhone accounts for roughly half of Apple\u2019s sales, so the launch of a new model is closely watched by investors. With the iPhone 15, the company redesigned the high-end versions \u2014 giving them titanium cases \u2014 and added features such as a more powerful zoom camera lens. The hope was to entice smartphone shoppers who had been holding onto their old models for longer these days.\n\nApple had a favorable year-over-year comparison this cycle because 2022\u2019s iPhone 14 Pro models faced supply constraints due to shutdowns at Apple\u2019s manufacturing partners in China. The iPhone 15 Pro had no such limitations.\n\nThursday\u2019s report follows an upbeat view from Qualcomm Inc., the leading maker of smartphone chips. On Wednesday, it forecast stronger sales for the current quarter than analysts expected, kicking off a rally for its stock.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says:\n\n\u201cThe sales miss in China is discouraging and could have been caused by soft consumer spending.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Anurag Rana, BI technology industry analyst\n\nClick here to read his research.\n\nIn one potentially ominous sign, Qualcomm said that its smartphone chip business saw a 35% increase from Chinese manufacturers of Android phones, suggesting that customers in the region are opting for non-iPhones in larger numbers.\n\nThe area is Apple\u2019s largest international market, accounting for about a fifth of sales. Still, Cook said he believes Apple actually gained smartphone market share in China during the quarter.\n\nThe company said that the iPhone set revenue records in several developed and emerging markets, including India.\n\nThe personal computer market also is poised for a resurgence, but Apple didn\u2019t debut any new models during the quarter. Though it unveiled new MacBook Pros, iMacs and M3 processors earlier this week, sales of those machines won\u2019t show up in Apple results until the quarter ending in December.\n\nApple brought in $7.61 billion from the Mac during the fourth quarter, missing forecasts of $8.76 billion. The company did release some new computers earlier this year, including a 15-inch MacBook Air and faster desktops. Apple blamed the steep decline on manufacturing challenges for the Mac last year. The company lost sales during the June quarter a year ago, only to regain them from pent-up demand in the September period. That set up a poor comparison for this year.\n\nRead More: Apple Unveils New Laptops, iMac and Trio of More Powerful Chips\n\nRevenue for the September quarter might have been stronger if the company had released new iPads during the period, which it sometimes does, or made more significant changes to its accessories. The latest Apple Watches and AirPods only represent modest tweaks from their predecessors.\n\nThe Wearables, Home and Accessories segment, which includes the watch, AirPods, Apple TV set-top box and Beats headphones, brought revenue of $9.32 billion. That fell short of the $9.41 billion estimate.\n\nThe services segment generated $22.3 billion in sales, beating Wall Street targets of $21.4 billion. That\u2019s an all-time record for the category. The company is looking to make that business even more lucrative: It raised the prices for Apple TV+, Arcade and News+ last month, though that change was too recent to affect these results.\n\nThe iPad brought in revenue of $6.44 billion. Though that was a 10% decline from last year, it was better than the $6.12 billion projection. Apple hasn\u2019t introduced a new iPad this calendar year, the first time that\u2019s happened since the product first debuted in 2010. It did, however, release a cheaper Apple Pencil stylus for its tablets this week.\n\n(Updates with more commentary from conference call starting in 10th paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe US Housing Market Has Become an Impossible Mess World\u2019s Safest Market Becomes a Magnet for Big Investors These Five Countries Are Key Economic \u2018Connectors\u2019 in a Fragmenting World Shipping Startup Flexport Is in Crisis Mode Heading Into the Holiday Season Foxconn Makes Your iPhone.

Just as it looked like the final trading months of 2023 were going to be more of the same tepid activity, we blast off +564 points on the Dow. It finished +1.7% on the session. The Nasdaq was up +232 points or +1.78%, while the S&P 500 gained +1.89%. The small-cap Russell 2000, still playing catch-up with its major index peers, jumped an excellent +2.69% today.\r\n\r\nLeading up to a Fed meeting where interest rates were thought to not be increased, and then they weren\u2019t, gave something of a relief rally to the proceedings. Worsening weekly and continuing jobless claims this morning actually helped justify the Fed\u2019s decision to not raise rates, and perhaps most importantly of all \u2014 bond yield rates came down notably from their multi-year highs, with the 2-year back below 5% and the 10-year down to 4.663%. This has triggered a seemingly automatic re-attraction to the equities market.\r\n\r\nThe biggest company reporting earnings today is the biggest company in the world: Apple AAPL, which put out fiscal Q4 numbers after the closing bell today. Results were fine, but not the boffo figures we\u2019d grown accustomed to over the years: earnings of $1.46 per share outpaced the Zacks consensus $1.39, and grew +13% year over year. Revenues of $89.5 billion surpassed the $89.03 billion expected, and swung to a profit year over year.\r\n\r\nBut for a company of Apple\u2019s magnitude, with the new iPhone 15 having come out in the quarter, these numbers aren\u2019t exactly hot (not nearly as hot as some of the phones were getting) \u2014 especially for a company trading at 26x forward earnings. Growth in the U.S. was OK, but not much in China. The company did set an all-time record for Services revenue and issued a 24-cent per share cash dividend, but shares have dropped about -1% in late trading.\r\n\r\nBooking Holdings BKNG, on the other hand, posted +36% earnings growth in its Q3 earnings this afternoon to $72.32 per share, on $7.3 billion in sales that outshone the Zacks consensus $7.23 billion and grew +21% year over year. The company saw \u201cresilience in leisure/travel demand\u201d in the quarter. However, the statement provided no guidance, and perhaps the reason we\u2019re seeing a -6.6% drop in shares in the after-market is because we\u2019re selling the news. Some investors were also looking for a stock split, and once again they did not get one.\r\n\r\nBooking rival Expedia EXPE reported record adjusted EBITDA up +13% to $1.2 billion in its Q3 report out after the bell, with earnings of $5.41 per share easily taking out the $5.15 expected, on $3.93 billion in revenues for the quarter which topped the $3.87 billion analysts were looking for. Shares are up +9% in late trading, likely to do with adjusting for its recent downtrodden value levels. Its One Key loyalty program reportedly brought good early results.\r\n\r\nTomorrow morning brings us the big Employment Situation report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). We\u2019re expecting to see around 170K new jobs filled for October \u2014 about half what the BLS reported the previous month \u2014 on an expected +3.8% Unemployment Rate. These are both historically good numbers, even if they pale in comparison to the previous month. Other employment metrics have depicted dwindling job adds across all sectors; we shall see if this is where we find ourselves tomorrow.\r\n\r\nQuestions or comments about this article and/or author?

The shares have fallen by nearly 10% from their all-time highs reached in July amid worries about the sales slowdown and that China may prohibit purchases of iPhones by government workers amid rising tensions with the U.S., at the same time China's Huawei rolls out new smartphones that pose tougher competition.\n\nThe Cupertino, California, company didn't fare as well in China as analysts had hoped in the most recent quarter, with revenue in that region declining 2% from the same time last year.\n\nApple\u2019s overall revenue regression stems largely from the longer periods consumers are holding on to their iPhones in an era of incremental improvements to the newest models, as well as the ongoing pressures on household budgets from still-abnormally high inflation.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"The big question is if this is just a blip, or signs of a bigger shift among consumers as rising interest rates and a weaker economic backdrop discourage consumers from making pricey purchases,\" said Investing.com analyst Jesse Cohen.\n\nTo help juice its revenue, Apple has been raising some of its prices. The starting price for its top-of-the-line iPhone 15 Pro Max unveiled in September is $1,200, a $100 bump from last year\u2019s version of that device. Just last week, Apple raised the prices for several of its subscription products, including its video streaming service, which boosted its monthly fee 43% to $10 per month.\n\nIn a bright spot, Apple's iPhone sales climbed 3% to $43.8 billion \u2014 a sign the company's latest models are being well received heading into the holiday shopping season.\n\nApple\u2019s service division also turned in a robust quarter with revenue of $22.31 billion, a 16% increase from last year.\n\nA big chunk of that revenue flows from Google, which pays Apple for its search engine to be the automatic option for responding to queries made on the iPhone and the Safari browser \u2014 a deal that is now the focal point of an antitrust trial over whether the alliance between the two tech powerhouse stifles competition and innovation.\n\nEvidence submitted during the trial has revealed that Google paid more than $26 billion to Apple and other companies to put its search engine in a privileged position during 2021.

Net income rose about 11%. Profit per share of $1.46 beat analyst expectations of $1.39 per share, according to LSEG.\n\nApple shares, which have risen 37% so far this year, closed up 2% on Thursday. They were down 1.3% in trading after the bell, having pared gains after the results were published.\n\nBut the results do not include the bulk of sales from Apple's newest iPhone 15 models. Analysts and investors will be closely watching a conference call scheduled for 5 p.m. EDT (2100 GMT) during which executives will give an outlook for the company's all-important holiday sales quarter, historically the most important for the new devices.\n\nApple is facing tougher competition in the smartphone market this year as Huawei Technologies returns to the field with new phones powered by Chinese-made chips after being all but shut out of the market for several years by U.S. government trade curbs.\n\nApple's sales in China fell 2.5% to $15.08 billion from $15.47 billion in the fourth quarter a year ago. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said that after accounting for foreign exchange rates, Apple's business in China grew year-over-year, driven by iPhone sales and services revenue.\n\n\"In mainland China, we set a quarterly record for the September quarter for iPhone,\" Cook told Reuters. \"We had four out of the top five best-selling smartphones in urban China.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nCook also said two of Apple's new high-end handset models - the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max devices - are facing supply constraints.\n\n\"We're working hard to manufacture more of them,\" he said. \"We do believe that later this quarter, we'll reach a supply-demand balance.\"\n\nSeveral global trends are also playing in Apple's favor, with forecasters predicting that the smartphone market has bottomed out and may start to recover in 2024.\n\nThe personal computer market is also expected to fare better in the coming year. Earlier this week, Apple rolled out new Mac machines.\n\nIn the longer term, investors are eying how Apple responds to the boom in generative artificial intelligence in which systems can follow prompts in human-like ways - an area that has attracted billions in spending by Microsoft and Alphabet's Google. Apple has said it is working on the technology and views it as a way to improve a wide range of products.\n\nFor now, the iPhone remains Apple's biggest seller. Sales of the device were $43.81 billion in the fourth quarter, in line with analyst expectations of $43.81 billion, according to LSEG data.\n\nSales in Apple's wearables segment, which includes the Apple Watch and AirPods, fell 3% to $9.32 billion, short of estimates of $9.43 billion, according to LSEG data.\n\nApple has faced several quarters of declining sales of Macs and iPads, and the fourth quarter continued that trend. Mac sales slumped by a third to $7.61 billion and iPad sales declined 10% to $6.44 billion, compared with expectations of $8.63 billion and $6.07 billion, respectively, according to LSEG data.\n\nSales in Apple's services segment, which includes Apple TV+ and which recently closed a deal with global soccer superstar Lionel Messi, rose 16% to $22.31 billion, compared with analyst estimates of $21.35 billion.\n\n(Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco and Yuvraj Malik in BengaluruEditing by Sayantani Ghosh, Peter Henderson and Matthew Lewis)", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-beats-quarterly-estimates-iphone-203156489.html", "symbols": ["AAPL.MX", "AAPL.US", "AAPL34.SA", "APC.F", "APC.XETRA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.995, "neg": 0.002, "neu": 0.91, "pos": 0.088}}, {"date": "2023-11-02T20:30:57+00:00", "title": "Apple earnings top estimates, iPhone sales notch September-quarter record", "content": "Apple (AAPL) reported earnings after the bell on Thursday that beat expectations and set another record for sales generated by its growing services business, though results showed total revenues declined for the fourth-straight quarter.\n\nIn its fiscal fourth quarter, Apple reported earnings per share of $1.46 on revenue that reached $89.5 billion.

"Warren Buffett is undeniably the greatest living investor. Since becoming chairman of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A)(NYSE:BRK-B) in 1965, he generated returns of 3.7 million percent for investors. That\u2019s a near 20% annual return or twice that of the S&P 500 index.\n\nWhile partially a result of his buy-and-hold philosophy, the best Warren Buffett stocks are those with a simple, consumer-facing business that he bought at a good price. Allowing management do its thing and letting his winners run, the investing genius amassed a fortune for himself and his followers.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean sometimes his stocks don\u2019t do poorly. But Buffett\u2019s overarching themes for investing remain in place, and sometimes his stocks go on sale. It means patient investors can sometimes buy the same stocks as Buffett at prices even better than what he paid. And right now Wall Street says some of them are poised for liftoff.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe following three stocks are forecast by analysts to grow between 88% and 242% over the next year. While you can ride the coattails on these Warren Buffett stocks to profit, do your due diligence anyway. Even the Oracle of Omaha says he\u2019s made mistakes with stocks he bought.\n\nUnited Parcel Services (UPS) United Parcel Service (UPS) truck on Interstate in the American West. UPS stock.\n\nSource: sladkozaponi / Shutterstock\n\nPackage delivery giant United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) has been a part of Buffett\u2019s portfolio since 2006. He paid on average around $75 per share. UPS never split its stock, but it has paid a dividend ever since going public. The carrier also increased the payout for 14 straight years. It currently yields 4.6% annually.\n\nThe stock was never a large holding in Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s portfolio. At its peak, he owned about 1.4 million shares. Today, though, Buffett only holds 59,400 shares. At the current price of $140 per share, that values his stake at $8.4 million. Not too shabby for mere mortals, but for Buffett it\u2019s a paltry sum. UPS is the smallest position in the Berkshire portfolio.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile you won\u2019t be buying the stock at less than what Buffett did, it\u2019s still worth considering. Wall Street has a high-end target price of $265 per share, which implies there is 88% upside in its stock over the next year.\n\nUPS business is a solid, steady grower. Although it often lagged behind the benchmark index, it still generated a 9% total return over the past 15 years. The stock dropped recently on a lower revenue outlook ahead of the peak holiday season, but that puts UPS at one of its lowest valuations in over a decade. It goes for 14 times trailing and estimated earnings while the dividend yield is at its highest point, save for during the pandemic.\n\nDon\u2019t expect UPS stock to become a rocket, but for a \u201csteady Eddie\u201d stock for your portfolio, the package delivery expert will perform admirably over time.\n\nBank of America (BAC) The logo of Bank of America (BAC) in modern office building in Beverly Hills, California\n\nSource: Tero Vesalainen/Shutterstock\n\nGoing from least to most, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) is the biggest stock holding in Buffett\u2019s portfolio on a shares-owned basis. Berkshire Hathaway owns over 1 billion shares of the bank, putting its valuation at $27.2 billion. That\u2019s second only to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nThe stock is down 20% year-to-date after investor confidence in the banking system was shaken following the collapse of several high-profile financial institutions earlier this year. However, Buffett never wavered on Bank of America. Even as he sold off other financial stocks, he held firm with this bank.\n\nAfter excoriating the way most banks operate, Buffett told shareholders he remained cautious about owning bank stocks, but \u201cwe do remain with one bank\u2026I like Bank of America and I like the management.\u201d\n\nWall Street is just as confident in its future. Analysts see as much as 108% upside in the stock with a high-end price target of $55 per share. There\u2019s good reason for the exuberance. Although high interest rates are weighing heavily on consumers, Bank of America exceeded earnings and revenue estimates due to increased interest income as a result of higher borrowing costs. More consumers are using their credit cards, lifting average loan and lease balances. It\u2019s an indictment of current economic conditions, but a silver lining of sorts for investors.\n\nBank of America is trading at severely discounted valuations, including at just a fraction of its book value. The market still views its earnings growth suspiciously, but that will turn eventually. Buying now will reward you handsomely later on.\n\nParamount Global (PARA) PARA stock: the Paramount plus logo on a phone in front of a screen displaying various Paramount TV shows and movies\n\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock\n\nAdmittedly Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA) isn\u2019t a stock Buffett has expressed the greatest confidence in. He told CNBC, \u201cIt isn\u2019t fundamentally that good of a business.\u201d He said the movie studio\u2019s decision to slash its dividend was \u201cnot good news.\u201d And he\u2019s worried about Paramount\u2019s future in the streaming business because higher prices are needed but that\u2019s incompatible with retaining viewers.\n\nStill, Buffett maintains a significant holding of Paramount stock, some 93.7 million shares worth over $1 billion. It\u2019s equivalent to a 15% stake in the entertainment company. Analysts are especially exuberant about where its price can go. They have a $37 per share high-side price target on the stock, which means Wall Street expects to see shares nearly quadruple in value.\n\nThe stock trades at less than 10 times earnings estimates and a miniscule fraction of its sales. Still it\u2019s a tough business that will likely see more fallout from providers. The ongoing Hollywood strike isn\u2019t helping business and theaters are ailing. Although Buffett owns a good chunk of the company and Wall Street seems enamored with the stock, Paramount Global isn\u2019t one that I\u2019d be rushing to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

A perfect example happened not long ago, when PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL)\u00a0stock\u00a0dropped even though there wasn\u2019t any terrible news about the company. This is fine, though, as it just opened up a window of opportunity for value seekers to invest in PayPal.\n\nGranted, there is some uncertainty surrounding PayPal\u2019s\u00a0CEO transition and competition in the payments space from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Regarding the first point, PayPal\u2019s investors need to be patient, as executive-level transitions take some time and the anxiety will pass. As for Apple, I\u2019ll explain how PayPal and Apple are actually working together to make payments easier for customers.\n\nPYPL Stock Slides Into the Buy Zone\n\nIt\u2019s been frustrating, no doubt, for investors to watch PYPL stock to decline since February. However, there\u2019s no need to lose faith. If you liked the stock at $87 in February, then you should like it even more at its current price.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAfter all, the data suggests that PayPal\u2019s valuation is quite reasonable. The company\u2019s trailing-12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 14.4x is substantially lower than PayPal\u2019s five-year average P/E ratio of 53.58x.\n\nA specific event, which wasn\u2019t precipitated by PayPal, prompted some panic and caused the PYPL stock price to fall recently \u2014 but I\u2019ll get to that in a moment. First, I wanted to point out that even if PayPal and Apple are competitors in some ways, they\u2019re also working together.\n\nHere\u2019s the rundown. Reportedly, PayPal\u2019s customers can now add \u201celigible PayPal and Venmo credit or debit cards\u00a0to Apple Wallet\u201c. There\u2019s a convenience factor here as PayPal and Venmo users can make payments via an iPhone or Apple Watch.\n\nFurthermore, PayPal and Venmo users who added their cards to Apple Wallet can then use Apple Pay on an iPhone, an iPad or a Mac. It just goes to show that rivals in the payments space, like PayPal and Apple, can serve customers better and create a win-win situation by working together.\n\nStory continues\n\nFright in France Puts Pressure on PayPal\n\nSo, here\u2019s the event that prompted fear on Wall Street about fintech companies like PayPal. After hearing this, you may be shocked at how irrational and panicky some financial traders can be.\n\nOn Oct. 25, Visa (NYSE:V) reported quarterly results indicating robust international travel and cross-border payments volume. Yet, the U.S. stock market decided to ignore this green flag.\n\nInstead, they focused on Worldline, a French payments company that\u2019s not even listed on a major U.S. stock exchange. Worldline released its financial results the same day that Visa did, and slashed its full-year financial guidance.\n\nWorldline stock dropped 59% in Paris, and the company warned investors about the challenging macroeconomic conditions in Europe and especially in Germany. Among the ripple effects was a selloff in U.S. payment stocks, including PYPL stock.\n\nDaniel O\u2019Regan, a managing director at Mizuho Secuirites, attributed the share-price decline to \u201ca few things.\u201d These included\u00a0the \u201ccontinued Worldline hangover, fear of more consumer slowing\u201d and \u201ccompetitive threats from Apple as it gets bigger in the buy-now-pay later space.\u201d\n\nAs I\u2019ve explained, I believe there\u2019s room for PayPal and Apple to coexist and even collaborate to the benefit of the customers. Moreover, Visa\u2019s results paint a different, less bleak picture of the international payments space.\n\nMizuho Securities analyst Dan Dolev wrote that the U.S. stock reaction to the Worldline warning was overblown. I tend to concur, and I feel it\u2019s irrational for the market to punish PayPal, which doesn\u2019t generate most of its revenue from Europe.\n\nPYPL Stock: Buy the Dips and Hold On for Years\n\nIt\u2019s a positive sign that Apple is willing to work with PayPal. Sure, they\u2019ll continue to compete, but the two companies can also complement each other in some ways.\n\nMeanwhile, the Worldline warning shouldn\u2019t scare PayPal\u2019s investors into panic-selling their shares. PayPal has survived international challenges before. Plus, the company\u2019s CEO transition is a temporary concern. In the long run, the new leadership could bring new growth opportunities to PayPal.\n\nSo, don\u2019t let the headlines in the financial press frighten you. PayPal\u00a0is here to stay, and now is a great time to buy PYPL stock. It\u2019s trading substantially below its February peak price, so feel free to buy some PayPal shares while they\u2019re still cheap.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel\u00a0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nDavid Moadel has provided compelling content \u2013 and crossed the occasional line \u2013 on behalf of Motley Fool, Crush the Street, Market Realist, TalkMarkets, TipRanks, Benzinga, and (of course) InvestorPlace.com.

Headliners like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), and Taiwain Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) capture investor attention. And, in most cases, they\u2019re direct funnels for retail investor capital.\n\nBut secret semiconductor stocks are hiding in today\u2019s market. If you find them, you could be positioned to ride the next leg up as automation, machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI), and more unstoppable trends begin their next leg up. Ultimately, look to one of two things. First, find semiconductor stocks with a niche end item (like a specific part of electric vehicle assemblies, for example). These companies typically dominate their market and are unshakable from that position.\n\nAlternately, look to companies leveraging widespread tech utilization. Semiconductors are an integral part of daily life, and we don\u2019t usually know it. Some companies make components for hundreds of products you interact with daily. These companies spread their risk across many sub-sectors and industries, which also serves to ensure longevity.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nInfineon (IFNNY) AI. Circuit board. Technology background. Central Computer Processors CPU concept. Motherboard digital chip. Tech science background. Integrated communication processor. 3D illustration representing semiconductor stocks. semiconductor stocks to buy and hold\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nInfineon (OTCMKTS:IFNNY) is a strategic stock that taps into two hot sectors:\u00a0 semiconductor stocks and electric vehicle (EV) stocks. This European company specializes in semiconductor manufacturing. Its components are part of many applications, including powering essential vehicle components such as infotainment systems, dashboards, and more.\n\nInfineon\u2019s semiconductors also play a crucial role in less glamorous but vital EV features like anti-lock brake systems, airbag deployment mechanisms, and air conditioning. As EVs evolve into increasingly higher-end automotives (due to R&D costs reducing manufacturing expenses), demand for these semiconductors will skyrocket. Infineon is one of the few chip manufacturers ideally positioned to capitalize on this growing demand.\n\nStory continues\n\nBeyond simply safety features, the EV infotainment system outlook is especially strong. According to a research report, the demand for EV infotainment systems is expected to see an annual growth of 38% through 2030. As vehicle internals become increasingly intricate, semiconductor demand follows suit. Infineon\u2019s unique position within this niche of the EV value chain sets it apart from broad, niche-use semiconductor stocks.\n\nSemiconductor Stocks to Buy: Lattice Semiconductor (LSCC) In Ultra Modern Electronic Manufacturing Factory Design Engineer in Sterile Coverall Holds Microchip with Gloves and Examines it. Semiconductor stocks to sell\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nLattice Semiconductor (NASDAQ:LSCC) is a bigger-picture semiconductor stock focusing efforts on a range of \u201cbig data\u201d computing solutions, including edge and cloud computing. At the same time, its core products span across end items ranging from televisions to laptops. This market penetration ensures Lattice\u2019s staying power and recent financials point to strength for this overlooked semiconductor company.\n\nAcross the board, LSCC improved its financial standing in this week\u2019s earnings report. Revenue expanded 11% year-over-year. LSCC adapted to cost-cutting initiatives and expanded its gross margin. Likewise, the company\u2019s free cash flow jumped 40% and management executed the twelfth consecutive quarter of share buybacks. Despite the great news, shares fell off a cliff after earnings, posting a net 35% loss over October. What gives?\n\nIn a word, demand slowed slightly. AI/ML enthusiasm reached a fever pitch, and, critically, consumers are slashing spending. This means that, generally, the firms with an AI advantage have sufficient computing power to continue for the foreseeable future.\n\nAt the same time, consumer sentiment slowing means LSCC\u2019s peripheral products like televisions are sitting on shelves. Of course, the upcoming holiday season could mark a trend reversal. Still, LSCC\u2019s strong financial position means it can withstand a few periods of flat sales growth. At the same time, its expansive portfolio ensures longevity in a competitive industry.\n\nSkyworks Solutions (SWKS) the Skyworks website is loading on a smartphone\n\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\n\nSkyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) is another niche semiconductor stock with deep market penetration. SWKS services wireless companies. Its semiconductors are vital to the overall wireless ecosystem, and they\u2019re found in cell towers and individual user phones alike. SWKS stands to specifically gain from increased 5G network connectivity, as its components assist in band switching and other technical traits associated with 5G.\n\nBeyond its broad market opportunity, SWKS is entrenched with industry juggernauts like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), to whom SWKS owes nearly 60% of its 2022 revenue. Of course, reliance on a single source isn\u2019t ideal. But the broad 5G market is set to grow 32% annually through 2030, cushioning SWKS\u2019 precarious reliance on Apple\u2019s whims.\n\nInstitutional investors see something in SWKS and own 84% of the company\u2019s total shares. As the saying goes, \u201cFollow the smart money.\u201d Massive institutional giants are the definition of smart money. With 19 companies holding more than half the float, they\u2019re staking much of their financial future on SWKS\u2019 success \u2013 pointing to the fact that there\u2019s something special about this semiconductor stock.\n\nSemiconductor Stocks to Buy: Wisekey (WKEY) semiconductor stocks Close-up electronic circuit board. technology style concept. representing semiconductor stocks. top semiconductor stocks to buy now\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nWisekey (NASDAQ:WKEY) is a penny stock, a rare trait among semiconductor stocks. But this diversified tech stock, which provides cybersecurity solutions and Internet of Things integration, increasingly relies on its semiconductor sector as \u201cstrategic premium revenue\u201d in the United States. That semiconductor segment exploded 38% in the most recent report, marking an important milestone as (like we saw with SWKS) general demand falls.\n\nNotably, WKEY also serves as a space stock play alongside its semiconductor status. The company enjoys a strategic partnership with Elon Musk\u2019s brainchild, SpaceX, to launch and maintain a series of satellites. Those satellites reinforce WKEY\u2019s Internet of Things paradigm, offering greater device connectivity and faster execution times.\n\nOnto Innovation (ONTO) a close up image of a semiconductor\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nOnto Innovation (NYSE:ONTO) is technically a semiconductor support stock but one vital to the overall industry. The support stock is still riding the AI wave, and its year-to-date surge of 65% isn\u2019t the end of this hardware company\u2019s story.\n\nIn August, the company unveiled a massive $100 million deal for its Dragonfly inspection system. This hardware plays a pivotal role in identifying flaws and defects in third-party semiconductors, a critical operational concern for companies like Nvidia.\n\nOnto holds a firmly established position within the semiconductor supply chain based on that inspection requirement, making it a key semiconductor stock. Onto\u2019s services cater to a diverse range of customers, given that chips have become an integral component in most electronic systems.\n\nAs AI demand grows, the existing GPU and tech stack market, currently valued at $3.16 billion, will expand to $25.5 billion by 2030. As companies strive to lead the charge in the semiconductor \u201cspace race\u201d, Onto stands in the prime position to capitalize on this trend, irrespective of the ultimate victor.\n\nSemiconductor Stocks to Buy: Microchip Technology (MCHP) Microchip (MCHP) logo at HQ in Silicon Valley. Microchip Technology Inc. manufactures microcontrollers, mixed-signal, analog and Flash-IP integrated circuits\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrochip Technology (NASDAQ:MCHP) is deeply embedded in your daily life, whether you know it or not. The semiconductor stock makes a range of control systems ranging from garage door openers to chip readers. If there\u2019s a theme for this list, MCHP embodies semiconductor stock potential: these components are increasingly entrenched in our daily lives. To that end, investors looking for semiconductor stocks to buy need to target those that link us with everyday objects in a way we don\u2019t even consider as we go about our business.\n\nA recent report highlights this thesis. Analysts detailed that the electroluminescent driver market, of which MCHP is a key component, will explode over the next few years. Never heard of the electroluminescent driver market? Me neither, but you interact with it daily.\n\nLaptops, cell phones, internal car light systems, and more \u2013 all leverage that market and integrate MCHP semiconductor products when doing so. Morningstar pegs MCHP\u2019s fair value 30% above its current share price. That seems reasonable, considering MCHP\u2019s far-reaching market penetration (even if you haven\u2019t heard of many of its core offerings!).\n\nFabrinet (FN) a machine manufactures semiconductor chips in a factory setting. AI Semiconductor Stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nFabrinet (NYSE:FN), our final semiconductor stock, is like ONTO because it serves a supporting role in the semiconductor industry. But that role, like ONTO\u2019s, is massive.\n\nFabrinet specializes in standardized electronic and technical component manufacturing. Those components are, in turn, used by companies to assemble their final products. This is akin to how automobile manufacturers, for instance, outsource the production of components like doors before assembling the complete vehicle in their facilities.\n\nHowever, in Fabrinet\u2019s case, it manufactures optical communication components and advanced lasers for companies such as Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), which happens to be their largest revenue-generating customer.\n\nBut beyond their core blue-chip clientele, experts see how semiconductor sectors and AI enthusiasm can push Fabrinet to the stratosphere. Following a robust earnings report, analysts have raised the consensus price target for Fabrinet to $165, largely due to their promising AI-related opportunities. FN stock popped nearly 40% since that collective upgrade, but shares remain below the price target.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Nvidia constitutes 13% of Fabrinet\u2019s revenue, and other AI-focused data communications companies are increasingly drawn to the company. Similar to Onto Innovation, Fabrinet\u2019s components play a critical role in fueling the growth and expansion of AI markets.\n\nImportantly, the success of both these companies is not dependent on the specific winners in today\u2019s competitive AI landscape. They stand to benefit from the broader trend, regardless of which companies ultimately emerge as victors or face challenges in the AI race.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

Shares have risen by over 30% in 2023, with traders comforted by the popularity of Apple's products and solid cash flow.\n\nYet its fiscal fourth quarter sales are expected to come in at $89.34 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus forecasts -- a fall from $90.1B in the same period last year and the fourth straight quarterly drop.\n\nMeanwhile, analysts at JPMorgan Chase have flagged that headwinds are looming as Apple progresses through the December quarter, particularly in the form of a strong dollar, iPhone supply problems, and rising competition from rival Huawei in its key Chinese market. Lackluster global consumer spending momentum is also driving an elongation in the replacement cycle of smart devices, they argued.\n\n\"Sentiment has turned more challenging for shares of Apple in recent days,\" the JPMorgan analysts said in a note. They added that they will be on the lookout for commentary around the estimated quarter-on-quarter evolution of Apple's sales of gadgets like the iPhone, iPad tablets, and Mac laptops. Projected growth in the double digits is also expected at the company's services business, which includes offerings like Apple TV+ and AppleCare device insurance.\n\nAnalysts at Barclays have warned that Apple's guidance for its current quarter -- typically its biggest by revenue thanks largely to the holiday season -- may potentially miss Wall Street estimates, citing in part signs of softening demand for new iPhones. Fresh versions of Apple's flagship smartphone, which feature a redesigned titanium body and USB-C charging port, were launched in September.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple's executives may also face questions around their plans to keep pace with other tech industry rivals in the intensifying race to harness and monetize the nascent growth of generative artificial intelligence, observers said. Heavy capital expenditures could be needed to grow A.I.'s presence in the business, although this would likely cause free cash flow to decline in Apple's 2024 fiscal year, according to analysts at KeyBanc.\n\n\"We believe [Apple] has a solid foundation of A.I. within its products and services though [it] has very little room for incremental capital investment in 2024 while also growing [free cash flow],\" the KeyBanc analysts wrote in a note.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nApple's December quarter outlook in focus ahead of latest earnings report\n\nNovo Nordisk, Lilly see insatiable demand for weight-loss drugs\n\nCanada Parliament panel asks Ottawa to reject RBC, HSBC unit deal", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apples-december-quarter-outlook-focus-112519473.html", "symbols": ["AAPL.MX", "AAPL.US", "AAPL34.SA", "APC.F", "APC.XETRA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.991, "neg": 0.037, "neu": 0.833, "pos": 0.13}}, {"date": "2023-11-02T11:21:45+00:00", "title": "Trending tickers: Novo Nordisk | Moderna | Apple | Paypal", "content": "Novo Nordisk's weight-loss drug Wegovy helped make the drugmaker the biggest company in Europe.

Why is its trial being held in secret?", "content": "Google: Maker of the best search engine, or just the most popular? (Jeff Chiu / Associated Press)\n\nThe public has been riveted for weeks by the most important federal trial for the tech world in a quarter-century.\n\nThe criminal trial of accused cryptocurrency scam artist Sam Bankman-Fried, right?\n\nNo, not that. We're talking about U.S. vs. Google, a massive antitrust trial unfolding in a federal courtroom in Washington, D.C.\n\nGoogle is their first choice based on legitimate considerations of quality and price. It should be sufficient to say that the antitrust laws do not exist to punish a successful competitor or hold an umbrella over less-efficient rivals.\n\nGoogle explains why it thinks customers choose its search engine\n\nFunny thing about that, however. No one is paying much attention to that case for a couple of reasons. To begin with, the arguments on both sides are mind-numbingly technical, seeking to establish whether the deals in which Google is alleged to have cemented its search engine into Apple computers and iPhones and Android smartphones \u2014 to such a degree that no other search engine has a prayer of gaining ground \u2014 are illegal.\n\nBut there's another, vastly more important reason. Largely at Google's behest, Judge Amit P. Mehta has conducted much of the trial behind closed doors.\n\nSince the nonjury trial began Sept. 12 \u2014 it's expected to continue for as much as several more weeks \u2014 he has allowed hundreds of crucial documents and countless hours of testimony to be submitted and conducted in secret.\n\nMehta also refused to allow audio transmission of the proceedings. (Google asserted in court that an audio feed would only be exploited for \"clickbait.\")\n\nAnd with limited exceptions, the judge turned away pleas by news organizations to open more of the proceedings to public view. In September, he ruled that litigants \"may\" post trial exhibits online. But according to a motion filed Oct. 16 by the New York Times, since he didn't say they \"must\" do so, since that ruling \"none of the parties has provided consistent access to exhibits used in open court.\" (Emphasis in the original.)\n\nStory continues\n\nUnder the circumstances, Google \u2014 or Alphabet, its parent company \u2014 has already won a significant victory in this case. Even if the judge rules against the company, it has managed to keep crucial information about how it conducts its business out of the public eye.\n\nRead more:Column: Yes, Amazon is a near-monopoly. Dismantling it will be harder than you think\n\nThis situation underscores one of the chief failings of the American legal system: It often functions as a private playground for rich litigants.\n\nWealthy criminal defendants can exploit the bail system to stay out of jail in advance of their trials, while poorer defendants who can't raise the necessary cash spend pretrial months in stir.\n\nWith the connivance of federal judges who wish to keep their dockets pared down, big corporations force aggrieved consumers and workers into arbitration, where the latter are at a disadvantage.\n\nAnd now this, where a company worth $1.6 trillion can defend its dominance of a huge high-tech landscape while letting the public know only what it wants them to know. Want to know what's in this document filed in the Google antitrust trial? Tough. (U.S. v Google)\n\nThe experience of Microsoft, the last big tech company to face an antitrust prosecution of this magnitude, illustrates what a boon the secrecy is for Alphabet. The earlier case concluded in 2001 with a trial judge's ruling that Microsoft had illegally monopolized the market for computer operating systems. He ordered the company broken up.\n\nAn appeals court overturned the breakup order. The government and Microsoft reached a settlement paring back the company's ability to impose anticompetitive restrictions on computer makers. But Microsoft's reputation took a hit from the public's view of its bare-knuckle tactics and its efforts to gull the court with allegedly falsified evidence.\n\n\"One result,\" observes consumer advocate Matt Stoller, \"was that Microsoft, afraid of public exposure years later, refused to use its control over the browser to kill nascent rivals, in particular a young search company called Google.\"\n\nThe dwindling cadre of reporters following the trial have to do so in person. They get almost no advance warning of when they'll be barred from the courtroom for the day. They just have to turn up to find out.\n\nOne important witness, former Google executive John Giannandrea, testified in open court for ten minutes on Sept. 21. Then the press and public were excluded and he continued his testimony in secret for another four hours.\n\nGoogle doesn't deserve all the blame for this secrecy. The government hasn't protested the company's demands to seal documents and testimony \u2014 the Department of Justice did post some evidentiary filings online, until the judge ordered that it wait for his approval before doing so again.\n\nGoogle's partners in some of the business arrangements the government plaintiffs are challenging, including Apple, have also asked to keep testimony involving them confidential. The judge has generally agreed.\n\nRead more:Column: That big Albertsons-Kroger merger will enrich millionaire insiders at your expense\n\nDecisions to close a trial from public view, in any event, belong to the judges, and they're expected to do so only in special cases. Mehta, however, has been criticized for allowing Google effectively to dictate when material falls into the exclusionary category of trade secrets.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a trial judge,\" he said at a pretrial conference this summer. \"And so I take seriously when companies are telling me that if this gets disclosed, it\u2019s going to cause competitive harm.\"\n\nThat brings us to the nuts and bolts of the case. It was initially brought by the Department of Justice in 2020, during the Trump administration, and was eventually consolidated with a similar case brought by several red states that were then campaigning against Big Tech for purportedly discriminating against conservative voices. The plaintiffs' cadre has greatly expanded, with the addition of 15 blue states, including California.\n\nThe main allegation concerns how Google established itself as the default search engine on Apple devices, web browsers such as Opera and Mozilla, and smartphones made by LG, Motorola and Samsung with contracts and financial blandishments that essentially closed off the search market to competitors.\n\nNot even the resurgent Microsoft has been able to breach the wall for the benefit of its search engine Bing, which is mired at about 7% of the search market against Google's estimated 88%. Bing's share is so meager that specialized search providers \u2014 think Open Table and TripAdvisor \u2014 \"have little interest in working with Microsoft, except, perhaps, as an after-thought,\" according to the plaintiffs' pretrial brief.\n\n\"Because our reliance on Google has actually only increased,\" an unidentified representative of one of those providers testified, \"Bing ... is kind of not relevant anymore. It has been pushed out.\u201d\n\nRead more:Column: Biden could remake American society by reviving antitrust enforcement\n\nThe plaintiffs say that Google achieved its dominance partially by relying on the power of the default in guiding consumer behavior. Put simply: Humans being creatures of habit, the vast majority of phone and computer users will stick with the first app pushed at them in any category.\n\nConsequently, Google had made great efforts to become the default search engine on all those devices, making lucrative deals with Apple and the other manufacturers to place its search engine on home pages and browsers. To this day, users of Apple's Safari browser search the web with Google unless they take deliberate steps to choose an alternative.\n\nEven now, a government lawyer said on the first day of trial, Google spends $10 billion a year to ensure that its search engine remains the default on devices of all kinds. Efforts by competitors to dislodge it have invariably fallen short. In 2018, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella testified, his company was even willing to drop the \"Bing\" name from its search engine brand if that would enable it to secure a default slot from Apple. It didn't work.\n\nThe technical arguments raised at the trial turn on whether Google's arrangements with the device and browser companies are \"exclusive\" \u2014 if so, that would strengthen the plaintiffs' position that the company engaged in illegal anticompetitive conduct.\n\nGoogle says in its defense that there's nothing exclusive about these deals. All its partners are free to offer users alternative choices \u2014 the contracts merely make Google the default.\n\nUsers of Apple's Safari, for example, can reconfigure their browser to use Yahoo, Bing, DuckDuckGo, or Ecosia by choosing them from a drop-down menu. Nothing keeps iPhone or smartphone users from installing a widget for any other search engine on their home screen or home page.\n\nGoogle's position is that users are making a free choice on the merits. \"Google is their first choice based on legitimate considerations of quality and price,\" it says in its court filings. \"It should be sufficient to say that the antitrust laws do not exist to punish a successful competitor or hold an umbrella over less-efficient rivals.\"\n\nRead more:Column: This government price-fixing case makes the tuna industry sound like the mafia\n\nEven a government witness, economist Michael Whinston of MIT, acknowledged that if all Android smartphone users were given a free choice of search engines upon acquiring their phones, \"Google would be selected more than 90% of the time,\" as Mehta described his testimony. Whinston estimated the \"shift\" from Google to other search engines would only be \"approximately 1% of all search queries in the U.S.\u201d\n\nYet that could merely reflect the dominance of Google in consumers' minds, as evidenced by the evolution of the brand name into a generic term for web searching.\n\nThe plaintiffs contend that the ability of users to choose an alternative to Google search is nothing but a smokescreen obscuring its powerful dominance. Given Google's position, they say, \u201ca monopolist could enter into any contract \u2014 no matter its effects on competition \u2014 so long as one rival existed and made some feeble attempt to secure the business.\" The dominant firm would only continue to get stronger until \"it had managed to wipe out all vestiges of present or future competition.\u201d\n\nThere's something to that. Anyone who has tried to change the default search engine on Apple's Safari to something other than Google knows that it's not an intuitive process. Nothing on the Safari screen tells the user even where to go to make the choice; you just have to know.\n\n(As a service to readers, on a Mac it's done by navigating to the Safari tab at the top of the computer screen, choosing \"Preferences,\" then going to the \"Search\" tab and finding the options on the drop-down menu. On an iPhone you have to go to the \"Settings\" icon, scroll down and click on \"Safari,\" then click on \"Search Engine.\" Simple, isn't it? No wonder no one ever does it.)\n\nI'm not an Android user, so for those devices you're on your own. I'm sure you can Google it.\n\nWhatever happens in this trial, it will happen at a pace that makes an adagio tempo feel like an all-out sprint. The judge isn't expected to rule until early next year; if he rules against Google, another proceeding will then have to be held to ponder remedies. In the meantime, there will be no getting away from Google or its fellow Alphabet apps, including Gmail, the Chrome browser, Google Play, Google Books and more than I can even count.\n\nIs this good for us as individuals or for our society? Despite their ubiquity, not all these apps are the best available. Chrome is slow, a memory hog, and has been known to snarf up users' private search data for the company's purposes. Google search itself has been compromised by the deals its owner has made to steer users to websites belonging to the company's corporate partners. As I asked back in 2012, after the Federal Communications Commission called it out for privacy violations, \"Has Google become too big to trust?\"\n\nTo ask the question is to answer it, but in case that\u2019s not explicit enough, the answer plainly is yes.\n\nMore competition might well drive the company to address these shortcomings for fear of losing users to rivals. But it doesn't have any competition to speak of. So we're living in Google's world, crossing our fingers in the hopes that the company will live up to its original slogan, \"Don't be evil.\"\n\nGet the latest from Michael Hiltzik\r\nCommentary on economics and more from a Pulitzer Prize winner.\r\nSign me up.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/column-googles-dominance-affects-us-100017811.html", "symbols": ["AAPL.MX", "AAPL.US", "AAPL34.SA", "ABEA.F", "ABEA.XETRA", "ABEC.F", "ABEC.XETRA", "APC.F", "APC.XETRA", "GOGL34.SA", "GOGL35.SA", "GOOG.MX", "GOOG.US", "GOOGL.US", "MSF.F", "MSF.XETRA", "MSFT.MX", "MSFT.US", "MSFT34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.994, "neg": 0.04, "neu": 0.892, "pos": 0.068}}, {"date": "2023-11-02T09:30:00+00:00", "title": "Proportion of India-made iPhones to double by 2024 while Foxconn's output in China to shrink, TF Securities analyst says", "content": "India will continue to rise as an iPhone production base in the coming years while Foxconn's production of the Apple smartphone in China could shrink significantly, according to a research report.\n\nThe proportion of India-made iPhones, which account for 12 to 14 per cent of global shipments in 2023, is expected to reach 20 to 25 per cent of the total next year if production expansion goes smoothly, Kuo Ming-chi, a TF International Securities analyst known for his accurate assessment of Apple's business, wrote in a note on Wednesday.\n\nApple's major supplier Foxconn Technology Group, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry, currently operates 75 to 80 per cent of the iPhone production capacity in India, according to Kuo's report.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world?

Futures inch higher after Fed verdict\n\nU.S. stock futures were trading higher on Thursday, with investors digesting the Federal Reserve's decision to leave interest rates unchanged.\n\nBy 05:55 ET (09:55 GMT), the Dow futures contract had gained 102 points or 0.3%, S&P 500 futures had added 22 points or 0.5%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had risen by 107 points or 0.7%.\n\nThe U.S. central bank's Federal Open Market Committee on Wednesday voted to keep the all-important federal funds rate steady at a target range of 5.25% to 5.50%, although Chair Jerome Powell flagged that the process of bringing inflation back down to policymakers' 2% objective \"has a long way to go.\"\n\nAfter the announcement, the benchmark S&P 500 climbed by 1.1%, while the 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite moved up by 0.7% and 1.6%, respectively. European and Asian equities both followed Wall Street into the green, in a possible sign that global investors are becoming more confident that the Fed has finished tightening policy this year.\n\nElsewhere, the dollar fell against a basket of its peers, while the price of Bitcoin -- the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capital -- hit its highest mark since May 2022.\n\n2. Powell vows to proceed \"carefully\"\n\nThe Fed's choice to keep borrowing costs at a more than two-decade high may have been widely cheered by markets weary after months of unprecedented rate hikes, but Powell noted in a closely-watched post-meeting news conference that officials are still asking themselves if more increases are warranted.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor now, he stressed that the Fed will only \"proceed carefully,\" arguing that monetary policy is currently at a \"restrictive\" level.\n\nSome eyebrows were raised by the statement, particularly in the wake of unexpectedly strong data which hinted at a surprising resilience in the U.S. economy. This trend has in turn sparked worries that a recent cooling in inflation could lose steam.\n\nHowever, Powell remained confident that inflation would continue to decelerate, albeit in \"lumps.\" In any event, the comments pointed to the delicate task before the Fed: corralling price pressures without causing deep economic malaise.\n\n3. Apple earnings ahead\n\nAttention now turns to Apple as the tech giant prepares to unveil earnings for its September quarter after the closing bell on Thursday.\n\nFor the iPhone maker's stock, 2023 has so far been a positive year. Shares have risen by just over 30% over that time, with traders comforted by the company's popular product offerings and solid cash flow.\n\nYet its fiscal fourth quarter sales are expected to come in $89.28 billion, which would be a fall of around 1% compared to the same period last year and the fourth straight quarterly drop.\n\nFor the December quarter, a possible downturn in demand in the firm's key Chinese market and lackluster consumer spending sentiment have been cited by analysts as looming headwinds. Indeed, analysts at Barclays have warned that Apple's guidance for its current quarter -- typically its biggest thanks to holiday season shopping -- may potentially miss Wall Street estimates.\n\n4. Shell increases share buybacks\n\nLondon-listed shares in Shell jumped in early trading after the oil major announced share buybacks of $3.5 billion over the next three months, up from $2.7 billion in the prior quarter.\n\nMeanwhile, the company left its dividend at $0.331 per share despite a quarterly performance that Chief Executive Officer Wael Sawan described in a statement as \"strong.\"\n\nShell's adjusted third-quarter earnings of $6.2B met company-provided market estimates, although the figure was 34% lower on an annual basis. Solid trading at its liquefied natural gas unit helped offset a drop in energy prices and a decline in production at its Integrated Gas division.\n\n\"We continue to simplify our portfolio while delivering more value with less emissions,\" Sawan said.\n\n5. Crude ends three-day decline following Fed decision\n\nOil prices rebounded Thursday, snapping a three-day fall, after the Fed kept interest rates on hold, hitting the dollar and helping risk appetite return to financial markets.\n\nBy 05:55 ET, the U.S. crude futures traded 1.6% higher at $81.72 a barrel, while the Brent contract climbed 1.4% to $85.83 per barrel. Both benchmarks settled at their multi-weeks lows in the previous session, having dropped around 10% in October.\n\nMarkets largely traded past U.S. inventory data, with official data from the Energy Information Administration showing a slightly smaller-than-expected build in oil inventories over the week to October 27.\n\nDistillate inventories declined by less than anticipated, while gasoline inventories saw an unexpected but limited build.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFutures higher after Fed decision, Apple earnings ahead - what's moving markets\n\nFederal Reserve's swift rate hikes stir investor apprehension\n\nNorges Bank holds policy rate steady, hinting at possible stabilization", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/futures-higher-fed-decision-apple-055911414.html", "symbols": ["AAPL.MX", "AAPL.US", "AAPL34.SA", "APC.F", "APC.XETRA", "DJI.INDX", "IXIC.INDX"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.985, "neg": 0.062, "neu": 0.836, "pos": 0.102}}, {"date": "2023-11-02T05:15:00+00:00", "title": "AI Is About to Remake the PC.

The chip company reported adjusted earnings of $2.02 per share versus estimates of $1.92. Revenue of $8.67 billion was better than the expected $8.51 billion. Fiscal fourth-quarter guidance was also better than expected.\n\nQualcomm's CEO, Cristiano Amon, spoke with Yahoo Finance last week while at the company's Snapdragon Summit in Hawaii, having a positive attitude on the company's new chip product and future performance against competitors like Apple (AAPL) and Intel (INTC).\n\nAngelo Zino, CFRA Research Senior Equity Analyst, joins Yahoo Finance to discuss Qualcomm's latest quarterly earnings and how the company has a great opportunity to step in the ring with its competitors in the PC market.\n\n\"When you look at how far they've [Apple] pushed the limits in terms of their silicon chip that they just launched this week, based on 3-nanometer technology, it is still ahead,\" Zino says. \"We think of the Qualcomm's of the world, which just kind of launched based on their 4-nanometer technology, with that said, it is absolutely an opportunity for Qualcomm, it's also going to be an opportunity for a name like Nvidia, which probably gets into the CPU PC market in 2025. \"\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n- And Angelo, we did have-- the company came out unveiled that new PC chip, and we had the CEO on Yahoo Finance, he was talking very tough there about-- listen, he can outperform Apple, he can outperform Intel. Maybe not near-term, but let's say intermediate long-term. Do you see that as a tailwind for the company?\n\nANGELO ZINO: Listen, I think it's an opportunity for them. I mean, whether it be getting into PCs or other markets where they're not really deeply entrenched in. I think it's definitely an opportunity, where there is kind of new revenue opportunities for them. Now that being said, you look at what Intel has said about ARM-based chips into the PC market. They don't necessarily believe it.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut when you think about what Apple has done on the ARM-based side of things, dumping Intel and how successful they've been kind of taking share here over the last two to three years, it's been pretty impressive. Now, Apple, of course, is Apple. And when you kind look at how far they've pushed the limits in terms of their M3 silicon chip that they just launched this week based on 3-nanometer technology, it is still ahead. We think of the Qualcomm's of the world, which just kind of launched based on their 4-nanometer technology.\n\nBut that said, it is absolutely an opportunity for Qualcomm it's also going to be an opportunity for a name like NVIDIA, which probably gets into the CPU PC market in 2025, so they're going to be other opportunities out there for companies that haven't had the opportunity on the side of things because it has been dominated by x86 Architecture, specifically by Intel.\n\nSo an opportunity, whether or not it transitions too much I think, again, remains to be seen and probably is going to take a couple of years before you see notable kind of revenue potential.\n\n- Angelo, you mentioned Apple, and I would be remiss if I didn't ask about it. I mean, obviously Qualcomm is a little bit of an unusual indicator when it comes to Apple because it's both a client of and competitor too at this stage. But what's the read through if any from Qualcomm to what we're going to hear from Apple?\n\nANGELO ZINO: I wouldn't read too much into it. I mean, we've learned that in the past, right? I mean, you kind look at just the last quarter results, and Qualcomm took a big beating, and Apple actually did fairly well. So I don't know if I'd look too much into it. But that said, you know I do think you're seeing a stabilization in terms of the broader smartphone market out there.\n\nThey're probably going to see some challenges, clearly on the China side of things. And we clearly want to know a lot about what Apple has to say about China tomorrow night. But nonetheless, I mean, it's a good sign that the broader market in terms of smartphones is stabilizing. It'll be important to see what Qualcomm on this call has to say, if anything, about the Android versus kind of the iOS ecosystem out there.\n\nMy guess is some of the uplift or a good amount of the uplift is coming on the Android side of things because it's been so beaten down. But nonetheless, I think it's definitely promising to see a stabilization within the smartphone side of things.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/video/qualcomm-big-opportunity-pc-market-211708228.html", "symbols": ["AAPL.MX", "AAPL.US", "AAPL34.SA", "APC.F", "APC.XETRA", "INL.F", "INL.XETRA", "INTC.MX", "INTC.US", "ITLC34.SA", "QCI.F", "QCI.XETRA", "QCOM.MX", "QCOM.US"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.998, "neg": 0.018, "neu": 0.863, "pos": 0.119}}, {"date": "2023-11-01T21:12:06+00:00", "title": "Apple earnings, Jamie Dimon interview: What to Watch", "content": "Yahoo Finance Live anchor Josh Lipton looks ahead to the earnings results due out from Apple (AAPL), Eli Lilly (LLY), and Paramount (PARA).\n\nHe also previews Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi\u2019s exclusive interview with JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon airing live at 6:00 P.M.

These are companies whose stocks will build wealth over time.\n\nCall it patient capital. Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) makes the grade. But that\u2019s an obvious choice.\n\nTo come up with the three names, I\u2019ll use three criteria reflecting quality businesses with rock-solid financials that generate sustainable growth.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCriteria # 1: The company has a strong balance sheet. That\u2019s especially important in today\u2019s higher interest rate environment. What\u2019s a strong balance sheet? I prefer businesses with net cash or, at the very least, net debt less than 25% of their market capitalization.\n\nCriteria # 2: The company has an above-average return on invested capital (ROIC). This is defined, according to MarketWatch\u2019s Philip van Doorn, as \u201cits profit divided by the sum of the carrying value of its common stock, preferred stock, long-term debt and capitalized lease obligations.\u201d\n\nCriteria # 3: The company has a CEO who\u2019s been in their job for at least five years, preferably longer. A long tenure is generally the sign of someone who can lead through different economic cycles.\n\nWhile there are plenty of quality smaller companies, I\u2019ve limited my selections to stocks with a market cap of at least $10 billion.\n\nFortinet (FTNT) The Fortinet logo on a wall\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nFortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) qualifies with $2.32 billion in net cash, an average ROIC over the past 12 quarters of 55.39%, and Fortinet CEO Ken Xie has held the top job since co-founding the company in October 2000 with his brother Michael Xie.\n\nThe cybersecurity company has over 680,000 global customers, generating more than $1.5 billion in quarterly billings from its 50+ enterprise cybersecurity products. It reports earnings on Nov. 2 after the markets close. The company is expected to deliver $1.35 billion in revenue \u2014 20% higher year-over-year (YOY) \u2014 with earnings per share of $0.36 (10% higher YOY).\n\nStory continues\n\nOf the 30 analysts covering its stock, 21 rate it a Buy or Strong Buy, with a $72.41 target price, 27% higher than where it\u2019s currently trading. FTNT shares are up 294% over the past five years, over 3x the Nasdaq.\n\n\u201cFortinet has been GAAP profitable and free cash flow positive every year since its IPO in 2009,\u201d states pg. 5 of the company\u2019s September 2023 presentation.\n\nThe company aims to deliver annually on the \u201cRule of 40\u201d, defined as the combination of revenue growth and non-GAAP operating margin. In 2023, it expects it to be 48%. While down from 60% in 2022, it\u2019s still well above 40%. Since 2009, it has met the rule in all but three years.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shop. Apple Layoffs\n\nSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) qualifies with $46.8 billion in net debt, an average ROIC over the past 12 quarters of 52.26%, and CEO Tim Cook has held the top job since 2011.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to add anything new to what\u2019s already been written about the iPhone maker in recent years. So, I\u2019m returning to something I said about Apple in July 2014.\n\n\u201cI see growth investors coming back to AAPL stock when it can consistently deliver gross margins of 40% or more while also growing top-line revenue by double digits. If the iWatch and iTV along with a bigger iPhone 6 are all well-received, it\u2019s a certainty that growth investors will return to the flock,\u201d I wrote on July 25, 2014.\n\nHow\u2019d that work out?\n\nIn the nine months ended July 1, 2023, its gross margin was 43.8%, 20 basis points higher than a year earlier. While top-line revenue will likely fall in 2023 due to lower sales across all its products, offset by higher services revenue, it has increased annual sales by double digits multiple times since 2014.\n\nWhile we\u2019re still waiting on an Apple TV and Apple Car, the iWatch and iPhone have certainly delivered for shareholders.\n\nApple reports Q4 results on Nov. 2 after the close. It won\u2019t be pretty, but consider 2023 a reset year for the company. I\u2019m sure Warren Buffett does.\n\nAutoZone (AZO) A photo of a series of cars with their hoods up in a garage.\n\nSource: Memory Stockphoto/ShutterStock.com\n\nAutoZone (NYSE:AZO) qualifies with $10.2 billion in net debt (23% of its market cap), an average ROIC over the past 12 quarters of 38.60%, and CEO Bill Rhodes has held the top job since 2005.\n\nIt\u2019s not been a stellar year for AZO stock. It\u2019s up just 1.9% year-to-date and down more than 2% over the past 52 weeks. However, AutoZone shares are up 226% over the past five years, more than 4x the S&P 500.\n\nOf the 27 analysts covering its stock, 12 rate it a Buy or Strong Buy, with a $2,849.75 target price, 15% higher than where it\u2019s currently trading.\n\nIn 2023, it generated $17.46 billion in revenue, 7.4% higher than in 2022, with an operating profit of $3.47 billion, 6.1% higher than a year earlier. These are workmanlike, unspectacular numbers, so its shares are trading at 2.71x sales, its lowest multiple since 2020.\n\nThe retailer of automotive aftermarket parts expects 2024 to be a better year. It finished fiscal 2023 (August 26) with 6,300 stores in the U.S., 740 in Mexico and 100 in Brazil. As Rhodes said in its Q4 2023 press release, \u201c[W]e continued to be pleased with our International stores\u2019 performance and we are excited about future growth prospects across both Mexico and Brazil.\u201d\n\nThe need for replacement parts is never going away. That\u2019s about as good a guarantee as you\u2019ll get in business. Its quality management takes care of the rest.\n\nAutoZone is the sleeper stock of the three.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

There are several key items that investors will be keeping an eye on during this announcement. Yahoo Finance spoke to experts and analysts across the industry to break down the most important things to know.\n\nKineo Capital Managing Partner Jim Strugger broke down a potential option trade for investors to watch based on Apple earnings. Strugger explained, \"The outcome we're structuring for is for the stock to move very little after earnings ... really taking advantage of pumped up implied volatility and selling that to the people that believe that Apple could move very sharply either up or down.\"\n\nYahoo Finance Technology Editor Dan Howley discussed all of the details of Apple's new products and how they may impact earnings. Howley said, \"They did announce some new chips and some new laptops, as well as a new iMac ... For the current quarter that's about to be reported though, Apple sales for laptops supposed to be lower, for desktops supposed to be lower. Overall, it looks as though this is going to help improve the Mac revenue. We just have to see how much of an impact it has.\"\n\nCreative Strategies CEO and Principal Analyst Ben Bajarin also discussed Apple's new product line and some of the challenges that Apple is facing ahead of earnings. Bajarin noted, \"They are up against some supply constraints, particularly as they're moving to a new process technology for the high end iPhones ... looking at ASPs and gross margins will be very telling about if that new buyer base is skewing toward the higher end, which is what I think has been the trend over the last couple years.\"\n\nVideo highlights:\n\n00:00:03 - Kineo Capital Managing Partner Jim Strugger\n\n00:00:40 - Yahoo Finance Technology Editor Dan Howley\n\n00:01:14 - Creative Strategies CEO and Principal Analyst Ben Bajarin", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/video/apple-earnings-everything-investors-watching-154039617.html", "symbols": ["AAPL.MX", "AAPL.US", "AAPL34.SA", "APC.F", "APC.XETRA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.781, "neg": 0.031, "neu": 0.91, "pos": 0.058}}, {"date": "2023-11-01T15:36:14+00:00", "title": "Should You Buy These 2 \u2018Magnificent Seven\u2019 Stocks Ahead of Earnings? Apple and Nvidia in Focus", "content": "What should investors make of this year\u2019s third-quarter earnings? The Q3 results have been pretty good, with 78% of companies reporting so far beating the forecasts, but stocks are still feeling pressure. One obvious sign of that pressure: the S&P 500 this week hit its lowest point since last May, and is just shy of correction territory.\n\nThe effect is most clearly seen in the \u2018Magnificent Seven,\u2019 a group of Big Tech giants whose gains earlier in the year carried the markets generally \u2013 but which are facing serious losses lately, despite solid earnings results. Four of these tech giants \u2013 Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft \u2013 have reported earnings so far, and all beat expectations. The group as a whole is expected to show a 33% year-over-year increase in profits this earnings season. Even so, the Magnificent Seven stocks are down 11% since the end of July.\n\nBut does this mean you shouldn\u2019t buy in? Wall Street\u2019s analysts are weighing in on that question, especially relevant with both Apple and Nvidia scheduled to release earnings in the near future. These are iconic names, leaders in their respective industries, and they have proven records of long-term success. Let\u2019s put them into focus ahead of their upcoming financial releases to see where they stand now and why some analysts are recommending \u2018Buy\u2019 ahead of the earnings results.\n\nDon\u2019t miss\n\nNuclear Power Is the Future \u2014 and These Stocks Are Leading the Charge J.P. Morgan Sees at Least 60% Gains in These 2 \u2018Strong Buy\u2019 Stocks \u2014\u00a0Here\u2019s Why They Could Soar \u2018Buy the Dip\u2019: Analysts Say These 2 Beaten-Down Stocks Offer a Compelling Entry Point \u2014\u00a0Here\u2019s Why They Could Rebound\n\nApple(AAPL)\n\nWe\u2019ll start with a company that needs little introduction: Apple. Apple\u2019s $2.67 trillion market cap makes it the largest publicly traded firm in the world. The company is best known for its iconic products, including the iPhone line, iPads, and MacBook computers. Apple\u2019s success was built on its reputation for high-end quality and the professional-level applications that the Mac computer lines could support. In recent years, the company has been expanding its service segment.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple has also been working to integrate AI technology into its user experience. The company has used it to improve the autocorrect feature on its iPhone line and is using AI to create a smarter AirPod, making an earbud that will recognize when the user is having a conversation and automatically lower the volume.\n\nSmall tweaks have kept the product lines popular with consumers, and Apple weathered a serious industry-wide drop in smartphone sales earlier this year. Industry research showed that smartphone shipments fell 24% in 1H23, but Apple saw only a 6% decline in iPhone sales. By the end of the half, Apple held a 55% market share in smartphones.\n\nIn its last reported quarter, fiscal 3Q23, which ended on July 1, Apple posted revenues of $81.8 billion, marking a 1% year-over-year loss, and earnings of $1.26 per diluted share, indicating a 5% year-over-year gain. These results were considered positive, especially in light of the overall decline in smartphone sales. The company also reported having more than 1 billion paid subscription customers, driving its Services segment to record revenues. Looking forward, the Street expects Apple to report $89.4 billion in revenue and $1.39 in earnings per share when it reports its fiscal Q4 financial results on November 2.\n\nCovering Apple for Morgan Stanley, analyst Erik Woodring writes of the upcoming earnings, \u201cWe expect Apple to post an in-line to better than expected September quarter (F4Q23), highlighted by MSD Y/Y iPhone revenue growth, accelerating Services growth, and record gross margins. However, we are more cautious on the December quarter (F1Q24) given iPhone supply shortages and uneven consumer spending, and believe Apple will guide to a revenue range that is both below normal seasonality and Consensus expectations. Looking at the rest of the mega cap tech names that reported this earnings season, the companies that have guided to December quarter profitability in excess of Consensus have seen greater post-earnings outperformance than those guiding closer (or below) to Consensus, and therefore we lean cautiously into earnings on Thursday.\u201d\n\nEven though he is somewhat cautious, Woodring goes on to give an upbeat bottom line: \u201cHowever, with the potential for iPhone upside later in the quarter (if supply improves; akin to the iPhone 13 cycle) and/or a better than seasonal March quarter, Services growth accelerating, and shares near what we believe is a near-term floor (of $160), we are bullish over the next 12 months.\u201d\n\nThe analyst\u2019s stance supports his Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating on the shares, and his $210 price target implies a gain of nearly 23% for AAPL over the next 12 months. (Watch Woodring\u2019s track record)\n\nOverall, the analyst consensus on Apple is a Moderate Buy, based on 31 recent reviews that break down to 22 Buys and 9 Holds. The shares are selling for $171.40 right now, and their $203.35 average price target suggests a one-year upside potential of ~19%. (See Apple stock forecast)\n\nNvidia Corporation(NVDA)\n\nNext up is Nvidia, a leader in the global semiconductor chip industry \u2013 and another of the stock market\u2019s handful of trillion-dollar-plus companies. Nvidia has built its dominance around high demand for its top-end GPU chips, which were originally developed for high-end gaming apps but have found strong market share with professional graphic designers and AI developers as well. The launch of ChatGPT last November, and the subsequent boom in AI, opened up even more opportunities for Nvidia.\n\nProminent among those opportunities was the announcement from ChatGPT\u2019s creator, OpenAI, that it will need as many as 10,000 new GPU chips in the coming year in order to maintain current performance levels of the popular chatbot. Nvidia is already a leading supplier for the Microsoft-backed company, and now looks at 2024 from the happy vantage point of having a satisfied high-volume customer.\n\nIt\u2019s not just AI that\u2019s powering Nvidia\u2019s growth. The company saw more than $10 billion in data center revenue, as customers went all-in on the company\u2019s high-end, advanced computing chips. This accounted for the majority of Nvidia\u2019s $13.5 billion revenue in fiscal 2Q24, surpassing expectations by $2.43 billion. The firm\u2019s non-GAAP EPS figure, of $2.70, was 61 cents ahead of the forecasts. Looking ahead to the company\u2019s upcoming fiscal 3Q24 release, the expectations are for continued growth \u2013 revenue of $15.99 billion, and earnings of $3.37 per share.\n\nFor 5-star analyst Ambrish Srivastava, writing from BMO, all of this adds up to a bullish picture for the long term. Srivastava says of Nvidia, \u201cWe believe as a company NVIDIA is likely experiencing the best visibility it has ever had. NVIDIA highlighted that its visibility for data center is backed by purchase orders, which are required for allocation requests from customers given supply constraints, with customers with large commitments likely getting priority\u2026 NVIDIA appears confident in its ability to secure supply into next year, both on the CoWoS side for the more complete GPU solutions, as well on the networking side, particularly in infiniband.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead, the analyst, who is rated by TipRanks in the top 3% of the Wall Street stock pros, lays out a clear path for Nvidia in the near-term: \u201cNVIDIA sees a very large addressable TAM ($1T installed base of data center infrastructure), with the company today addressing a single-digit percentage of the annual data center spend. NVIDIA sees a long-term tailwind of the installed base from general purpose CPUs to accelerated computing and generative AI.\u201d\n\nSrivastava quantifies his outlook on Nvidia with an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating, and a price target which, at $600, points toward a robust 47% gain in the coming year. (Watch Srivastava\u2019s track record)\n\nOverall, Nvidia has a Strong Buy consensus rating from Wall Street, supported by 38 analyst reviews with a lopsided split of 37 Buys to 1 Hold. The stock is priced at $407.80 \u2013 and its $645.53 average target price suggests an appreciation of 55% on the one-year horizon.

The S&P 500 has fallen 9% from its 2023 high reached in late July, though it is still up just over 9% year-to-date.\n\nLip said his firm owns shares of all seven companies and has recently added to its holdings in some of them.\n\nOthers have been buying as well. Tech stocks saw $2 billion of net inflows last week, their largest in about two months, analysts at BofA Global Research said in a report. Data from Vanda Research showed retail investors\u2019 net buys of nine big tech and growth stocks reached 31% of total flows, after being below 30% for most of the month.\n\nWhether the dip buyers are right will hinge in part on the trajectory of Treasury yields, which have risen to 16-year highs on fiscal worries and expectations that the Federal Reserve will need to keep interest rates higher for longer in order to decisively defeat inflation. The Fed will conclude its latest monetary policy meeting on Wednesday.\n\nStory continues\n\nHigher yields increase the cost of capital for businesses and households, while also making government bonds a more attractive alternative to equities. The 10-year benchmark Treasury yield has risen about 100 basis points since late July as stocks have come under pressure.\n\nAnother important test will come on Thursday when Apple, the largest U.S. company by market value, reports results. Shares of several megacap companies have been hit hard by negative reactions to their earnings reports, including those of Google parent Alphabet, Tesla and Meta Platforms, the parent of Facebook and Instagram.\n\n\"Unfortunately, because interest rates are high and we have a war in the Middle East, pretty good is just not good enough,\u201d said Jay Hatfield, CEO of InfraCap. \"The bar is extraordinarily high to have a real beat.\"\n\nKim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners, which holds Apple shares, said she was looking for insight into the extent of potential saturation of the smartphone market and the willingness of consumers to buy the next iPhone model.\n\n\"They are the phone provider of choice for the developed world,\u201d Forrest said, adding: \"As goes Apple, so goes the S&P, just because of its weighting.\u201d\n\nApple\u2019s shares, which alone have a weighting of over 7% in the S&P 500, are up 31% year-to-date.\n\nSome investors are differentiating among the seven. Hatfield prefers Nvidia and Microsoft as companies that have the most leverage to artificial intelligence trends.\n\nThomas Ognar, senior portfolio manager at Allspring Global, said the Dynamic Growth Equity team's portfolios at Allspring are overweight Amazon and Meta. Both companies are showing bottom-line benefits from cost controls, while Amazon's cloud computing business may have already bottomed and Meta is showing improvements in areas such as short-form videos, Ognar said.\n\nAs a group, the Magnificent 7 still show common traits that have supported their share outperformance, including being massive collectors of data, Ognar said.\n\n\"You can see that they have had some competitive advantages which they have been utilizing and I think have been on display this year, which is why the stocks have done well,\u201d Ognar said.\n\n(Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf; editing by Ira Iosebashvili and Jonathan Oatis)", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysis-wavering-magnificent-seven-draw-134320708.html", "symbols": ["AAPL.MX", "AAPL.US", "AAPL34.SA", "APC.F", "APC.XETRA", "GSPC.INDX"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.997, "neg": 0.038, "neu": 0.826, "pos": 0.136}}, {"date": "2023-11-01T13:21:40+00:00", "title": "The 'Magnificent Seven' stock market leaders went their separate ways in October", "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" tech giants that have led the 2023 stock market rally saw their fortunes diverge in October as earnings, industry narratives, and investor fatigue worked through this group of leaders.\n\n\"At this point you can't look at them as seven stocks together,\" Interactive Brokers chief strategist Steve Sosnick told Yahoo Finance Live on Tuesday.\n\nLast month, Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) were the only members of the group to post gains greater than 1% with the Seattle-area giants rising 4.7% and 7.1%, respectively. Both companies reported quarterly results that revealed growth in their cloud units above investor forecasts.\n\nMeanwhile, rival Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) saw shares drop more than 5% after downbeat results from its cloud business, while Nvidia (NVDA) lost 6% amid reports the Biden administration could limit AI chip exports to China.\n\nTesla (TSLA) stock fell nearly 20% after its latest results showed weaker than expected profits amid an overall concern about the adoption rate of EVs.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) issued softer than expected guidance for the fourth quarter, though the stock finished the month basically flat, rising 0.4%. Apple (AAPL) stock logged a similarly lackluster month, falling 0.3% after a more than 8% drop in September; the iPhone maker will report results on Thursday.\n\nValuations come under scrutiny\n\nThe diverging paths for these names also reflect broader themes weighing on stocks this earnings season.\n\nThe bar to please investors when discussing AI has shifted. Both Microsoft and Amazon passed that test, while investors felt \"too much AI benefit\" might've been embedded into Alphabet's stock, according to Jefferies tech analyst Brent Thill.\n\nTesla, which has at times been swept up in the AI narrative on the back of self-driving ambitions, has had more near-term concerns like slimming margins and the prospects of its Cybertruck launch catching investor attention.\n\nStory continues Tesla's Cybertruck is displayed at Manhattan's Meatpacking District in New York City, U.S., May 8, 2021. REUTERS/Jeenah Moon\n\nThe shift from seemingly any AI promise lifting the major tech players comes as investors have placed more scrutiny on results across the corporate world this earnings season.\n\nWith the Fed's \"higher for longer\" interest rate outlook looming over the overall trajectory of stocks, investors have again resurfaced a debate over whether the run-up in the Magnificent 7 simply pushed stock valuations out too high.\n\n\"There are real risks here,\" Sosnick added. \"These stocks are expensive and it's not like you're taking a risk on a stock that's got a very affordable valuation.\" Magnificent 7 forward price to earnings ratios remain above that of the S&P 500, reflecting that those stocks are more highly valued. (Source: Truist Wealth)\n\n'There's still a lot lacking'\n\nInvestors over the last several months have consistently referenced data showing the majority of the S&P 500's gains this year have been driven by this handful of successful stocks, which account for about 30% of the index's market cap.\n\nBut this momentum can also work in reverse.\n\nAs Bianco Research president Jim Bianco recently pointed out in a post on X, the Magnificent Seven have helped drive down the S&P 500 since mid-summer highs, just as this group once helped the benchmark index rise more than 20% at one point this year.\n\nIndex investors are \"going to feel\" the divergence of the Magnificent Seven as their outsized weighting in the S&P 500 can direct the index's movement, Charles Schwab chief markets strategist Liz Ann Sonders told Yahoo Finance.\n\nBut as Sonders and other Wall Street strategists noted at the start of October, the path toward a \"healthier\" market rally isn't all about these few winners.\n\n\"If you start to see better breadth [outside the Magnificent Seven], I would view that as a positive,\" Sonders said in an interview on Tuesday.\n\nAnd there have been signs of a broadening out, though this trend hasn't fully taken shape, Sonders noted.\n\nThe Russell 2000 recently hit its lowest level since its October 2022 lows. Financials (XLF) are still down more than 5% this year. And even better-than-expected earnings aren't proving to be a major driver.\n\n\"There's a lot that is lacking about what the market has done in the past year and all you have to do is look under the surface of some of those biggest stocks to see what some of those missing links are,\" Sonders said.\n\nSo now as the rising tide of the Magnificent Seven recedes, it's becoming more clear which sectors of the market might have been swimming without a bathing suit during the 2023 rally.\n\nThe question how becomes which of these areas are best positioned to regroup.\n\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.\n\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-magnificent-seven-stock-market-leaders-went-their-separate-ways-in-october-132140735.html", "symbols": ["AAPL.MX", "AAPL.US", "AAPL34.SA", "ABEA.F", "ABEA.XETRA", "ABEC.F", "ABEC.XETRA", "AMZ.F", "AMZ.XETRA", "AMZN.MX", "AMZN.US", "AMZO34.SA", "APC.F", "APC.XETRA", "DJI.INDX", "FB2A.F", "FB2A.XETRA", "GOGL34.SA", "GOGL35.SA", "GOOG.MI"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.996, "neg": 0.032, "neu": 0.869, "pos": 0.099}}, {"date": "2023-11-01T12:45:53+00:00", "title": "India authorises Apple, Dell, Lenovo and others to import laptops, tablets -sources", "content": "By Shivangi Acharya\n\nNEW DELHI (Reuters) - Apple, Dell, HP, Samsung and Lenovo are among 110 firms authorised by India to import laptops, tablets and personal computers under a new system aimed at monitoring shipments, two government sources said.\n\nAcer, Xiaomi, IBM and ASUS have also been issued import authorisations, the two sources said, under India's new \"import management system\" effective from Wednesday.\n\nIndia announced the new system for laptops, tablets and personal computers last month after it rolled back an earlier plan to impose a licensing regime, following criticism from the industry and Washington.\n\nCompanies must register the quantity and value of imports on a portal, with an authorisation valid until September 2024.\n\nIndia's federal trade ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

After a rocky start, by 2010 half a million millennials in the U.K. were enrolled in the scheme that enables workers to earn money while they receive on-the-job training.\n\nBut now, Gen Z is bucking that trend.\n\nDespite the government\u2019s push to create more apprenticeships in the U.K.\u2014and despite the downplaying of the necessity of college degrees from leaders like Apple's Tim Cook and Virgin's Richard Branson\u2014young people just aren\u2019t taking it up. In fact, since 2016 the number of youngsters starting apprenticeships has fallen sharply by 31% in England, according to the CIPD\u2019s new report.\n\nThis was particularly acute among small businesses, where the number of apprentices enrolling declined by 49%, compared to just a 14% drop in large firms with 250 or more employees.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, while Gen Zers are shunning apprenticeships, millennials are still eyeing up vocational training in order to enter management without the high price tag of an MBA.\n\nAccording to the research, the majority of apprentices across the U.K. who started in 2022 were over 25 years old, with the majority of them taking up a \u201chigher apprenticeship\u201d\u2014the most advanced qualification offered\u2014in business, administration, and law.\n\nIn Scotland specifically, the number of new apprentices in their late twenties has doubled since 2019.\n\nDegrees are no longer the apple of employer\u2019s eyes\n\nThe uptick in apprenticeship schemes came as degrees fell out of favor with employers.\n\nGoogle, Microsoft, IBM, and Apple have all eliminated their long-held degree requirements for jobs to remove barriers to entry and recruit more diverse talent. Meanwhile, recruiters globally are five times more likely to search for new hires by skills over higher education.\n\nSimilarly, Cisco's top executive in the U.K. doesn't have a college degree and doesn't think young aspiring workers need one either.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"I never did anything academically beyond my GCSEs [exams taken at 16 in the U.K.] and never went to university,\" David Meads Cisco's U.K. and Ireland CEO recently told Fortune. \"But you can fast forward 40 years and here I am.\"\n\n\u201cIn university, you come out with whatever degree you may get, but it\u2019s almost certainly saddled with debt,\u201d he added. \u201cIs that better than on-the-job experience where you\u2019re rotating through different parts of our organization, and living the reality and not just the theory?\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s not the first CEO to praise skipping out on college to join the world of work as soon as possible.\n\nRichard Branson, the billionaire founder of Virgin, has repeatedly urged young people to ditch university in favor of the \u201cschool of life\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, Apple\u2019s CEO Tim Cook has echoed that there is a \u201cmismatch between the skills that are coming out of colleges and what the skills are that we believe we need in the future.\u201d It\u2019s why, he said aspiring coders in particular don\u2019t need a degree to be successful, at the American Workforce Policy Advisory Board meeting.\n\nEven when looking at the Fortune 500, the CEOs of five top 20 companies, including Costco CEO W. Craig Jelinek and Chevron CEO Mike Wirth, hold no graduate degree, proving that it\u2019s not a requirement to reach the highest level in business.\n\nBut Gen Z isn't convinced\n\nClearly, the top-level praise for apprenticeships and the shift to skills-based hiring isn\u2019t convincing aspirational Gen Zers. Instead, they\u2019re increasingly opting to go down the more traditional route of college.\n\nThe National Center for Education Statistics predicts college enrollment in America will bounce back after a 10-year decline. Meanwhile, across the Atlantic in the U.K. the number of 18-year olds applying to go to university has been rising sharply in the last two years, following 5 years of stagnation.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, apprenticeships have traditionally provided a route to well-paid, secure careers for those from more disadvantaged backgrounds, but recently there\u2019s been a shift.\n\nNow, even Gen Zers from a lower socioeconomic upbringing are shunning on-the-job training in favor of going to university.\n\nResearch shows there has been a 36% decline in apprenticeship starts by people from disadvantaged backgrounds, compared with 23% for others. Meanwhile, 28% of the 18-year-olds who enrolled in university this year come from deprived areas, compared with just under 18% in 2013.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gen-z-aren-t-taking-124550107.html", "symbols": ["AAPL.MX", "AAPL.US", "AAPL34.SA", "APC.F", "APC.XETRA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.979, "neg": 0.036, "neu": 0.891, "pos": 0.074}}, {"date": "2023-11-01T11:15:00+00:00", "title": "After a 540% Rise, Why Does Warren Buffett Still Own Apple Stock?", "content": "Some observers might say it's time to move on from the iPhone maker, but the Oracle of Omaha has his reasons to stay put.\n\nContinue reading", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/m/8510584c-17f7-3715-855d-f70044adbd41/after-a-540%25-rise%2C-why-does.html", "symbols": ["AAPL.MX", "AAPL.US", "AAPL34.SA", "APC.F", "APC.XETRA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0, "neg": 0, "neu": 1, "pos": 0}}, {"date": "2023-11-01T10:57:00+00:00", "title": "The 7 Best Cathie Wood Stocks to Buy Now: November Edition", "content": "In the dynamic world of investing, Cathie Wood stocks continue to draw both bullish advocates and bearish critics.

Counterpoint estimates China sales of the latest series were nearly 5% lower compared with the iPhone 14 in the first 17 days after launch.\n\n\"Strength of the iPhone 15 cycle is the key question heading into the December quarter,\" Bernstein analysts said, adding that they expected \"muted\" sales of the device due to a lack of new features, strained consumer spending and competition from Huawei.\n\nHuawei sold 1.6 million units of its Mate 60 Pro in six weeks, and brokerages such as Jefferies have said the firm could take back much of the market share in the coming years it lost to Apple after U.S. sanctions in 2019 hammered its business.\n\nThose fears, as well as a wider pullback in tech stocks due to high interest rates, knocked Apple shares down nearly 14% in the three months to October-end, compared with the tech-heavy Nasdaq's 11% decline in the same period.\n\nBut there are signs of an economic pick up in China. Data released last month showed the economy grew at a faster-than-expected clip of 4.9% in the third quarter - though less than the 6.3% expansion in the second quarter - while consumption and industrial activity also surprised on the upside in September.\n\nThe July-September period marks Apple's fiscal fourth quarter, and the company is expected to lay down a percentage target for sales growth for the October-December period - its fiscal first quarter that covers holiday-season shopping.\n\nStory continues\n\nWall Street analysts expect iPhone sales to rise about 6% in the October-December period, according to LSEG data. That is well below historical levels - barring 2022's holiday season quarter when Chinese COVID-19 curbs curtailed production of high-end iPhones, the average holiday quarter sales growth for the device has been 9.2% in the past four years.\n\nHowever, the fiscal first-quarter projections suggest an improvement from an estimated increase of 2.8% for the three months ended September, marking the largest rise in iPhone sales since the start of this year.\n\nOverall revenue is still expected to tick down nearly 1%, dragged by continued weakness in sales of the iPad and Mac, which are expected to fall 15% and 25%, respectively.\n\nApple earlier this week unveiled new MacBook Pro and iMac computers and three new chips to power them. The machines aimed at professional users, come at a time when the PC market is showing signs of a pick up after its over two-years-long slump.\n\nThe decline in global PC shipments slowed for a third straight quarter in the July-September period, a sign that the market has bottomed out, according to research firm IDC.\n\nThe global smartphone market contracted 8% in this period, according to Counterpoint.\n\nThe company's services business will likely be a bright spot, with estimated growth of 11.3%. The segment has often outpaced growth in Apple's hardware business in recent years and now accounts for nearly a quarter of its total revenue.\n\n(Reporting by Yuvraj Malik in Bengaluru, Writing by Aditya Soni; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty)", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apples-holiday-quarter-forecast-faces-104957700.html", "symbols": ["AAPL.MX", "AAPL.US", "AAPL34.SA", "APC.F", "APC.XETRA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.986, "neg": 0.027, "neu": 0.885, "pos": 0.088}}, {"date": "2023-11-01T10:40:00+00:00", "title": "Better Buy: Apple vs. Coca-Cola", "content": "Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) are two of Warren Buffett's favorite stocks.

The company operated out of a bland, two-story building bristling with security cameras. Engineers interviewing for jobs there weren\u2019t even told what they\u2019d be working on. Once new hires made their way into the lab, however, they learned that they would be trying to revolutionize diabetes care.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nImmigrants Are Leaving Canada at Faster Pace, Study Shows Israel Latest: Blinken Returning to Israel; Refugee Camp Hit Real Estate Industry Takes Fresh Hit With Verdict on Commissions Saudi Forces on Alert After Clash With Iran-Backed Houthis Sony\u2019s Bungie Game Unit Cut 8% of Staff After \u2018Destiny\u2019 Play Wilted\n\nAvolonte wasn\u2019t just any health-care company. It was a project of Apple Inc., and its mission came directly from Steve Jobs. Apple\u2019s co-founder and then-chief executive officer, ill with the pancreatic cancer that would take his life near the end of that year, had tasked a group of his key executives to develop a noninvasive blood sugar monitor. It would be a potentially life-changing technology for diabetics, who would no longer need to prick themselves to monitor their blood glucose. Medical device makers had tried for years to develop something like it. Even Alphabet Inc. experimented unsuccessfully with using special contact lenses to measure the glucose in tears.\n\nFour years after the quiet arrival of Avolonte, Tim Cook stood in the same packed auditorium where his predecessor, Jobs, had unveiled the original Macintosh and introduced the Apple Watch. Cook called it the \u201cnext chapter in Apple\u2019s story.\u201d The new device boasted health features: a heart rate monitor, a way to measure steps taken and calories burned and a fitness app for tracking workouts. But the original vision had been grander. The company had envisioned the watch as a tiny medical lab, featuring the Avolonte glucose monitor as a centerpiece.\n\nStory continues\n\nToday there remains a sense \u2014 both inside Apple and in the broader world of public health \u2014 of unfulfilled potential. The company\u2019s effort to weave health monitoring and disease prevention into its bestselling devices has yielded breakthroughs, but the strategy has also been short-circuited by philosophical disagreements, a culture of conservatism and technological realities. Apple has scrapped or slowed work on a broad range of promising projects, frustrating some of the doctors and engineers it hired to work on them. The details, much of which have never been reported before, are based on interviews with numerous people involved in the company\u2019s health initiatives who asked not to be identified because they weren\u2019t authorized to discuss the work.\n\nEven setting aside the formidable technical challenges, health care is a different beast from consumer electronics and telecommunications, two sectors that Apple has successfully disrupted but which only very rarely deal with death and disease. \u201cThe things that they\u2019re trying to do are not easy,\u201d said Eric Topol, a cardiologist and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute. An Apple spokesman declined to comment, but the company has said its work remains early.\n\nOnce just a bullet point, health and fitness are now key to how Apple sells the watch. The latest model includes a thermometer to measure body temperature for fertility planning, a sensor to measure blood oxygen levels, algorithms to track sleep and a system to perform electrocardiograms. The company has also turned the iPhone into a fitness tracker and has given it the ability to tap into hospital records. Apple has touted stories of its products saving lives by alerting users to deadly heart conditions and automatically calling emergency services for people who have hurt themselves in falls or car crashes.\n\nApple\u2019s efforts have helped bring health tracking into the mainstream. It has an enticing road map for 2024, including hypertension and sleep apnea detection for the watch and hearing aid capabilities for AirPods. There are plans to turn its forthcoming Vision Pro headset into a health and fitness device, too. And work continues on a paid health coach service that uses artificial intelligence.\n\n\u201cHealth is a world of opportunity to help people,\u201d said Bob Mansfield, the company\u2019s former chief of hardware engineering who helped create the company\u2019s health and smartwatch efforts. The Apple Watch\u2019s \u201cability to play a key role in health was one of the things that excited us most about building it in the first place,\u201d he told Bloomberg. \u201cCompared to today, the earliest technologies built in weren\u2019t very good. It is exciting for me to see how this idea has and continues to develop.\u201d\n\nIn Apple\u2019s ideal future, people will need fewer single-function medical devices like blood pressure checkers and thermometers, fewer blood draws and fewer visits to the doctor. Cook has said that improving health will prove to be his company\u2019s \u201cgreatest contribution to mankind.\u201d That future could be very lucrative for the company: The health and fitness tracker market is rapidly growing, with some projecting it will become a nearly $200 billion-a-year industry within a decade.\n\nThe late essayist Susan Sontag famously wrote, \u201cEveryone who is born holds dual citizenship, in the kingdom of the well and in the kingdom of the sick.\u201d Apple, by focusing on prevention, has preferred to stay in the kingdom of the well. Its core market is what\u2019s known in industry parlance as the \u201cworried well,\u201d those of us anxiously trying to decipher our body\u2019s signals for evidence that something is wrong. That makes a certain amount of sense for a consumer electronics company. Moving into curing or even caring for diseases would entangle the company in a web of different countries\u2019 regulatory regimes and present hard questions about business models. But taking them on might also mean more lives saved. And that is a recurring tension within the company.\n\n\u201cThe main takeaway from their whole strategy is that they shy away from the actual care,\u201d said Adrian Aoun, the founder and CEO of Forward, a company that runs a chain of high-tech in-person and remote clinics. Apple is building \u201cawesome technologies,\u201d but they\u2019re \u201cskating around the problem,\u201d he said. \u201cHealth care is messy, and you have to get your hands dirty,\u201d he said. \u201cAt some point you have to be ready to draw blood.\u201d\n\nIn the early 2010s, Apple began hiring health consultants, medical device experts and sleep scientists. It hired sensor mavens from places like Medtronic Plc with expertise across every metric Apple wanted its smartwatch to handle. Avolonte was the stealthiest initiative. The group was ostensibly separate from its parent company, allowing it to source components and conduct human trials without generating publicity, according to people with knowledge of the effort.\n\nOnly Apple\u2019s most senior executives were aware of what was taking place in the office 15 minutes from headquarters. Avolonte was not listed in any official Apple system, and employees were barred from bringing Apple apparel into the vicinity. Staffers donned badges with an Avolonte logo (an \u201cA\u201d crossed with an infinity symbol, a nod to the address of Apple\u2019s old headquarters, on a private road called Infinite Loop). And when Cook would visit the office for a status update, he\u2019d arrive in a baseball cap, pulled low to avoid detection.\n\nA few years and hundreds of millions of dollars into the project, Avolonte researchers settled on a technology called short-wave infrared absorption spectroscopy. This technique involves shining lasers through the skin into the interstitial fluid between the blood vessels and the cells they serve. The intensity of the light\u2019s reflection back, researchers have found, can be used to calculate the glucose concentration in the interstitial fluid and, by extension, in the bloodstream \u2014 and the only thing that has had to penetrate the body is light.\n\nStill, Apple had a ways to go before producing a market-ready sensor. A noninvasive system needs to see through a wide range of skin tones and analyze various blood types. It would also have to work indefinitely, unlike sensor patches like the FreeStyle Libre on shelves now, which prick the skin and need to be frequently replaced. And Apple\u2019s planned system calls for the use of AI to sift the raw data and generate a prediction for when a person may become diabetic.\n\nAs Apple prepared to introduce the watch in 2014, it became clear that the glucose sensor would not make it in. Nor would the blood pressure, blood oxygen and electrocardiogram capabilities the company was trying to develop. There were component sourcing issues, battery and reliability concerns and the very real problem of cramming them into the tight quarters of a device that is less than 2 inches by 2 inches.\n\nFaced with these limitations, Apple decided it made little sense to market the watch primarily as a health device. Instead, it was positioned as a bling-y tech accessory for managing incoming calls and texts, tracking fitness and, of course, telling the time. The then-design chief, Jony Ive, legendary for helping Jobs hone Apple\u2019s austerely luxurious aesthetic, prodded the company into offering $17,000 watch variants made from rose gold. Apple somewhat downplayed the heart rate monitor on the first version of the device because of the sensor\u2019s initially limited performance.\n\nSince then, Apple has worked to increase the health capabilities of the watch, believing that a fitness device could be a major new business that wouldn\u2019t cannibalize the iPhone. The glucose monitor project has continued, in secrecy, at a cost in the high tens of millions of dollars a year. As Apple reevaluated its operations when the Covid-19 pandemic hit, it decided to bring the project onto its own campus. It\u2019s now led by Apple\u2019s Exploratory Design Group, or XDG, a secretive team in the chip design division. The work was recently taken over by one of Apple\u2019s top Mac and iPhone chip executives, but, according to people with knowledge of the efforts, it\u2019s still unlikely to show up in a product for at least a few years.\n\nOther key projects were nixed during development. Apple investigated building a nutrition tracker into its Health app and looked into selling a suite of peripherals for the Apple Watch, including a bathroom scale and an Ive-designed blood pressure cuff that didn\u2019t need to inflate. The company prototyped watch straps with sensors that gather data from the underside of the wrist and researched both a bed-mounted sleep tracker and a nightstand device with sensors to monitor users overnight before pushing the technology into the watch itself.\n\nFor a time, Apple engineers were also deeply engaged in an effort to make the watch and Health app compatible with the billions of Android devices in circulation. The move, codenamed Project Fennel, would have brought the company\u2019s health features \u2014 and the health benefits Apple has repeatedly underlined \u2014 to many more people, especially in countries where Apple has little market share. But other business considerations prevailed: The work was nearly complete when Project Fennel was canceled, in part because the Apple Watch is a driver of iPhone sales. \u201cIf you gave up the watch to Android, you would dilute the value of the watch to the iPhone,\u201d said someone with knowledge of the decision.\n\nPrototypes and projects that don\u2019t make it to market are commonplace in the tech world. However, some of those working on the new technologies have chafed at the cautious nature of Apple\u2019s efforts. They say company engineers and doctors have long had to contend with fears from top executives that a poor medical experience with Apple could tarnish the perception of the company. \u201cTim and Jeff are so terrified of doing something wrong and are focused on protecting the company\u2019s image,\u201d one person said, referring to Cook and Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams, who is responsible for the company\u2019s health work. Other people with knowledge of the health team also attribute the cautiousness to privacy requirements and to the difficulty of gathering viable health data from the wrist.\n\nThat mix of trepidation and ambition shapes some of the new features the company is rolling out. The planned addition of a blood pressure sensor to the Apple Watch next year is a pathbreaking technology. In its first iteration, however, the system is designed to just tell a user if their blood pressure is trending upward and to offer a journal for the user to jot down what was happening when hypertension occurred. To avoid potentially giving a misdiagnosis, the feature will then direct a user to talk to their doctor or check their blood pressure with a traditional cuff, which can provide exact systolic and diastolic measurements. A future version of the system is in the works with an ability to provide exact numbers \u2014 and even diagnose related conditions. But those enhancements remain far off.\n\nThe blood glucose system may operate similarly at first. During development, it\u2019s been designed to monitor how a person\u2019s blood sugar is trending and warn users of prediabetes, rather than offer an actual blood sugar reading. \u201cApple is going after nanotechnology and software,\u201d a person involved in the work said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we are very good at. What we\u2019re not interested in is post-sick health care.\u201d\n\nThe distinction between health and health care defines much of what Apple will be doing for the foreseeable future. Early considerations for the virtual health and fitness coach include the ability to generate eating, sleeping and exercise recommendations from data collected from Apple devices, according to people with knowledge of its development. There are concepts, too, for tapping into device cameras to track and correct users\u2019 form while they\u2019re exercising, similar to a feature offered on Peloton Interactive Inc.\u2019s TV-connected workout device. If all goes according to plan, AirPods by next year will be able to function as an over-the-counter hearing aid and be able to perform the hearing tests typically administered in audiologists\u2019 offices.\n\nMeanwhile, Apple is laying the groundwork to turn the Vision Pro headset into a health device. The company is working on new anti-anxiety and enhanced meditation features for the product and on a virtual-reality system to reinforce positive thinking and improve mental health. Apple has also been studying using the sensors in the device to scan a wearer\u2019s eyes for cognitive health data. A headset version of Fitness+, Apple\u2019s workout video subscription, remains on the table, with the company trying to perfect a full-body tracking system that would allow the headset to decipher a person\u2019s leg movements during workouts. This would further put the $3,500 product in competition with Meta Platforms Inc.\u2019s Quest, which already lets people exercise in a virtual environment.\n\nAlso on the map for 2024 is a watch-based sleep apnea detection feature. It will use sleep and breathing patterns to estimate whether someone has the condition. It will then direct users to see a physician.\n\nStill, there are some signs that the company is exploring capabilities that would verge on treatment. Right now its pulse oximeter sensor will only show a person their blood oxygen percentage, not what the data means. The current version of the app makes this clear, telling users: \u201cBlood Oxygen measurements are not intended for medical use.\u201d The company is considering seeking health regulatory approval that would allow it to interpret the data for consumers. Apple also wants to expand the watch\u2019s thermometer so it can sense a fever, not just power its fertility tracking feature. And, last year, it launched AFib History, a feature that lets people with the condition track how long they are in a state of atrial fibrillation.\n\nApple has explored various business models for the watch, including one inspired by a practice that had worked for the company in the past. In the early days of the iPhone, Apple sold the devices to consumers at a discount, getting wireless carriers to cover the rest. Apple got paid full value, while the carriers were able to lock in consumers to long-term contracts for phone service. With its watch, Apple explored a similar arrangement: Health insurers would cover much or all of the price of the Apple Watch, hook consumers on their insurance plans and ultimately pay out less to doctors because the Apple health features would keep customers out of the hospital. Over the past several years, Apple has reached agreements with Aetna Inc. and UnitedHealthcare, but a number of other insurers turned down Apple\u2019s overtures, believing it would take too long to turn a profit on their investment.\n\nUnlike health-care leaders at some other technology companies, Williams is an engineering and operations expert, not a doctor. Much of Apple\u2019s health strategy, therefore, is led by Sumbul Desai, a physician turned health-care executive who was recruited by Williams in 2017 to come to Apple and manage its employee health clinics. Desai came from Stanford University, where she served as the associate chief medical officer and led a push into so-called digital-first primary care at the school\u2019s health-care system.\n\nApple had ambitions of building something similar. The concept, known within the company as Infinite Health, was for Apple to push into consumer medical care, building clinics across major cities and even within its retail stores, according to people with knowledge of the discussions. The clinics would feature the open spaces and clean lines of an Apple retail store and sleek equipment like the non-inflating blood-pressure cuff. Apple-employed doctors there would review data collected from the company\u2019s devices and fill in the gaps with standardized equipment.\n\nSome people at Apple envisioned the clinics as a way for the company to reinvent health care in the same way it revolutionized music players and phones. Apple even held acquisition talks with Crossover Health, which ran the onsite clinics where Apple employees could get care at work, as well as with the chain One Medical, which Amazon.com Inc. would buy for nearly $4 billion in 2023. \u201cWhat Amazon is doing now,\u201d said a person who worked on the project, \u201cis what we were really hoping we could do in an Apple-like way.\u201d\n\nWilliams pitched the consumer clinics idea to Cook many years ago, but the duo ultimately landed on a compromise: taking over the infrastructure and technology of the existing Apple employee clinics. The idea was to turn a corporate perk into a kind of health-care innovation lab and, in Silicon Valley vernacular, ask employees to eat the same dog food they were considering selling to their customers. \u201cThe thought process was, if we can\u2019t ship something good enough for our employees, no consumer will want this thing,\u201d said a person involved in the work. \u201cIt was a bit of a dogfooding exercise.\u201d\n\nThe dog food, however, was not great. The clinics in Silicon Valley, eventually relaunched by Desai under the name AC Wellness, provide adequate care, but they\u2019re extremely expensive to run. \u201cThere\u2019s no way any consumer or employer would ever pay what it takes Apple to run the clinics,\u201d said a person involved in their creation, given the high costs of the devices, salaries and the backend services to power the offering. \u201cIt\u2019s probably fine for a population of young and healthy employees, but you wouldn\u2019t want to run a Medicare Advantage plan with it,\u201d said someone else with knowledge of the clinics. Still, the broader Infinite Health concept for consumer clinics hasn\u2019t been completely abandoned.\n\nAnother dogfooding exercise was an app called HealthHabit, where users could chat with a care coordinator and then, if necessary, be routed to a medical professional. Doctors could answer simple questions such as, \u201cShould I take Advil for a hurt knee?\u201d but the service couldn\u2019t offer much in the way of new prescriptions or diagnoses. At the peak of its internal testing, HealthHabit only had about 3,500 users, out of a population of many tens of thousands at Apple offices in Silicon Valley. \u201cThis was the first real go at how you can have a physician in the loop during health care from Apple, and it was such a failure, it killed the vision,\u201d said a person involved in its development. Apple canceled an expansion to employees in Texas, and the app never made it to consumers. The company eventually repurposed some of the work for a new internal tool.\n\nAccording to multiple people who worked on that and other health initiatives, part of the problem has been the health team\u2019s leadership. One physician in the group, upon leaving at the end of 2019, sent a scathing email to Cook and Williams reviewed by Bloomberg that describes a workplace characterized by \u201cauthoritarian rule through intimidation and fierce retribution for not marching in line.\u201d In addition to complaints like these, physicians have criticized executives for offering up erroneous medical information in meetings and then upbraiding colleagues who contradicted them.\n\nAt a product event in September, the company didn\u2019t make as much noise as usual about health. It released a mental health feature for the iPhone and Apple Watch that allows a user to log how they are feeling throughout the day and a mechanism that warns users against holding their devices too close to their eyes for long periods of time.\n\nIn a sense, the fate of the blood glucose sensor will be a sign of how willing the company is to move beyond the worried well into the kingdom of the sick. Some involved in Apple\u2019s health efforts don\u2019t believe the company will leverage its future blood sugar checker on the Apple Watch as a medical device for people who already have diabetes \u2014 because of regulatory concerns and technology limitations that could create the risk of giving a patient an incorrect result.\n\nStill, senior executives and board members at the company point out that preventing millions of people from getting diabetes in the first place is an enormous accomplishment. \u201cThe goal is not only to fix the prick problem,\u201d said someone who has been briefed on the work by one of its leaders, \u201cbut to change the global problem of diabetes.\u201d Apple, in other words, is still thinking big. \u2014With Ike Swetlitz\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWorld\u2019s Safest Market Becomes a Magnet for Big Investors How Drug Cartels Transformed Ecuador Into a \u2018Narco State\u2019 Is This Poop-Test Startup Just Wellness Theater?
