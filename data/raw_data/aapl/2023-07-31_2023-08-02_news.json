Japanese stocks were among the worst performers for the day, with the Nikkei 225 index sliding 1.6%, while the broader TOPIX fell 1.2%. Local stocks were hit by a mix of profit taking, as well as uncertainty over the Bank of Japan\u2019s stance on its ultra-dovish monetary policy.\n\nAustralia\u2019s ASX 200 fell 0.5% as data showed that the country\u2019s trade surplus remained steady in June. Australian retail sales also fell less than expected in the second quarter.\n\nFutures for India\u2019s Nifty 50 index pointed to a slightly positive open, after the index plummeted from record highs this week. High weightage of technology stocks weighed heavily on the Nifty and the BSE Sensex 30 in recent sessions.\n\nStory continues\n\nChinese stocks limit losses as PMI data signals some strength\n\nChina\u2019s Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 and Shanghai Composite indexes fell less than their peers on Thursday, as a private survey showed that the country\u2019s services sector grew more than expected in July.\n\nThe reading indicated that steady retail spending and services demand was still keeping some facets of Chinese business activity afloat, and could help support a bigger economic recovery this year, especially if the government rolls out more stimulus measures.\n\nBut investors appear to have somewhat soured on the prospect of more Chinese stimulus, given that officials have offered up few details on how the measures will be carried out. The country's biggest economic engines - manufacturing and real estate - are also struggling despite promises of more support.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAsian stocks fall as risk-off persists after U.S. rating cut\n\nBMW sees solid revenue growth in first half\n\nSingapore bank DBS' Q2 profit beats estimates; expects record year", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/asian-stocks-fall-risk-off-234903648.html", "symbols": ["AAPL.US", "AMZN.US", "HSI.INDX"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.992, "neg": 0.046, "neu": 0.826, "pos": 0.127}}, {"date": "2023-08-02T21:35:50+00:00", "title": "Could Apple and the Pac-12 be teaming up?", "content": "Pac-12 commissioner George Kliavkoff presented leaders of Pac-12 schools with an exclusive streaming deal with Apple, according to ESPN. Yahoo Finance Live discusses the potential deal's impact on Pac-12 and Apple.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nJOSH SCHAFER: I do want to move on to a different last frontier when we're talking about another tech company that's also reporting earnings tomorrow. So we have Apple earnings out tomorrow. And in my opinion, at least in the streaming space, the last frontier for Apple is sports. And we got a new headline out in the last 24 hours, Pete Thamel over ESPN saying that the Pac-12 has now presented. So President George-- Commissioner George Kulikov has now presented a deal to the Pac-12 teams that would allow them to be the-- Apple be the exclusive streamer when they resign their deal after this year.\n\nNow, this comes as the Pac-12 has been losing teams. USC, UCLA, major name brand schools are going to be gone in a year. Oregon might be leaving. Colorado has left already and announced that they're leaving. So Pac-12, a little bit looking for something some good news here. But it'd be interesting, Seana, to me, to see Apple pair up with a college conference and a smaller college conference at that. It reminds me more of that MLS deal. They're not getting the SEC. You get Pac-12 football. You know, a little bit of a smaller audience, you can sort of test things out, see how football goes for you.\n\nSEANA SMITH: Yeah. And you know, you kind of took the words out of my mouth, because I was going to draw that exact same comparison, right? They're getting into college football. They're getting that exposure. They're going for a smaller league, not one that's going to cost them nearly as much. So they get their footprint. They get some exposure there.\n\nWhether or not it's a good deal for Pac-12, that's also been debated out there, although we don't have to go all the way in to college football here. But when it comes to Apple's play into sports, clearly, if they're looking at college football, we can see that they envisioned sports becoming a bigger part of their streaming offering. And where that goes from here in terms of professional sports, other larger college conferences, that's going to be the thing to watch.\n\nStory continues\n\nBROOKE DIPALMA: Yeah. And speaking of that impact on Pac-12, if I read this right, Josh, I mean, Apple does not produce the games. So what does this ultimately mean for the cost to Pac-12? ? Will this investment, you know, this partnership be worth it to them at the end of the day? Or will it end up eating into their bottom line? I mean--\n\nJOSH SCHAFER: It'd be interesting to see how it plays out, right? I think that really what it would probably do hopefully, at least for Apple, would be just get more subscribers, right? It's just getting more premium subscribers. And then I think when you think about the overall vision for Apple, and one thing I'm excited to maybe hear about on that earnings call tomorrow, is what happens with the Vision Pro headset and what the full vision is there, because it's been really interesting to me to hear Bob Iger talk about that Vision Pro headset.\n\nAnd Bob Iger is looking for things to do with ESPN. And you've talked about watching an NBA game on that Vision Pro headset. When you start to get broadcast deals, you can do alternative broadcasts. You can play with that headset. If you're going to sell a VR headset, VR/AR headset for $3,500, put me on the field. Let's do something cool with it.\n\nAnd I don't think that they're necessarily going to talk about that tomorrow, right? But they are going to talk about the future of Vision Pro and where they're going with it. And I think to see them build out that streaming product and have more pieces of content to put in the headset is part of the story.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/video/could-apple-pac-12-teaming-213550169.html", "symbols": ["AAPL.MX", "AAPL.US", "AAPL34.SA", "APC.F", "APC.XETRA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.989, "neg": 0.009, "neu": 0.914, "pos": 0.077}}, {"date": "2023-08-02T19:54:02+00:00", "title": "Dow futures lift, Paypal dips 6.8% after earnings", "content": "Investing.com - U.S. stock futures were trading higher during Wednesday's evening deals, following a negative session among major benchmark indices as Fitch's recent long-term credit downgrade of the United States soured sentiment.\n\nBy 7:15pm ET (11:15pm GMT) Dow Jones Futures and Nasdaq 100 Futures were up 0.2% while S&P 500 Futures ticked 0.1% higher.\n\nIn extended deals, PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) lost 6.8% after the company reported Q2 EPS of $1.16 versus $1.15 expected, while revenues were reported at $7.29B versus estimates of $7.27B.

One is to follow the advice of Ben Graham, the father of value investing, using his classic book, The Intelligent Investor.\n\nGraham suggests that a defensive investor should buy stocks of large, conservatively financed companies with good earnings power. The companies should also be some of the best dividend stocks, with consistent histories of payouts, and have low valuations.\n\nHowever, in today's world, many tech stocks don't pay dividends. Instead, they often return capital to shareholders through large stock buybacks.\n\nTherefore, applying Graham's criteria today, the idea is to find the best stocks to buy that return large amounts of capital to shareholders either through dividends and/or stock buybacks.\n\nThis allows a company to increase its earnings and dividends on a per-share basis. Moreover, the remaining shareholder's stakes rise over time. Both of these factors can push the stock higher.\n\nAnother Graham criteria is to find stocks with a low valuation. The S&P 500 has a relatively high price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 31.4 times over the last 10 years. This article will focus on stocks with price-to-earnings ratios that are lower than the broad market.\n\nLastly, we will stick with stocks that have market caps of $100 billion or higher. They must also have low debt ratios and enough cash flow to reduce their debt, as well as pay dividends and/or buybacks.\n\nWith this in mind, here are the nine of the best long-term investment stocks to buy now.\n\nWhat Is a Stock Buyback?\n\nData is as of Aug. 1. Dividend yields are calculated by annualizing the most recent payout and dividing by the share price.\n\nMarket value: $3.08 trillion Dividend yield: 0.5%\n\nApple (AAPL, $195.60) is the $3 trillion maker of iPhone smartphones, Mac computers, iPads and numerous other products and services.\n\nStory continues\n\niPhones still represent over half of the company's sales, but recently services, which includes the App Store, have started to increase as well. For example, in its latest quarter ending April 1, Apple's services revenue came in at $20.9 billion, or 22% of its $94.8 billion in sales. That is up from 20% a year ago and 18.9% two years ago.\n\nSo, this massive tech products company is slowly shedding its overreliance on the iPhone, whose models are all very highly priced. While this will take time, the market so far approves of this plan.\n\nAnd why not? The company is generating massive amounts of free cash flow (FCF), which is the money left over after a company covers expenses to run, maintain and expand the business. Last quarter, Apple said it generated strong operating cash flow of $28.6 billion, while returning over $23 billion to shareholders.\n\nApple pays a small dividend, which it recently raised by 4% to 96 cents annually. That gives the stock a low 0.5% dividend yield. However, this cost the company just $3.7 billion, or 13% of its operating flow.\n\nThe rest of the $23 billion \"returned\" to shareholders was through stock buybacks. In fact, Apple raised the amount it says it will spend this year on share repurchases to $90 billion. That represents over 3.3% of its total market value.\n\nThis will benefit long-term shareholders in Apple stock. First, it will raise AAPL's earnings per share over time through having a lower number of shares outstanding for the income it produces.\n\nBut in addition, the dividend per share can rise faster than it would otherwise since the dividend payments will be spread over fewer number of shares outstanding. And a third effect will be the soaking up of shares traded in the market \u2013 effectively acting as a buying source in the market, pushing the blue chip stock higher.\n\nKeep in mind that APPL stock is not overly cheap at the moment, at 28.7 times forward earnings \u2013 above its five-year average of 23.7, according to Morningstar. However, it is about below the S&P 500's average, as mentioned earlier.\n\nNevertheless, Apple remains one of the best long-term investment stocks due to its consistent and powerful cash flow, dividends and buybacks.\n\nBest Dividend ETFs to Buy Now\n\nMarket value: $2.50 trillion Dividend yield: 0.8%\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT, $336.34) operates in every key software arena: operating systems, cloud, gaming, application software, and even artificial intelligence (AI) with its new Bing chatbot.\n\nMSFT meets all the necessary qualities for being one of the best long-term investment stocks as it has consistent earnings, is conservatively financed and generates large amounts of free cash flow. Moreover, it pays a dividend and spends most of its FCF on share buybacks.\n\nJust like Apple, however, MSFT stock is not necessarily cheap on a relative or even historical basis. For example, Microsoft is trading at 30.4 times forward earnings, which is above its five-year average of 28.6. Still, it's below the S&P 500's long-term average.\n\nAnd long-term investors are likely to do quite well with MSFT. The reasons are quite simple: The company's massive cash flow, its products ubiquity and acceptance, and its shareholder rewards are all working in the stock's favor.\n\nFor example, Microsoft recently reported a 21% year-over-year increase in fiscal fourth-quarter earnings per share, while revenue was up 8%. Plus, free cash flow was up 12% from the year prior.\n\nBut more importantly, the company has plenty of room to increase its shareholder-friendly initiatives over time. This is because it spends just about half its free cash flow on dividends and buybacks. It plows the rest back into the company, reducing debt and making investments and acquisitions.\n\nSo, in the long run, Microsoft shareholders can expect the company to typically grow profits and cash flow, while consistently hiking its dividends and buybacks. In fact, Microsoft has had 18 consecutive years of raising its dividend. That alone, not counting its buybacks and earnings power, makes the Dow Jones stock worthy of holding as a long-term investment.\n\nHow to Invest in AI\n\nMarket value: $303.4 billion Dividend yield: 3.7%\n\nChevron (CVX, $162.30) is an integrated energy and chemicals company with both upstream and downstream operations in the U.S. and around the world.\n\nCVX meets the criteria for a good long-term investment as it is conservatively financed, produces good profits and pays an attractive dividend it can afford. Moreover, CVX stock is not expensive and the company is actively buying back shares, helping to push it higher.\n\nFor example, analysts expect Chevron to make $11.94 per share in fiscal 2023, which has the energy stock trading at 13.6 times forward earnings. This is well below the five-year average of 37.9 times.\n\nMoreover, Chevron has 36 years of annual dividend hikes under its belt. This is because despite vicissitudes in the prices of oil and gas and chemical industry cycles, the company has consistently produced large amounts of free cash flow.\n\nFor example, in Q2, Chevron generated $9.4 billion in operating cash flow before working capital changes, and $2.5 billion in free cash flow. The company spent $2.8 billion on dividends and $4.4 billion on share buybacks, for a record $7.2 billion in total shareholder returns.\n\nThis shows how Chevron manages a fair balance between investing in the future, as well as rewarding its own shareholders now with its cash flow. And it underscores why CVX is the kind of stock that long-term investors want to have in their portfolio.\n\nStocks With the Highest Dividend Yields in the S&P 500\n\nMarket value: $116.7 billion Dividend yield: 3.2%\n\nMedtronic (MDT, $87.68) is a $117 billion medical device and therapies company that originally invented the pacemaker. That is probably relatable to people who are looking for the best retirement stocks. Moreover, the company is extremely profitable, which allows it to pay generous dividends and do large share buybacks.\n\nRight now, MDT stock has a 3.2% dividend yield. And this yield will likely continue to rise, given the company has reliably raised its dividend for 46 straight years \u2013 including a 1.5% hike in May.\n\nMoreover, in fiscal 2023, which ended on April 28, Medtronic bought back $645 million of its shares. That works out to be about 55% of one percent of its $117 billion market cap.\n\nThat is not much, but every little bit helps towards allowing the company to keep raising its dividend.\n\nIn addition, at just 17.1 times forward earnings, the stock is inexpensive. What's more, this is well below MDT's five-year average of 19.1 times, according to Morningstar.\n\nMeanwhile, Medtronic has about $17 billion in net debt on its balance sheet. This is well below its $52 billion in shareholders' equity. Its cash flow should continue to recover from supply chain issues we've seen in the past few years. That will allow Medtronic to reduce its debt reliance over time.\n\nAnd given its powerful cash flow and shareholder returns, MDT is one of the best long-term investment stocks.\n\nBull Markets vs Bear Markets: The Differences Explained\n\nMarket value: $119.6 billion Dividend yield: 1.5%\n\nCharles Schwab (SCHW, $65.72) is a well-known discount brokerage firm and investment banking company with which many baby boomers are familiar.\n\nSCHW meets all the best criteria for a long-term investment value strategy. For example, it is conservatively financed, pays a consistent dividend with a 1.5% yield, and has a low valuation.\n\nAs for that dividend, Schwab has had 34 years of consistently paying its dividend each year. That is well over the 10-year average of the median in its sector.\n\nMoreover, Schwab recently reported that its return on equity was 20% in the six months ended June 30, up from 15% in the year-ago period. This indicates a substantial rebound in its earnings power. It also allays concerns that the bank might have been hurt by investors worried about a potential recession.\n\nMeanwhile, the financial stock is trading at 17.2 times forward earnings, well below its five-year average of 18.6.\n\nWhile the company did recently decide to pause its share buyback program in light of uncertainty in the financial sector following the spring banking crisis. This is likely to reverse once the Federal Reserve stops pushing interest rates higher, which could act as a major catalyst.\n\nInvesting Jargon, Explained\n\nMarket value: $212.5 billion Dividend yield: 2.1%\n\nMcDonald's (MCD, $291.07) is a company that just about every investor knows well, especially if they have children. But few realize that it is actually quite a good long-term investment stock to buy as well.\n\nThe main reason is that the company generates large amounts of free cash flow. For example, in the last 12 months (LTM) ending March 31, MCD produced $5.7 billion in FCF. That represents 2.7% of its $212 billion market capitalization.\n\nMCD uses its free cash flow to pay a very ample dividend, which now yields 2.1%. In addition, it bought back almost $3 billion of its shares over the last year.\n\nWhile some folks might not like MCD's quick service restaurant food, plenty of others do. They love its menu, buy McDonald's fries and hamburgers and generally can't get enough of its food.\n\nMoreover, it is conservatively financed as its $37 billion in long-term debt, $33.3 billion after cash, is well-managed by the company's ongoing FCF generation.\n\nIn addition, shareholders have benefited by its history of annually raising its dividend over the last 46 years.\n\nAlong with its buybacks, MCD stock is attractively valued. For example, it trades for just 26.8 times earnings. While certainly not cheap, this is below its five-year average\n\nThe bottom line \u2013 everyone is \"lovin\" MCD stock for the long term.\n\nStock Picks That Billionaires Love\n\nMarket value: $368.3 billion Dividend yield: 2.4%\n\nProcter & Gamble (PG, $156.25) is a nearly $370 billion consumer products giant with many iconic brand names \u2013 including Downy detergent, Mr. Clean cleaning supplies and Head & Shoulders shampoo \u2013 that produce large amounts of cash flow for the company.\n\nMost everyone knows Procter & Gamble's brands and are familiar with their solid reputations. But few realize how incredibly profitable the company actually is and why PG is one of the best long-term investment stocks to buy.\n\nFor example, in the last 12 months ended June 30, PG generated $15.2 billion in operating cash and after $3.0 billion in capex spending, $12.2 billion in free cash flow.\n\nThe FCF represents a massive 15% of P&G's $81 billion LTM sales, which is a very high free cash flow margin for a consumer products company. In fact, some software companies don't even make those kinds of margins.\n\nMoreover, this FCF also funds massive dividends and buybacks for shareholders. The company has raised its dividend annually for the last 66 years. Moreover, in its recent earnings call, Procter and Gamble management said it expects to buy back $5 billion to $6 billion in common stock this fiscal year. That represents about 1.5% of its market capitalization.\n\nNevertheless, PG is not expensive relative to its historical valuation. It trades for just 26.5 times earnings, which is well below its five-year average of 35.0.\n\nIn other words, Procter & Gamble is reasonably priced, generates large amounts of cash flow from its brands and is working diligently to return value to shareholders. That makes it one of the best long-term investments value buyers can make.\n\nBest Defensive ETFs to Protect Your Portfolio\n\nMarket value: $61.0 billion Dividend yield: 5.4%\n\n3M (MMM, $110.56) is a $61 billion industrial conglomerate that operates in four sectors: safety and industrial; transportation and electronics; healthcare; and consumer. The company's mission is to apply science to improve people's lives daily.\n\nBut MMM is also one of the best long-term investment stocks for folks to own. For example, 3M generated $1.5 billion in free cash flow in the second quarter, and returned $800 million to shareholders via dividends.\n\nOn top of that, 3M buys back its common stock, with the company repurchasing $1.4 billion of its own shares in 2022.\n\nGiven its free cash flow, investors can take comfort in knowing that MMM's $6.00 annual dividend, which yields an attractive 5.4%, is probably secure.\n\nPlus, 3M stock is cheap, trading at just 11.6 times forward earnings, well below its five-year average of 16.6.\n\nMoreover, 3M is conservatively financed. The company reported $11.7 billion in net debt at the end of Q2, which was down 12% on a year-over-year basis.\n\nGiven its strong cash flow, dividends, buybacks, low valuation and financing, the industrial stock looks like a good long-term investment for value buyers.\n\nStocks Warren Buffett Is Buying and Selling\n\nMarket value: $267.1 billion Dividend yield: 3.0%\n\nCoca-Cola (KO, $61.77) is an iconic beverage company that generates large amounts of cash flow for its shareholders with its well-known brands such as Coke, Diet Coke, Fanta, Powerade and Minute Maid.\n\nThat makes it one of the best long term investments a value buyer can make \u2013 just ask Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) holding company is KO's top shareholder. What makes KO so attractive is that it is one of the best dividend stocks on Wall Street, having increased its payouts consistently for the last 60 years straight. Most recently, Coca-Cola in February hiked its dividend by nearly 5%.\n\nToday, KO stock yields an attractive 3%, and investors can expect the dividend rate to keep increasing.\n\nOn top of that, Coca-Cola has a strong common stock buyback program. For example, in the last 12 months ended June 30, it spent $872 million on share repurchases. That represents 33% of 1.0% of its $267 billion market value.\n\nKO's dividends and share buybacks are more than covered by $9.5 billion in FCF that management expects to generate during 2023.\n\nOn top of that, the consumer staples stock is trading at 25.6 times earnings, well below its five-year average of 32.1.\n\nSo, for the long term-investor, KO stock looks like a good investment, given its strong cash flows and shareholder-friendly initiatives.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/best-long-term-investment-stocks-172831591.html", "symbols": ["2M6.F", "2M6.XETRA", "AAPL.MX", "AAPL.US", "AAPL34.SA", "APC.F", "APC.XETRA", "CHV.F", "CHV.XETRA", "CVX.MX", "CVX.US", "MCD.MX", "MCD.US", "MCDC34.SA", "MDO.F", "MDO.XETRA", "MDT.US", "MSF.F", "MSF.XETRA", "MSFT.MX"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 1, "neg": 0.023, "neu": 0.805, "pos": 0.172}}, {"date": "2023-08-02T16:45:05+00:00", "title": "Jim Rogers\u2019s Latest Predictions and Investments", "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at Jim Rogers's latest predictions and investments. If you want to see more predictions and investments in this selection, check out\u00a0Jim Rogers's 5 Latest Predictions and Investments.\n\nThe stock market has been on an impressive run, depicted by the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 posting double-digit gains and recouping all the losses accrued last year. The remarkable run comes after the market suffered a bear run in 2022 fueled by inflationary pressures, deteriorating economic conditions, and Federal Reserve's aggressive push to hike interest rates. According to legendary investor Jim Rogers who co-founded Quantum Fund with George Soros, investors should be extremely cautious as the next downturn could be more painful.\n\nWhile the market appears to be in a bull run, everything always comes to an end, as equities cannot move up forever. The fact that the current bull run appears to be fueled by a small clique of tech giants, including Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), also raises serious concerns about the sustainability of the bull run.\n\nOne of the factors likely to trigger a correction into the bear territory is the extreme debt levels. According to the legendary investor, too much debt does not bode well with investors.\n\n\"[In] 2008, we had a bear market because of too much debt,\" he said. \"Look out the window since 2008, debt everywhere has skyrocketed,\u201d said Rogers in an interview with real Vision\n\nWhile not as popular as George Soros, Jim Rogers rose to prominence as he helped steer Quantum Fund into generating 4,200% returns between 1973 and 1980 outperforming S&P 500's 47% gains. He retired at the age of 37 after making so much money that he would never need to work again. After parting ways with Soros in 1980, Rogers spent most of his time travelling on a motorcycle around the world covering over 160,000 km over six contents.\n\nStory continues\n\nAfter retiring with abundant wealth, he pursued diverse interests, becoming an educator, traveling the world, and authoring several best-selling books. Rogers' investment approach involves focusing on specific countries, commodities, or themes he believes hold profit potential. While his current holdings are not publicly disclosed, he has expressed caution in buying new assets and has mentioned owning commodities, particularly gold and silver.\n\nJim Roger\u2019s net worth is believed to stand at about $300 million. He has been investing privately since leaving Quantum Fund in 1980 but does not disclose his holdings. Despite being out of the limelight for many years his experience and insights about the markets is always looked upon. Jim Rogers, often dubbed the Indiana Jones of the investing world, has a penchant for globetrotting in search of cost-effective investment opportunities.\n\nRogers, now living in Singapore with his family, made it clear that he was not buying anything as he expects bad times at the start of the year. According to the legendary investor, the next bear market will be the worst in the lifetime, exacerbated by debt that has increased too much over the past 15 years. The remarks draw up parrels to the economic conditions leading up to the devastating 2009 financial crisis. Jim Rogers's Latest Predictions and Investments\n\nTo support the predictions, the 80-year-old investors draw parallels from the inflationary crisis of 1980. Following that crisis, policymakers pursued a vigorous tightening of monetary policy, implementing substantial interest rate hikes, raising them to 21%, and pushing treasury yields to astronomical levels in an effort to counter high inflation. The outcome was the United States economy being thrust into a recession, causing significant turmoil in the stock market.\n\nWith the scenario unfolding in today\u2019s financial markets, investors ought to be extremely cautious even as the market appears to be in a strong uptrend. Rogers is already predicting trouble across all the markets, from property to stocks to bonds and currencies.\n\nJim Rogers' warning of a bear market cannot be taken lightly, given his experience in leveraging market volatility as his advantage. In partnership with George Soros, he founded Quantum Funds in 1973 and navigated the fund through multiple market downturns and economic crises.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nRogers believes it is high time investors and individuals remain vigilant and assess the risk exposure. The high debt levels and resemblance to previous crises should always be a stark reminder that market conditions can deteriorate instantly. Likewise, we have compiled Rogers biggest predictions and investment ideas from multiple sources.\n\n10. Biggest Bear Market Run of a lifetime\n\nPrediction: June 2022\n\nBest known for his contrarian investment strategy that emphasizes long-term trends, Rogers believes the world is staring at the ferocious bear run of a lifetime. In June of 2022 Rogers made that claim that the prevailing economic conditions resembled the period leading to the great financial crisis of 2008.\n\nUnlike in the past crisis, the current situation is exacerbated by extreme debt levels following the massive stimulus packages at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. The debt levels have already fueled a stubborn inflationary pressure that refuses to go away. With the FED insisting on hiking interest rates until inflation tanks below 2%, it spells more doom for an economy trying to bounce back from the COVID-19-fueled slowdown.\n\n\u201cSince 2008, the debt everywhere has skyrocketed. Gigantic increases in debt \u2026 So, I think it\u2019s a simple statement that the next bear market will be the worst in my lifetime. Because the debt has gone up by such staggering amounts in the past 14 years,\u201d Jim Rogers said in a statement.\n\n9. Governments Exacerbate Crypto Risks\n\nPrediction: August 2022\n\nAccording to the legendary investor, the biggest risk to cryptocurrencies is the government. The government wants to control everything, so they will always do everything within its power to ensure cryptocurrencies don\u2019t succeed. In August of 2022, Rogers reiterated that he will not invest in crypto even though\u00a0 his wife was a big fan and had invested in then.\n\n\u201cIf and when all our money is on our computer, it\u2019s going to be government money,\u201d he said in a recent interview with Bloomberg Crypto. \u201cThat\u2019s not the way bureaucrats think. That\u2019s not the way politicians think. They want control. They want to regulate everything.\u201d\n\nRogers does not expect the world to convert to Bitcoin or adopt cryptocurrencies as it has been touted in many circles. Even though digital assets live in the computer, it will always be government computer money, given the kind of regulations always in play.\n\nThe remarks echo the stringent regulatory scrutiny that has seen many governments try to curtail the mining and trading of cryptocurrencies. China has been at the forefront of regulations significantly hurting cryptos' sentiments and prospects.\n\nLikewise, the governments have sought to foster the development of central bank-powered decentralized cryptocurrencies that they will always be in a position to control, unlike normal cryptocurrencies.\n\n8. Inflation Will Persist for Long\n\nPrediction: September 2022\n\nThe US Federal Reserve has hiked interest rates at the fastest pace to highs of 5.5%. In the process, they have succeeded in pushing inflation from four-decade highs of 9.2% to about 3%. In September if last year Rogers reiterated inflationary pressures are far from over, even as the FED embarked on aggressive monetary tightening.\n\nAccording to Rogers inflation problem will only go away partially because governments have printed so much money in recent years. Therefore, even if it has come down significantly, it still needs to be finished.\n\nThe legendary investor has warned that a move by the central banks to hike interest rates in the race to address the inflation problem could end up being catastrophic. For starters, it could be the trigger that will end up tipping the economy into recession.\n\n7. Recession is Inevitable and going to be Bad\n\nPrediction: October 2022\n\nDue to the high inflation environment, the economy will not avoid recession, according to Jim Rogers. The fact that it has been the longest time in history that the US has struggled with serious problems heightens the prospect of the economy plunging into recession.\n\nWhile the recession might have already started, according to Rogers, it\u2019s not been bad because there have been some good things along the way. However, things are likely to turn out for the worst as debt has gone up so much over the past 15 years.\n\n6. Agriculture Key to Fighting Inflation and Recession\n\nPrediction: October 2022\n\nWhile the focus has been on emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, and cryptocurrencies, Rogers insists that agriculture will always be key. While agriculture might not seem as exciting as revolutionary technologies, it will always be an essential part of the economy and society.\n\nTherefore, Rogers believes agriculture is yet to gain the traction it deserves in the global economy, therefore, providing interesting and significant investment opportunities.\n\n\"Agriculture has been a disaster for years,\"\u00a0he said. \"And usually, if you buy a disaster, things turn out OK.\"\n\nGiven the consistent demand for food, even on soaring inflation or recession, agriculture will always provide opportunities for growth and diversification of investment portfolios. In addition, rogers believe investors should always pay close watch to housing since food and shelter are part of basic human needs.\n\nClick to continue reading and see Jim Rogers's 5 Latest Predictions and Investments.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n10 Best Rated Penny Stocks to Buy According to Analysts Billionaire Jeff Vinik's Stock Picks and 10-Year Performance 10 Stock Market Forecasts Next 6 Months\n\nDisclosure: None.\u00a0Jim Rogers's Latest Predictions and Investments is originally published on Insider Monkey.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jim-rogers-latest-predictions-investments-164505980.html", "symbols": ["AAPL.US", "AMZN.US", "GOOGL.US", "GSPC.INDX", "META.US", "MSFT.US", "NVDA.US"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": -0.997, "neg": 0.119, "neu": 0.798, "pos": 0.083}}, {"date": "2023-08-02T15:54:00+00:00", "title": "Will Slowing Services Growth Hurt Apple's (AAPL) Q3 Earnings?", "content": "Apple\u2019s AAPL third-quarter fiscal 2023 results, to be reported on Aug 3, are expected to reflect the impacts of the sluggishness in the Services business.\r\n\r\nThe segment, which includes revenues from the App Store, Apple Music, iCloud, Apple Arcade, Apple TV+, Apple News+ and Apple Card, accounted for 22% of sales in second-quarter fiscal 2023.\r\n\r\nAlthough Apple\u2019s business primarily runs around its flagship iPhone, the Services portfolio has emerged as the company\u2019s new cash cow.\r\n\r\nApple had more than 975 million paid subscribers across its Services portfolio at the end of the fiscal second quarter.

This article will cover recent employment and labor market trends and look at highly rewarding companies that recruit fresh graduates. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, go directly to the 5 Countries with the Highest Starting Salaries for Graduates.\n\nThe Global Labor Market: An Overview\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic not only brought distress to the physical health of the global population, but it left the world with a financial burden to recover from. Labor shortages, rising global inflation rates and unemployment rates, productivity constraints, and declining quality of work are some of the pandemic-induced crises. The International Labor Organization suggests that the global employment rate will only increase by 1% in 2023. The report further states that young adults and fresh graduates are increasingly finding it difficult to settle for a job. Over 1 of every 5 young adults are neither employed nor in education.\n\nExperts also raise eyebrows about the declining productivity and quality of work. According to the World Economic Forum, as of 2022, three in ten manufacturing and service companies in Europe reported declining productivity. The United States reported 70% of the job openings as unfilled in retail and wholesale, 55% in manufacturing, and 45% in the leisure and hospitality industry.\n\nWhile COVID-19 shook global economic roots, the pandemic fueled the otherwise steadily growing technology industry. Big data analytics and artificial intelligence have been one of the fastest-growing industries globally.\n\nAccording to a report by Fortune Business Insights, the global big data analytics industry was valued at $271.83 billion in 2022. The global big data analytics industry is expected to reach a valuation of $745.15 billion by 2030 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.5%. The big data analytics industry is dominated by North American companies, followed by countries in the Asia Pacific notably China, India, South Korea, Singapore, and Japan. Major players in the industry are International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), SAP SE (NYSE:SAP), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to a report by Fortune Business Insights, the Global artificial intelligence (AI) industry was valued at $428 billion in 2022. The Global Artificial Intelligence (AI) industry is expected to grow to a valuation of $2.025 trillion by 2030, at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 21.6%.\n\nAs of November 2022, ChatGPT, the popular AI software gained over a million users in just five days after its official launch. Moreover, as of February 2023, Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU), a Chinese multinational technology company, launched its official AI chatbot. Additionally, big data giants like International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) acquired Dialexa, a product engineering services firm, in September 2022. The acquiring company, International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM),\u00a0 intended to integrate the use of technology to automate operations and enhance customer service. Such showcases the need to integrate technology and automate business solutions to compete globally.\n\nArtificial intelligence is used mostly within retail, IT, telecom, healthcare, advertising and media, manufacturing, and the automotive industry. North America dominates the artificial intelligence industry. As per the report, almost 80% of businesses based in the United States were optimistic and enthusiastic about the integration of AI in their businesses.\n\nWhile North America dominated the market share of the global AI industry in 2022, the Asia Pacific region is forecasted to grow at the fastest rate over the coming years, followed by emerging markets including Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa.\n\nIs AI Expected to Take Over the Labor Market?\n\nAccording to the World Economic Forum, 75% of companies are leaping through technological advancements. Big data, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence are notable technologies altering the economic landscape by enabling digital trade and e-commerce. Within the next five years, 86% of companies worldwide are expected to integrate digital platforms and apps into their business operations. Additionally, 74.9% of companies are expected to adapt to artificial intelligence by 2027.\n\nThe incidence of artificial intelligence alters the labor market landscape entirely. Artificial intelligence is changing how jobs are being done, and how people create content for their businesses and sell their commodities. According to the World Economic Forum report we cited above, thanks to generative AI, 19% of the workforce could have 50% of their workload automated. Moreover, 34% of human tasks in organizations are already being performed by machines or robots.\n\nOne can argue that the existence of AI may cost millions of people their jobs and household income. However, the key takeaway with AI being able to perform tasks could be the ability to set up businesses from the comfort of your homes without having to employ an army of workers. The real question stands, is AI stealing jobs or is it changing the economic landscape of the world for good?\n\nNotable Companies Popular Amongst Graduates\n\nLanding a well-paying job as a fresh graduate is a daunting experience. However, some companies have student and fresh graduate-friendly policies. Some of these companies are Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Apple Inc.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) with a salary package of $60753/annum. The news comes as a surprise to the incoming labor force. While it is true that big names like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) hire fresh graduates, there has been little information on the internet about the company hiring non-engineering students for a level 1 job at the company. Such explains the attraction towards working at Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) by students from all industries.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is another huge name in the global industry.

But there are several \u201cbig\u201d earnings reports that everyone will be tuning into, including two of the Magnificent 7, Amazon and Apple.\n\nApple, Amazon and these 3 other companies are among the most popularly held by investors. All 5 have seen big rallies in 2023. None are \u201ccheap\u201d by a forward P/E basis but do investors care? It seems like valuation is irrelevant in 2023.\n\nIn addition, several of these stocks have great earnings surprise track records. Will another beat provide a catalyst to push these stocks even higher?\n\nApple, Amazon and 3 Other Key Earnings Charts\n\n1. Apple Inc. (AAPL) has an outstanding earnings surprise track record with just 1 miss in the last 5 years. It happened in early 2023 but that didn\u2019t stop shares of Apple from rallying throughout 2023. Apple has hit new all-time highs this year and is up 50.6%. Apple is expensive, from what it has traded at historically. It has a forward P/E of 32.6. Does its valuation keep you out of Apple?\n\n2. Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) has put together 2 big beats in a row but has always had a hit-or-miss earnings surprise track record. Shares of Amazon have rallied big, gaining 57% year-to-date. Amazon is not cheap. It trades at 85.4x. But it has never been cheap, even after big sell-offs like last year. Is Amazon still undervalued?\n\n3. Booking Holdings, Inc. (BKNG) has beat 10 quarters in a row. That\u2019s an impressive record for a travel company during the pandemic. Shares of Booking are up 44.6% year-to-date. It\u2019s the cheapest of these 5 companies with a forward P/E of 22. Booking is trading near its all-time highs. Will Booking break out on this report?\n\n4. Airbnb, Inc. (ABNB) has beat 8 quarters in a row. If you recall, Airbnb was a pandemic IPO. It went public in late 2020. Shares of Airbnb have rallied this year, gaining 74%. Airbnb isn\u2019t cheap either, with a forward P/E of 44.3. With travel so hot, should Airbnb be on your shortlist?\n\nStory continues\n\n5. DraftKings Inc. (DKNG) is coming off a miss last quarter, but prior to that miss, it had beat 5 quarters in a row. Shares of DraftKings have soared 179% year-to-date. DraftKings doesn\u2019t have a P/E because it\u2019s expected to lose $1.81 per share this year but that is an improvement from its loss of $3.16 last year. Will this earnings report be a further catalyst for DraftKings\u2019 shares?\n\n[In full disclosure, Tracey owns shares of AMZN and BKNG in her personal portfolio.]\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Meanwhile, Amazon has climbed about 57% this year. The movement of the stocks over the next few days will depend on their earnings. Let\u2019s delve into them (read: Take a Bite of These ETFs on Historic Apple's $3T Valuation).\r\n\r\nAccording to our methodology, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nApple\n\nApple has an Earnings ESP of +0.66% and a Zacks Rank #3. Apple saw positive earnings estimate revision of a penny over the past 30 days for the fiscal third quarter. Analysts raising estimates right before earnings \u2014 with the most up-to-date information possible \u2014 is a good indicator for the stock. The iPhone maker has a strong track record of positive earnings surprise. It delivered an average earnings surprise of 2.65% in the trailing four quarters.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates a modest year-over-year decrease of 0.8% for earnings and 2% for revenues (see: all the Technology ETFs here).\r\n\r\nThe stock belongs to a top-ranked Zacks Industry (top 43%) and has a solid Growth Score of B. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the average target price is $197.22, with nearly 76% of the analysts giving a Strong Buy or a Buy rating ahead of the company\u2019s earnings.\r\n\r\nAmazon\r\n\r\nAmazon has an Earnings ESP of +2.99% and a Zacks Rank #3. The stock saw no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days for the second quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates whopping year-over-year earnings growth of 240% and substantial revenue growth of 8.5% for the to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Amazon\u2019s earnings surprise history is unimpressive, with a negative surprise of 11.30%, on average, in the last four quarters. The stock has a solid Growth Score of A but falls under a bottom-ranked Zacks industry (bottom 27%).\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the average target price is $147.14, with nearly 97% of the analysts giving a Strong Buy or a Buy rating ahead of the company\u2019s earnings.\n\nStory continues\n\nETFs to Tap\n\nGiven this, investors may want to play these stocks with the help of ETFs. Below, we have highlighted five ETFs having the largest exposure to these giants.\r\n\r\nVanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF (MGK)\r\n\r\nVanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF tracks the CRSP US Mega Cap Growth Index. It holds 96 securities in its basket, with the in-focus two firms collectively accounting for 22.5% of the total assets. It has key holdings in technology and consumer discretionary that account for double-digit exposure each (read: 5 Growth ETFs at New Highs to Start 2H).\r\n\r\nVanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF charges 7 basis points in annual fees and trades in a good volume of around 281,000 shares a day on average. The fund has AUM of $14.4 billion and a Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy).\r\n\r\nRoundhill BIG Tech ETF (BIGT)\r\n\r\nRoundhill BIG Tech ETF is the first-ever FAAMG ETF offering investors concentrated exposure to five mega-cap technology companies known as the \u201cFAAMG\u201d stocks. The three in-focus firms account for a combined 24% share in the basket.\r\n\r\nRoundhill BIG Tech ETF has amassed $3.8 million in its asset base and charges 29 bps in fees per year. It trades in an average daily volume of 5,000 shares.\r\n\r\nMicroSectors FANG+ ETN (FNGS)\r\n\r\nThis ETN is linked to the performance of the NYSE FANG+ Index, which is equal-dollar weighted and designed to provide exposure to a group of highly traded growth stocks of next-generation technology and tech-enabled companies. The note accounts for a 10% share in each of the two stocks (read: Best & Worst ETF Areas of First Half 2023).\r\n\r\nMicroSectors FANG+ ETN has accumulated $138.9 million in its asset base and charges 58 bps in annual fees. It trades in a moderate volume of 178,000 shares a day on average and has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold).\r\n\r\nInvesco QQQ Trust (QQQ)\r\n\r\nInvesco QQQ Trust provides exposure to the 101 largest domestic and international non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq by tracking the Nasdaq 100 Index. Apple and Amazon take the combined 16.8% share in the basket.\r\n\r\nInvesco QQQ is one of the largest and most popular ETFs in the large-cap space, with AUM of $213.3 billion and an average daily volume of 49 million shares. QQQ charges investors 20 bps in annual fees and has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 with a Medium risk outlook.\n\nSingle-Stock ETFs\n\nSingle-stock ETFs have also been gaining immense popularity this year. Unlike traditional ETFs, which typically track a broad index or sector, single-stock ETFs provide exposure to the performance of one specific company by using derivatives. This allows investors to gain exposure to a particular stock without having to buy the stock directly (read: Guide to Single-Stock ETF Investing).\r\n\r\nDirexion Daily AAPL Bull 1.5X Shares (AAPU)\r\n\r\nDirexion Daily AAPL Bull 1.5X Shares tracks the 1.5 times the performance of the stock of Apple It charges 95 bps in annual fees and trades in an average daily volume of 134,000 shares. AAPU has AUM of $39.7 million.\r\n\r\nGraniteShares 1.75x Long AAPL Daily ETF (AAPB)\r\n\r\nGraniteShares 1.75x Long AAPL Daily ETF tracks the 1.5 times the performance of the stock of Apple. It charges 1.15% in annual fees and trades in an average daily volume of 14,000 shares. AAPB has gathered $4.1 million in its asset base.\r\n\r\nDirexion Daily AMZN Bull 1.5X Shares ETF (AMZU)\r\n\r\nDirexion Daily AMZN Bull 1.5X Shares ETF tracks the 1.5 times the performance of the shares of Amazon charging 95 bps in annual fees. It trades in volume of 157,000 shares a day on average and has accumulated assets worth $37.9 million.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

AAPL may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.\n\nThat is because Apple is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings \u2014 with the most up-to-date information possible \u2014 is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for AAPL in this report.\n\nIn fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently higher than the broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.19 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for AAPL, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.66% heading into earnings season.\n\nApple Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Apple Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nApple Inc. price-eps-surprise | Apple Inc. Quote\n\nWhy is this Important?\n\nA positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).\n\nGiven that AAPL has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nClearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Apple, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

However, more times than not, many amateur investors fail to understand that there is often a good reason for the low price, such as poor fundamentals or slowing earnings growth.\n\nIn a value trap, though the price seems low already, the fundamental issues continue to erode value over time, though they once appeared to be a bargain. Avoiding value traps requires an investor to look beyond a low valuation ratio and consider other factors.\n\nHere are signs you may be in a value trap:\n\nThe Company Has \"Caretaker Management\"\n\nWhen a company has a long and successful past, management may fall into the \"caretaker\" trap. In other words, the company has so much cash on hand, and executives get paid such large salaries that there is little motivation to grow the business. For example, in 2022, AT&T CEO John Stankey hauled in more than $20 million in total compensation. Meanwhile, AT&T's EPS fell from 2.63 to 2.57 per share during the same time. In fact, AT&T's earnings have stagnated for years.\n\nStick to companies that are constantly innovating, such as Apple. Though Apple is a massive company, management is always searching for opportunities. Since 2016, AAPL has nearly tripled its annual EPS by innovating and unveiling new products such as the Apple Watch and the wildly popular AirPods. In the long run, the price of a stock is directly correlated to earnings growth.\n\nDividends May Lure You In\n\nStocks like Verizon pay healthy dividends (7.7%). While a 7.7% dividend may be attractive to income-focused investors, investors need to remember that dividends are not paid out in a vacuum. In other words, if a stock is plummeting, even a high dividend will not lead you to profitability. For example, though Verizon's dividend has increased over the past five years, the stock is down 42%.\n\nStory continues\n\nNot only would you be lagging if you were in a stock like VZ over that period, you would also have the added insult of injury of opportunity cost. For instance, the Nasdaq 100 is up 44.3% over the same time.\n\nGARP Is the Solution\n\nA GARP (Growth at a Reasonable Price) Strategy can help investors avoid value traps by balancing growth potential and valuation. Warren Buffett holding Occidental Petroleum is a great example \u2013 the company has a history of strong earnings growth and a reasonable valuation.\n\nConclusion\n\nSometimes, when you pay for a \"cheap stock,\" you get what you pay for. Caretaker management, slow growth, and the wrong environment could mean you're in a classic \"value trap.\" Use a GARP strategy to balance growth and value and get the best of both worlds.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +6.2 average gain per year.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\"Dramatic valuation differences across market cap sizes continue. This has been the case for some time now. Perhaps I have spent too much time discussing these dichotomies, as generally, I feel like if we pick the right stocks and manage market exposures thoughtfully, our equities- oriented portfolio will prosper across various market cycles. However, when markets become as lopsided as they have lately, I feel additional discussion on the market environment is worthwhile, if only to help highlight the opportunities that are available and the likely path forward. I expect future discussions to soon be focused again on our moderately concentrated portfolio. But for now, let\u2019s take one last in-depth look at how far reaching these valuation dichotomies have again become.(Please note: charts that accompany the following can be found in the Appendix.)\n\nTake Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) for example. It is the largest stock by market cap, and fairly considered one of the best companies in the world. The company has been extraordinarily successful and improved standards of living everywhere in the process with their ubiquitous products. Along the way, shareholders have been richly rewarded, with shares increasing nearly fourteen-fold over the last ten years while generating an annualized total shareholder return of 31%, including dividends.\n\nOn the back of another big quarter for large cap tech, it is now the first stock to surpass the $3T market cap threshold.

Officials from Tesla told the Indian government that they\u2019d like some of their Chinese suppliers to establish operations in India to bolster the supply chain.\n\nAccording to sources speaking to Reuters, Indian authorities proposed that Tesla adopt\u00a0Apple Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ: AAPL)\u00a0method, which involved gaining approvals for Chinese suppliers through local joint-venture partners. Direct approval for wholly-owned Chinese companies can prove challenging due to the intense scrutiny they\u2019ve faced since the 2020 border disputes between India and China on their Himalayan border.\n\nWhy it matters? India\u2019s tense relationship with China, following the 2020 border clashes, complicates Tesla\u2019s plans to utilize crucial Chinese suppliers for parts that India lacks locally. This problem isn\u2019t unique to Tesla; even the local Tata Motors sources battery cells from China.\n\nIn recent months, the Indian government has accepted some joint-venture partnerships between Chinese suppliers and Indian firms on a case-by-case basis.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the music industry and recent trends, then go directly to the 5 Most Popular Music Streaming Services.\n\nIn recent years, the music industry has undergone significant changes, and music streaming services have emerged as the dominant global format. Currently, global recorded music revenue is projected to grow at a rate of 7.5% in 2023, with a compound annual growth rate of 8.6% spanning from 2023 to 2030. This trend holds true for the United States as well, where streaming plays a crucial role in the overall music industry revenue, encompassing both physical and digital music sales. In fact, music streaming contributes a staggering 84% of the revenue in the U.S. music industry.\n\nGoldman Sachs Research suggests potential solutions to headwinds in the industry, such as pricing power, superfans monetization, and reevaluating the payment structure between streaming services and music labels. Lisa Yang, head of the European Media and Internet Research team, points out the current streaming practices and says,\n\n\u201cListening to a 31-second song by an independent artist, a full 3-minute song by a popular artist, and 5 minutes of the sound of rain are all treated equally.\u201d\n\nThe team's projections indicate that monetizing superfans could generate an additional $2 billion in revenue for streaming platforms by 2027 and a significant $4 billion by 2030, thereby contributing a notable 16% boost to paid streaming revenues.\n\nThe music industry has also experienced a significant increase in investment companies acquiring music rights, with millions of dollars paid for music catalogs. This surge is driven by the belief that music rights can serve as a valuable asset class, capable of generating long-term income through royalties and licensing deals. Universal Music Group, Sony Music Entertainment, and Warner Music Group Corp. (NASDAQ:WMG)'s dominance in the industry positions them as the primary buyers of music rights.\n\nStory continues\n\nJustin Bieber recently made headlines with his music rights sale, fetching over $200 million from Hipgnosis Songs Capital, marking the most substantial deal among artists of his generation. This sale encompasses Bieber's entire back catalog, consisting of 290 songs released before December 31, 2021. Investment companies see the purchase of music rights as a strategic move, anticipating long-term income through licensing deals and royalty payments, particularly for works from beloved artists.\n\nNumerous prominent musicians, such as Bruce Springsteen, Mariah Carey, Pink Floyd, Adele, Shakira, and Taylor Swift, have made significant deals by selling their music catalogs to investment companies. In November 2021, Bruce Springsteen sold his music rights to Sony Music for approximately $500 million, as reported by The Conversation.\n\nSimilarly, Adele sold half of her music publishing rights to Sony Music for an estimated $130 million in 2021, while Shakira sold her entire music catalog to Hipgnosis Songs Fund for around $300 million in the same year. As the music industry continues to evolve, it is likely that more musicians will follow this trend and sell their music catalogs to investment companies.\n\nGiven the multitude of music streaming services available, you might think about which music streaming service has the best audio quality. When considering the best audio quality among music streaming services, it depends on the user's preference. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:APPL) Music provides Lossless audio quality, surpassing Spotify Technology S.A. (NYSE:SPOT)'s high quality, but requires compatible devices and headphones to fully appreciate the difference. On the other hand, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) Music offers the highest quality with High Definition. But Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) Music also requires compatible equipment to enjoy it fully.\n\nLet\u2019s now explore more about the most popular music streaming services.  15 Most Popular Music Streaming Services\n\nPhoto by Tanner Boriack on Unsplash\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our list of the 15 most popular music streaming services, we based our ranking on the average number of users.

Last month, Bloomberg News reported Apple has quietly built its own framework to create large language models known as \"Ajax\".\n\n\"We expect Apple's updated comments on its AI aspirations to be a focus,\" analysts at Well Fargo wrote in a research note, adding that any commentary around the technology could boost the stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple's shares have gained more than 50% so far this year, compared with a nearly 37% increase in the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite.\n\nIPHONE SLOWDOWN\n\nMuch of the weakness in iPhone sales is expected to come from the Americas, where revenue is set to fall 6%, analysts said. Sales from China - Apple's third-largest market - are expected to be flat due to an uneven economic recovery, though the company has fared better than Android rivals in the country.\n\nOverall smartphone shipments to China declined 2.1% in the second quarter, according to market research firm International Data Corp.\n\n\"Most investors feel a soft China could pose a risk to the numbers and further commentary, but Apple's position in China is on a solid footing and the company is likely to see only a small, if any, decline in iPhone sales,\" Piper Sandler analysts said.\n\n\"If there is any sales weakness from China, it is likely to be easily offset by strong sales momentum in India,\" they added.\n\nMac and iPad sales are expected to fall by 10.6% and 11.2%, respectively, according to Refinitiv data.\n\nBut the services business - home to Apple's App Store and audio and video streaming services - could be a bright spot thanks to an uptick in the ad market, some analysts said.\n\nThe business, which accounts for roughly a quarter of Apple's total revenue, is expected to grow 5.7% as it also benefits from price increases for iCloud subscriptions, though the pace is broadly similar to that in the preceding three quarters.\n\n(Reporting by Yuvraj Malik in Bengaluru; Editing by Sayantani Ghosh and Maju Samuel)", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-heads-largest-q3-revenue-195336996.html", "symbols": ["AAPL.MX", "AAPL.US", "AAPL34.SA", "APC.F", "APC.XETRA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.994, "neg": 0.023, "neu": 0.873, "pos": 0.104}}, {"date": "2023-08-01T19:28:00+00:00", "title": "Apple Earnings Are Soon, and Analysts See the Stock Going Higher and Higher", "content": "For the fiscal third quarter, analysts expect Apple to report sales of $81.9 billion, down about 1% from the year-earlier quarter.\n\nContinue reading", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/m/e83636e3-29fa-35d8-864b-a910efa70e49/apple-earnings-are-soon%2C-and.html", "symbols": ["AAPL.MX", "AAPL.US", "AAPL34.SA", "APC.F", "APC.XETRA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0, "neg": 0, "neu": 1, "pos": 0}}, {"date": "2023-08-01T18:32:00+00:00", "title": "Amazon &amp; Apple Earnings: What to Expect", "content": "Earnings season continues to chug along, with the period kicking into a much higher gear this week. So far, the Q2 cycle has been positive, helping reassure investors and boosting overall sentiment within the market.\n\nAnd this week, we have many notable companies slated to report, including Amazon AMZN and Apple AAPL. Both companies will report after the market\u2019s close on Thursday, August 3rd. Both stocks have staged big rebounds year-to-date, outperforming the general market handily.\n\nBut how do expectations stack up heading into their respective releases? Let\u2019s take a closer look.\n\nAmazon\n\nAnalysts have kept their earnings expectations muted for the quarter to be reported over the last several months, with the $0.34 per share estimate unchanged. The market heavyweight is expected to see a solid recovery, with the value reflecting a 240% improvement in earnings from the year-ago quarter. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAmazon\u2019s top line is also forecasted to see growth; the Zacks Consensus Sales Estimate for the release presently stands at $131.5 billion, 8.5% higher year-over-year. It\u2019s worth noting that the quarterly estimate is up a fractional 0.3% since the end of May.\n\nInvestors will wisely monitor Amazon Web Services (AWS) results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AWS net sales stands at $21.5 billion, indicating a 9% improvement from year-ago sales of $19.7 billion and reflecting a slight slowdown relative to prior year-over-year growth rates.\n\nThe company exceeded the consensus expectation for AWS net sales in its latest release, snapping a streak of back-to-back misses. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Amazon has posted sizable EPS beats in back-to-back releases, exceeding expectations by 47% and 40%. Below is a chart illustrating the share reaction to each of the company\u2019s previous three prints. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nApple\n\nApple\u2019s $1.19 per share estimate for the upcoming release is up a small 0.8% over the last 60 days, reflecting slight bullishness. The company\u2019s earnings are forecasted to retract a modest 1% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe tech titan is expected to post $81.3 billion in quarterly revenue, which reflects a modest 2% decline from year-ago sales of $83.0 billion. The quarterly estimate is down a fractional 0.1% since the end of May, reflecting neutrality among analysts.\n\nWhile iPhone revenue remains important, Apple\u2019s Services results (cloud services, App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay, and others) will also be closely monitored, as it\u2019s quickly become a new source of growth for the company.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Services revenue resides at $20.8 billion, 6% higher than the year-ago quarter. In its latest release, Services revenue of $20.9 billion reflected a quarterly record.\n\nAnd to top it off, our expectation for quarterly iPhone revenue stands at $40.1 billion, 1.4% lower than the year-ago quarter. The technology titan exceeded iPhone revenue expectations by 4% in its last quarter.\n\nApple posted results above estimates in its latest release, with shares reacting favorably post-earnings.

App Store continues to grab the attention of prominent developers from around the world, helping the company to offer exciting new apps that drive traffic.\r\n\r\nServices like Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, Apple Card, Apple Fitness+ and Apple One bundle are expected to have contributed to overall growth.\r\n\r\nApple TV+ has been gaining recognition due to award-winning shows like Ted Lasso. Apple TV+ landed a record-breaking 54 Emmy Award nominations across its original titles this year.\r\n\r\nThe company\u2019s animated movie, The Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the Horse, won an Oscar for Best Animated Short Film.\r\n\r\nApple\u2019s impressive run at the award shows (Emmy, as well as Oscars) has been instrumental in driving recognition of Apple TV+ in the saturated streaming market currently dominated by the likes of Amazon AMZN prime video, Netflix NFLX and Disney\u2019s DIS Disney+.\r\n\r\nHowever, that has not essentially turned into a market share gain for Apple TV+. According to 9TO5Mac, which cited a JustWatch report, Amazon prime video was #1 in terms of market share (21%) in the United States, trailed by Netflix (20%). Max, Disney+ and Hulu had 15%,13% and 11% market share, respectively. Apple TV+ maintained its market share of 6%.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Apple has been keeping no stone unturned to make the TV+ service a success. At a much more affordable price of $4.99, Apple TV+ has been benefiting from quality content with its strong portfolio of original shows and movies.\r\n\r\nOur estimate for fiscal third-quarter Services net sales is pegged at $20.98 billion, up 7% year over year.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Apple has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Pharmaceutical giants Merck & Company Inc (NYSE:MRK)and Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) reported mixed results on Tuesday.\n\nBut investors are keenly focused on Friday's jobs report, which is expected to show the economy added 200,000 jobs, slightly cooling from the prior month, while unemployment is expected to remain at record-lows near 3.6%.

Futures traders see the probability of the Fed remaining at current rate levels when it does meet then, while some see a 30% probability of it raising rates another quarter of a point in November.\n\nThe idea that the Fed could be at the end of its rate hikes is lifting tech stocks, pulling the Nasdaq higher by 37% so far this year.\n\nHere are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:\n\n1.

He\u2019s now calling it \u201cX\u201d and plans to turn the social media platform into a super app where you can do just about everything.\n\n\u201cIn the months to come, we will add comprehensive communications and the ability to conduct your entire financial world. The Twitter name does not make sense in that context, so we must bid adieu to the bird,\u201d Musk stated in a July 24 post.\n\nTime will tell if the eccentric billionaire made the right call.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn the meantime, it\u2019s important to note that corporate rebranding is risky because you potentially alienate your core customer. Twitter/X is already losing hundreds of millions of dollars. Alienating customers further would be a death sentence for the social media platform.\n\nHowever, the impact of rebranding on stocks can be positive for shareholders. Investopedia pointed out that in 2007 Steve Jobs changed the name of the iPhone maker from Apple Computers to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to reflect that the company was more than just computers. Oh, how right he was.\n\nHere are three companies that ought to be following Musk\u2019s lead.\n\nGap (GPS) A close-up view of a Gap (GPS) sign in the window of a Los Angeles, California mall.\n\nSource: Alex Millauer / Shutterstock.com\n\nI can name at least three companies that have changed their corporate name to reflect the diversity of their holdings: Capri Holdings (NYSE:CPRI), Tapestry (NYSE:TPR), and Driven Brand Holdings (NASDAQ:DRVN). They haven\u2019t suffered by changing their name to reflect their multi-brand status.\n\nYet, Gap (NYSE:GPS) continues to go by its legacy brand, even though other brands in the company are better growth vehicles. Rather than continue to remind investors how much of a disaster the Gap brand has become, it should create a name that implies a future with authentic growth brands.\n\nThat\u2019s it: Retail Growth Brands Inc., or RGB, just like the late, great Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\n\nHow bad has it gotten at the Gap group of companies?\n\nStory continues\n\nThey replaced former Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Sonya Syngal with Richard Dickson, the former president and CEO of Mattel (NYSE:MAT) and the man behind Barbie\u2019s revival. At Athleta, its once-promising athleisure brand, it hired Chris Blakeslee, the former president of Alo Yoga.\n\nGiven how many women work at the four major Gap brands, it\u2019s beyond crazy the board couldn\u2019t find a qualified woman to lead the entire company.\n\nThat tells you all you need to know about the dysfunction at Gap. No wonder it\u2019s traded under $20 for the past 20 months.\n\nRollins (ROL) pest control spray ROL stock dividend stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nRollins (NYSE:ROL) is a company I\u2019ve recommended to readers over the past few years. In 2016, I included the pest control company in a group of 10 stocks I thought every retirement portfolio should have.\n\n\u201cOver the long haul, it hasn\u2019t disappointed delivering 18 consecutive years of earnings growth and 14 consecutive years of dividend increases averaging 12%,\u201d I wrote in May of that year.\n\nThe stock is up around 235% in the years since. However, its stock\u2019s become much more volatile since the pandemic started in early 2020. Year-to-date, it\u2019s up 11.7%, trailing the S&P 500 by over 800 basis points. One thing to remember about that lack of performance: Most of the index\u2019s gains are from the \u201cMagnificent 7,\u201d the tech stocks all benefiting from artificial intelligence.\n\nTake out the Mag 7, and Rollins\u2019 returns look just fine.\n\nOn July 26, the company reported healthy top and bottom line growth. Its revenues were $821 million, 14.9% higher than a year earlier. Excluding acquisitions, its revenues were up 7.7% year-over-year. In terms of net income, it earned $114 million on an adjusted basis, 12.2% higher than Q2 2022.\n\nWith industry-leading brand names such as Orkin and Critter Control, the Rollins name says little about those businesses.\n\nGameStop (GME) GameStop (GME) sign on side of building in blue early morning light\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/EchoVisuals\n\nGameStop (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) are two meme stocks that I will not recommend to any investors. They are ridiculously overvalued and represent everything bad about the current investment environment.\n\nHowever, I don\u2019t have a problem recommending that the video game retailer rebrand to something other than GameStop. This legacy name is like a chain around its neck, constantly dragging it down. Serious investors will continue to keep it off their watchlists.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t help that the Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) co-founder and GameStop savior, Ryan Cohen, keeps mowing through senior management. CEO Matt Furlong was shown the door in June after two years in the top job. On July 27, former chief financial officer (CFO) Diana Saadeh-Jajeh resigned after just a year.\n\nGamesIndustry.biz managing editor Brendan Sinclair wrote a scathing piece about GameStop in June. If you\u2019ve got any thoughts on buying GME stock, do yourself a favor and read his article. It\u2019s spot on.\n\nSinclair\u2019s strongest point is that the company has known for years that its days selling video games through brick-and-mortar stores were done. Digital was the only way. Yet, it continues to sputter on that front.\n\n\u201cBut the idea that Cohen has a brilliant plan to fix everything in one fell swoop is simply not credible. He\u2019s essentially been in charge for years now, the fundamental business is still the same, and the user experience online or in-store is not meaningfully better. Bafflingly, it may actually be worse.\u201d Sinclair wrote on June 9.\n\nWith $1.3 billion in cash on its balance sheet, it\u2019s got plenty to do a full-scale rebrand. Unfortunately, as Sinclair pointed out, it\u2019s likely far too late.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

AI Semiconductor Stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nMassachusetts-based Entegris (NASDAQ:ENTG) supplies advanced materials and systems used in the semiconductor device fabrication process, as well as other high-tech industries like life sciences. Shares are up 67% so far in 2023 as money flowed back into the tech sector.\n\nENTG\u2019s advance has accelerated in the past three months, following the release of the company\u2019s first-quarter results. Revenue surged 42% year over year to $922.4 million. That was better than expected, as were adjusted earnings of 65 cents per share.\n\nIn May, Entegris announced the opening of a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Taiwan that is designed to boost the company\u2019s production capabilities of critical semiconductor materials while reducing waste.\n\nRoughly half of the world\u2019s semiconductor chips are made in Taiwan, and Entegris has a longstanding relationship with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), one of the world\u2019s top chipmakers. Further, Taiwan is only increasing in importance as a chip hub as tensions between the U.S. and China rise.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cOur investment is just a sign of the conviction we have in the future of the semiconductor industry in Taiwan,\u201d Entegris Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Bertrand Loy told Nikkei Asia.\n\nAdobe (ADBE) Adobe logo on the smartphone screen is placed on the Apple macbook keyboard on red desk background. ADBE stock.\n\nSource: Tattoboo / Shutterstock\n\nAdobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), one of the best-known software makers, is up 62% year to date. That performance puts it on par with some of the \u201cMagnificent Seven.\u201d\n\nThe company is clearly riding the AI wave higher, having invested heavily in the technology. Its AI-powered tools include Adobe Firefly, which allows users to create images and transform text, and Adobe Sensei, which has been integrated with programs such as Photoshop and Lightroom to improve functionality and efficiency.\n\nAdobe posted better-than-expected quarterly results in mid-June. Revenue was up 10% year over year to $4.82 billion, exceeding the $4.77 billion analysts expected. And adjusted earnings per share of $3.91 easily topped the consensus estimate of $3.79 a share.\n\nChief Financial Officer (CFO) Dan Durn told Barron\u2019s that generative AI should drive revenue and profit growth for decades to come. And Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss cited the company\u2019s AI push as the reason for raising his price target on the stock to $660, which is more than 20% above the current price.\n\nThe combination of AI and the potential end to the latest interest-rate-hike cycle could prove very powerful for ADBE.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple (AAPL) logo on an Apple store in Santa Monica, California.\n\nSource: View Apart / Shutterstock.com\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock has powered higher this year, rising 53%. This is despite the tech giant reporting fiscal Q2 results in May that showed the company\u2019s second consecutive quarter of declining year-over-year sales. Still, earnings beat estimates in the most recent quarter on stronger-than-expected iPhones sales, and investors continued to pile into shares.\n\nApple is set to report fiscal third-quarter results this week. Investors will be watching the report closely. According to Barron\u2019s, analysts at Piper Sandler and Wedbush are telling investors to buy shares even if management\u2019s forecast comes with a warning of a tough smartphone market. Both firms now have a $220 price target on the stock, implying upside of 12%.\n\nApple has plenty going for it. While Mac sales are slumping, services revenue is growing at an impressive clip. The company is looking to India as an opportunity for expanding its consumer and manufacturing base. Additionally, Apple is expected to release its AR/VR headset in 2024, which could create a new product revenue stream for the company. Finally, Apple recently announced it has entered the AI chatbot race.\n\nAll told, AAPL stock is probably one of the most stable growth stock picks you could have in your portfolio\n\nSnowflake (SNOW)  Snowflake symbol and logo at the company corporate headquarters in Silicon Valley. SNOW stock.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock\n\nCloud-based data warehouse company Snowflake (NASDAQ:SNOW) is up 24% year to date, beating the S&P 500\u2019s 19% return but not by as much as most of the other high-potential growth investments on today\u2019s list.\n\nThe company reported better-than-expected revenue and earnings for its fiscal first quarter on May 24. Revenue jumped an impressive 48% year over year, albeit much slower than the 85% growth of the comparable year-ago quarter. Adjusted earnings of 15 cents per share beat the 5-cent estimate, and adjusted free cash flow rose 58% year over year to $287 million. But investors got spooked when management\u2019s forecast for the current quarter and full year came in light.\n\nYet, the company maintains its long-term forecast of hitting $10 billion in product revenue by fiscal 2029, as a Scotiabankanalyst notes. Moreover, the analyst \u201cis confident Snowflake will benefit from a new product cycle in 2024 and 2025, including new offerings targeting artificial intelligence and data science applications,\u201d Barron\u2019s reports.\n\nThis prompted Scotiabank to upgrade SNOW stock to \u201coutperform\u201d and raise its target price to $212 from $137. The new target is 19% above where shares currently trade.\n\nACM Research (ACMR)  a magnifying glass enlarges the ACM logo on a website\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nACM Research (NASDAQ:ACMR) predominantly provides cleaning equipment for semiconductor wafers, but it is expanding into other areas of high-end semiconductor equipment. Shares of the small-cap growth stock are up 70% on a year-to-date basis.\n\nACM Research reported first-quarter results on May 5. Shipments of $89 million were up 33% from a year ago, while revenue increased 76% to $74.3 million. Net income of $7.15 million compared very favorably to a loss of $5.79 million a year ago.\n\nAccording to Gurufocus, the company\u2019s three-year revenue growth rate stands at 47%, better than 94% of its peers. And analysts are forecasting revenue will increase more than 40% this year.\n\nAnalysts are bullish on the stock, with seven rating it a \u201cbuy\u201d and just one \u201chold.\u201d Their average price target of $21.59 is 65% above the current price.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD)  Sign of AMD office in Markham, Ontario, Canada.

That\u2019s more than double the return of competitor Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) but far less than Nvidia\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) 200%-plus surge. This puts AMD in a sort of sweet spot that could mean big returns for growth investors.\n\nWhile Nvidia makes the most-powerful chips that are used to power AI-related technologies, AMD isn\u2019t too far behind. In fact, according to MosaicML, AMD\u2019s AI chips are about 80% as fast as the ones Nvidia makes.\n\n\u201cHanlin Tang, chief technology officer of MosaicML, said that the company believes that further software updates from AMD that are in the works should help its MI250 chip match the performance of Nvidia\u2019s A100,\u201d Reuters reports.\n\nFor those who feel they\u2019ve missed the run-up in NVDA stock, AMD shares could offer a second chance.\n\nYum China (YUMC) YUM stock: the yum logo on the side of a building\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nYum China (NYSE:YUMC) operates many of the Yum Brands (NYSE:YUM) chains that U.S. diners are familiar with but in China, including KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. It also includes local restaurants like Huang Ji Huang and Littel Sheep that specialize in Chinese cuisine. Collectively, Yum China is the largest restaurant firm in China with more than 13,000 locations.\n\nWhile shares are only up 12% year to date, underperforming the broader market, the growth stock remains attractive due to its size and massive customer base.\n\nYum China just reported second-quarter results that beat estimates on the top and bottom lines. Revenue increased 24% to $2.65 billion, while adjusted earnings per share of 47 cents beat by 8 cents. The company opened 422 net new stores during the quarter, and operating profit more than tripled on a year-over-year basis to $257 million.\n\nWall Street analysts currently have an average price target of $73.23 on shares, implying upside of around 20%. Yet, upgrades could start rolling in after the latest earnings report, as the company\u2019s growth metrics and market penetration are difficult to ignore.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Meanwhile, Facebook-owner Meta Platforms is reportedly gearing up to launch a new artificial intelligence chatbot that can take on the personas of different characters. Elsewhere, a bright pulsating sign on the roof of the headquarters of Elon Musk's newly-renamed social media group X is taken down after sparking controversy with local residents.\n\n1. Futures inch lower\n\nU.S. stock futures edged under the flatline on Tuesday as a new month of trading begins with a stream of corporate earnings set to be released.\n\nBy 05:16 ET (09:16 GMT), the Dow futures contract slipped by 97 points or 0.27%, S&P futures lost 12 points or 0.25%, and Nasdaq 100 futures dipped by 48 points or 0.30%.\n\nThe main indices closed out July in the green, with the benchmark S&P 500 jumping by 3.1% during the month after the close of dealmaking on Monday. It was the index's fifth straight month of gains - the longest such streak since 2021. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also climbed by more than 3% in July, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite added around 4.1%.\n\nEmerging signs of cooling inflation, resilient economic activity, and expectations that the Federal Reserve may soon back away from an aggressive campaign of interest rate hikes have combined to help underpin a wide-spread rally in stocks. The second-quarter earnings season, meanwhile, has featured stronger-than-expected results from a host of major companies.\n\n2. Busy earnings week kicks into gear\n\nA rush of corporate returns is due out on Tuesday, accelerating the pace of a busy week that will see more than 160 S&P constituent firms report their latest quarterly earnings.\n\nHeadlining Tuesday's releases before the start of U.S. trading are pharmaceutical companies Merck (NYSE:MRK) and Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), as well as construction equipment giant - and economic bellwether - Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT). Chipmaker AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and coffee chain Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) will also unveil results after the bell.\n\nStory continues\n\nLater in the week, tech giants Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) are scheduled to deliver their latest earnings.\n\nMore than half of the companies in the S&P 500 index have already reported. According to FactSet data cited by CNBC, four-fifths of these businesses have posted earnings that topped Wall Street estimates.\n\n3. Meta preparing to launch AI chatbots - FT\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is preparing to release new artificial intelligence-powered chatbots that have different personalities, according to a report in the Financial Times, as the Facebook parent attempts to boost user engagement.\n\nCiting people familiar with the matter, the paper said Meta is working on prototypes that can carry on humanlike conversations. Some versions of the AI, known internally as \"personas,\" can take on various characters, the FT added. Sources also told the paper that Meta is exploring one chatbot that speaks like Abraham Lincoln or another that gives travel advice in the style of a surfer.\n\nThe chatbots, which the FT said could be launched as soon as September, are being designed to create a new search function and offer recommendations.\n\nMeta declined to comment to the FT.\n\nThe report comes as the Menlo Park, California-based tech giant has been facing fierce competition to attract users and keep them engaged with its platforms. Like other Silicon Valley players, Meta is also in a race to develop -- and ultimately profit from -- AI technology.\n\n4. Controversial X sign dismantled\n\nA large glowing X on the roof of the San Francisco headquarters of X - the short-text messaging company formerly known as Twitter - has been removed following a string of complaints from neighbors.\n\nThe flashing sign had been placed on top of the firm's Market Street high-rise offices last Friday. Over the weekend, 24 complaints about the X were filed with the city's building department, Reuters reported. Locals had been taking videos showing the pulsating light, criticizing it as an intrusive presence in the area.\n\nA spokesperson from San Francisco's Department of Building Inspection told Reuters that inspectors had observed the structure being dismantled on Monday, adding that the property owners will be fined for the \"unpermitted installation of the illuminated structure.\u201d\n\nX, meanwhile, claimed the sign was taken down voluntarily.\n\nThe controversy comes as X's owner Elon Musk is attempting to overhaul the social media group and turn it into a so-called \"everything app\" that includes everything from payments to ride hailing. Musk has also said he would keep X in San Francisco despite what he described as a \"doom spiral\" of businesses leaving the city.\n\n5. Oil drifts lower\n\nOil prices slipped on Tuesday in a sign of potential profit-taking following a July rally that was supported by tightening global supplies and hopes for a rebound in demand in the second half of the year.\n\nBy 05:17 ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.37% lower at $81.50 per barrel, while the Brent contract dropped 0.29% to $85.18 a barrel.\n\nAnalysts cited by Reuters argued that oil prices may be correcting after being overbought in recent months. Meanwhile, sentiment was dented by a private survey that suggested further weakness in the Chinese economy, the world's biggest crude importer.\n\nHowever, both U.S. crude and Brent settled at their highest levels since April on Monday, boosted in part by the prospect of output cuts by Saudi Arabia and Russia this month. Riyadh is also reportedly expected to extend its reductions into September at a meeting this Friday of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies.\n\nMeanwhile, investors are becoming more confident that the Federal Reserve may be able to bring down inflation without causing a wider collapse of the U.S. economy. According to analysts, such a scenario, which has been dubbed a \"soft landing,\" could help bolster fuel demand later this year in the U.S., the world's biggest oil consumer.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nBusy earnings day, Meta reportedly prepares AI chatbot - what's moving markets\n\nFactbox-China's measures to slow yuan depreciation\n\nExclusive-China asks some banks to reduce or delay dollar buying -sources", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/busy-earnings-day-meta-reportedly-052320050.html", "symbols": ["AAPL.US", "AMD.US", "AMZN.US", "CAT.US", "DJI.INDX", "FB2A.F", "FB2A.XETRA", "IXIC.INDX", "META.US", "MRK.US", "PFE.US", "SBUX.US"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.944, "neg": 0.045, "neu": 0.89, "pos": 0.065}}, {"date": "2023-08-01T03:22:48+00:00", "title": "Apple Supplier Foxconn Plans $500 Million Component Plants in India", "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc.\u2019s main supplier, Foxconn Technology Group, plans to increase its investments to more than $1.2 billion in southern India\u2019s Karnataka state and add two component factories there, expanding a steady diversification from China to mitigate the risks of US economic and technology sanctions.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nUS, Europe Growing Alarmed by China\u2019s Rush Into Legacy Chips Charles Koch-Tied Group Seeks to Block Trump From GOP Nomination Asia\u2019s Richest Families Fuel Race for Lucrative Finance Jobs Myanmar Junta Pardons Aung San Suu Kyi on Some Charges Singapore PM to Address Political Scandals in Parliament\n\nAt least one of the factories that the Taiwanese company plans to construct in Karnataka will produce Apple parts, including for iPhones, people familiar with the matter said.

Foxconn and smaller Taiwanese rival Pegatron Corp. now both operate iPhone assembly facilities in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. Other states such as Karnataka have also wooed companies with quick decision-making, cutting down on red tape and throwing in subsidies.\n\nSeparately, a Foxconn subsidiary also signed an initial agreement with the southern Tamil Nadu government to set up its own components plant with an investment of 16 billion rupees ($195 million), the state\u2019s industries ministry said Monday.

But strong results from tech heavyweights Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) last week set a positive tone for the upcoming earnings.\n\nOptimism over improving global economic prospects - amid easing inflation and resilient growth in major economies - also spurred flows into risk-heavy stocks.\n\nTech-heavy indexes lead gains\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s KOSPI was the best performer for the day, up over 1% on strength in heavyweight chipmaking stocks. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (KS:005930) rose 1.2% after U.S. memory chip making peer Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC) said that the worst for the industry was over, even as the firm forecast a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss and revenue drop.\n\nStrength in internet giants Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (HK:9988) (NYSE:BABA), Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700), and Baidu Inc (HK:9888) (NASDAQ:BIDU) kept the Hang Seng index in positive territory, even as other sectors on the index logged steep losses. Property developer Country Garden (HK:2007) slid over 5% after it scrapped a $300 million capital raise.\n\nThe Taiwan Weighted index logged small gains, while Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 rose 0.6% on strong automobile and tech stocks.\n\nSentiment towards Japanese stocks was also aided by emergency bond buying by the Bank of Japan, which pushed up bets that the bank was in no hurry to tighten policy immediately.\n\nFutures for India\u2019s Nifty 50 index pointed to a flat open, although both indexes were close to hitting record highs on strength in heavyweight tech stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nStill, gains in most markets were limited as investors remained wary of key U.S. nonfarm payrolls data this week. Mixed economic cues from China also dented sentiment.\n\nAustralia\u2019s ASX 200 rose 0.3% ahead of a closely-watched Reserve Bank decision later in the day. Markets are split over whether the bank will hike rates further.\n\nChinese stocks lag on weak PMIs, stimulus in focus\n\nChina\u2019s Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 index rose just 0.1%, while the Shanghai Composite fell slightly as a private survey showed on Tuesday that the country\u2019s manufacturing sector unexpectedly shrank in July.\n\nThe reading follows a dismal official survey for July, and shows that China\u2019s biggest economic engines are seeing little signs of recovery this year.\n\nThe reading spurred more expectations of stimulus measures from the country, with officials promising more policies to boost domestic consumption and activity. But they have so far offered no clear specifics on the policies, which has left investors somewhat wary of local stocks.\n\nWhile the prospect of more Chinese stimulus had spurred strong gains in local stocks over the past week, the momentum now appears to be slowing.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAsian stocks push higher on tech strength, China lags\n\nDaimler Truck post 15% revenue growth in second quarter\n\nYum China sticks to plan to open up to 1,300 new stores this year -CEO", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/asian-stocks-push-higher-tech-235416906.html", "symbols": ["0700.HK", "2007.HK", "9888.HK", "9988.HK", "AAPL.US", "AMZN.US", "BABA.US", "BIDU.US", "GOOGL.US", "HSI.INDX", "META.US", "MSFT.US", "WDC.US"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.992, "neg": 0.066, "neu": 0.794, "pos": 0.14}}, {"date": "2023-07-31T21:07:35+00:00", "title": "Dow Jones Futures: Microsoft, Tesla At Key Support Levels; 5 Big Earnings Movers", "content": "Dow Jones futures: Microsoft and Tesla stock could soon offer new buy points.

Apple (AAPL) which is up some 50% so far this year, is also a member of the Tech sector, too.\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), along with Meta Technologies (META), is a member of the Communication Services sector.\n\nAnd even with the rally broadening in recent months, we can see Tech is still doing a lot of the heavy lifting. It may not be a surprise, then, to learn that both Apple and Meta have been positive each month this year. (For Meta, the streak of monthly wins extends all the way back to November 2022.)\n\nStory continues\n\nThrough May, Amazon (AMZN) and other e-commerce plays were primarily responsible for boosting gains in the Consumer Discretionary sector.\n\nIn the two months since, brick and mortar stalwarts like Kohl's (KSS) and Nordstrom (JWN) have joined the rally, with each up over 50% since the end of May.

China persists to be \"a lingering threat\" for Apple as \"political winds are blowing hard,\" but Rao anticipates the iPhone maker's geopolitical relationships to be smoothed before seeing any major disruptions. On the other hand, Rao believes Amazon's AWS \"growth engine is sputtering\" but does not anticipate slowdowns to show up in this quarter's earnings.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nSEANA SMITH: Let's talk about one of the big stories of this week. And that's big tech, the focus continuing here. And this week, we're going to hear from Apple and Amazon. Both stocks showing gains of over 50% so far this year. Analysts adjusting some of their price targets ahead of the results that we got. When it comes to Amazon, Credit Suisse, Wedbush, both boosting their price targets, while Citi keeping the tech giant as one of their top picks across the internet sector.\n\nWell, here to discuss what we could expect, we want to bring in Santosh Rao, Manhattan Venture Partners Head of Research. Santosh, it's great to see you again. So just give me a sense first before we get into the look-ahead for what we're going to hear from this week. Last week, we heard from Meta, from Google, from Microsoft. What's your sense just about where these tech giants stand and whether or not the fundamentals hold up to their current valuations?\n\nSANTOSH RAO: Yeah. Thanks for having me. I think last week's earnings were very good. They showed that digital advertising is doing great. There's a lot of demand. AIs, of course, the big kicker for both of them, for most of them, and for also going forward.\n\nBut in general, the setup is perfect for the big tech companies. And there they sit in the sweet spot of where the spending is and where it's going to be down the road. So definitely a good setup for Apple and Amazon reporting on Thursday. So I think, overall, the setup is good. The tailwind is good. So we saw good earnings from both of them, good reports from both of them. And we'll continue to see them this Thursday as well.\n\nStory continues\n\nDIANE KING HALL: But Santosh, I want to ask you specifically about Apple. What are your expectations with regard to the company and particularly when you think about just smartphone sales and some of the sluggishness that we've seen there?\n\nSANTOSH RAO: Yeah. So having said that, having said that both companies are good, I like both of them. I like Apple more than Amazon. I think Apple has many things going for it. Right now, July is seasonally a slow quarter. September is a big quarter. The iPhone 15 is going to come out. But there are some issues this time around, because there were some the slowdown in production and shipments and then push out of some premium models.\n\nSo I think you're going to see a little bit of disruption of sorts in the September quarter. So you might see weakness there. But overall, it's plus or minus here and there, net on a secular basis, Apple is still strong. It has a number of levers to pull. The services business is doing very well. It will continue to grow, continue to execute. And as more people come on board, you're going to see the services revenues go up and up more and more.\n\nSo I think Apple has a lot of-- and then you have China. China is opening up very well. I think from some data show that they took some market share in China. And-- and then India is a bright spot. That's the next growth frontier for them. So there are a lot of things to look forward to. They deserve the benefit of doubt. You don't bet against Apple, because they always come through. Yes, they have run up quite a bit, 50% according to, I think, the last special. So it's pretty strong. I think it's time-- It can take a pause. In no way is the story broken. It's a long way to go. Apple will continue to execute and will do well.\n\nSEANA SMITH: Santosh, you mentioned China there. Curious, how do you see or do you see the souring relations between Washington and Beijing? How big of a risk or what does that impact potentially look like for Apple?\n\nSANTOSH RAO: Yes, I think that is a big issue. And hopefully, it'll be resolved well. And that's why they are diversifying. They opened in India. They're going to produce the iPhones there. So they are diversifying. They're spreading their bets. And so they're not totally focused. But they are pretty deeply entrenched in China. So it's going to take a long time to get out of that. So they have to walk a delicate balance and hope that the relations stay, and we don't break away, break off badly.\n\nBut at this point, looks like the business relationship is still going on. The political winds are blowing hot, really hot. But I think it hasn't come to a point where it's going to totally disrupt their business in China. So yes, it's a threat. It's a lingering threat, has been there for a while. The stock is still traded up despite that. But there's something to be-- there's something that needs to be watched going forward.\n\nDIANE KING HALL: Santosh, I want to quickly ask you about Amazon. What are you expecting when it reports this week, particularly when we look at AWS?\n\nSANTOSH RAO: Yeah. I think that is the biggest issue with the Amazon. That's the story. I mean, the growth engine is sputtering. And that is a big issue with Amazon. It was really driving, that was the crown jewel for this time. So let's see where that goes. And it's definitely going to slow down.\n\nAnd both companies are going to be in line numbers. And their earnings reports are going to be in line. So that's not going to be a surprise. But there is going to be slowdown in terms of the mix. AWS is now going to be 10% year-over-year growth as opposed to well over 30% a while back or 16%. So I think it's definitely sequentially coming down. And that's a concern.\n\nBut the ad business is growing. And with Amazon, the big concern is the consumer. The discretionary spending is soft. To the extent, things slow down in the second half. If we have the recession that people talk about, hopefully, it's not that deep. It's short and shallow. But if it slows down things and spending goes down, I think that has an impact on Amazon. So there are some issues.\n\nBut I also think Amazon is a work in progress in many ways. They're still rationalizing their costs. They're bringing everything under control. So it's still going on that side of the business, the cost side of the business. On the revenue side, they need to still work on that. There are some headwinds that they need to work through. But I think they took their cuts before-- they took their hits before. So now, they're coming up. So they might go a little bit here and there. But overall, the trend is going to be up, because these are great companies.\n\nSEANA SMITH: Santosh, how realistic do you think the Street is being right now about AI and the immediate capabilities? Because we did see some of that concern reflected in Microsoft after they reported, when they came out and said that their rollout of the capabilities, it's going to be gradual. Do you think the Street has realistic expectations?\n\nSANTOSH RAO: The Street is betting on the future. We haven't seen any material revenues as such. It's going to take some time. But we know the potential. It's going to be great. And every company across the board is investing in that. So you will to see the benefits down the road. But by the time you see the benefits, the stocks might have run up already. So I think it's time to take a call at this point.\n\nWe know the potential. We know what it's going to do, how disruptive it's going to be, the creative destruction it's going to cause across the board. I think that's in there. So now, unless you have a strategy-- and that's one thing against Apple. They still haven't really clarified what their AI strategy is, generative strategy is, so to speak. And Amazon also to some extent is a laggard there. So you need to have a clear vision. The Street will reward you, because that is the future, whichever way you see.\n\nBut so far, we haven't seen it in the numbers. It's down the road. It's the potential that you're betting on. And let's see. I mean, the early signs are that the technology is great. It's going to have wonders on the productivity side, which is what they need in the face of wages going up and labor shortages and all that stuff. Anything that will help productivity, and AI will. AI will help in productivity.\n\nDIANE KING HALL: Well, hopefully-- definitely, yes, will help with productivity. Hopefully, we all get to keep our jobs in light of that. Santosh Rao, thank you so much. Thank you for joining us.\n\nSANTOSH RAO: Yes.

This represents its longest such stretch since August 2020. It has risen 44% in 2023, with excitement surrounding artificial intelligence a primary driver behind the gains.\n\nThe index is heavily weighted toward megacap internet and technology stocks, which have led the market higher over the year. Quarterly results out of the sector \u2014 including from stocks like Alphabet Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. \u2014 have underlined how big tech continues to offer robust fundamentals.\n\n\u201cWe continue to expect global tech earnings growth to turn more positive in the second half and potentially grow by low teens next year,\u201d wrote Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management.

To skip our detailed analysis of the trends and dynamics of women's businesses, head directly to see the 5 Richest Women in the World.\n\nWomen\u2019s Wealth\n\nA lot of the richest people in the world have had to lose their wealth in 2022. According to Forbes World\u2019s Richest List 2023, the total number of billionaires dropped from 2,668 in 2022 to 2,640 in 2023. Overall, the world\u2019s billionaires have lost $500 billion of net worth from $12.7 trillion in March 2022 to $12.2 trillion in March 2023. An interesting fact to note is that the number of female billionaires is on the rise. Among the top richest people in the world, there are 337 women billionaires, up from 327 in 2022.\n\nWomen have started to step up and take the initiative of starting their businesses. As we mentioned earlier, almost half of all women-owned businesses are from three sectors that include healthcare and social assistance, beauty and pet care, and scientific and technical services. Women-owned businesses in the U.S. have performed significantly well. First Round Capital claims that the companies it invested in with female founders outperformed all-male founding companies by 63%. Additionally, as we discussed previously, Kauffman Fellows found women-led teams produced 35% better return on investment compared to all-male teams.\n\nWomen Kept Under Shadows for Years\n\nWomen have faced gender discrimination for centuries in politics, in the workplace, and at home. In some countries, women are legally restricted to work in certain professions while in other economies, they are discriminated against by pay gaps. These are a few problems that have kept women under the shadow for many years. Developed economies have made major changes in their laws and frameworks to implement gender equality across all phases of life.\n\nFeminists have been vocal about the interests of women in all fields of life. According to Pacific University, in 1848 the first wave of modern feminism took place at the Seneca Falls Convention. Elizabeth Cady Stanton introduced and drafted the Seneca Falls Declaration highlighting the ideology and political aspects of the movement. The second movement in the 1960s focused on social equality with equal rights regardless of sex. The movement continued once again in the 1990s, proving the point that women can play an equal and as important role as men.\n\nStory continues\n\nTechnology Paving Ways for Women\n\nOne of the major things that have played a big role in women\u2019s equality is technology. Modern technology has created awareness across the globe and women have explored their potential in the best way possible. For instance, women entrepreneurs have made the best use of e-commerce. The e-commerce marketplace has allowed women to capitalize in one of the largest markets in the world.\n\nThe biggest e-commerce company, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), has around 9.7 million sellers worldwide, and 1.9 million are active on the platform. On June 19, SellerApp shared the Amazon.com seller statistics showing that women account for 33% of the retailer's sellers, which is a sublime development for women entrepreneurs.\n\nCompanies Led by Female CEOs\n\nWe have entered a new era as more than 10% of women now lead Fortune 500 companies. The Fortune 500 ranks the largest U.S. public companies by revenue. These companies accumulate around $18 trillion in revenue, representing more than two-thirds of the U.S. GDP. For many decades, the big companies were dominated by male executives. Now we have 53 female CEOs leading Fortune 500 companies, which enlightens gender diversity in executive leadership to another level. Women now have a more important role to play as executives, making massive decisions at the top level.\n\nSome of the Fortune 500 companies which are led by female CEOs include Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), CVS Health Corp. (NYSE:CVS), General Motors Co. (NYSE:GM), Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA), and Elevance Health Inc. (NYSE:ELV). These five Fortune 500 companies are led by CEOs Lisa Su, Karen Lynch, Mary Barra, Rosalind Brewer, and Gail Koziara Boudreaux, respectively. The female CEOs are putting in a great effort to take these companies to new heights. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is one of the largest companies on the Fortune 500 list. On June 14, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) unveiled its next-generation chip called MI-300 at its product reveal event, which is being considered a potential alternative to NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s AI chips. The company is using AI to be its next big tool for GPUs, CPUs, and adaptive computing solutions. The CEO of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Lisa Su, during the launch event, highlighted AI as \"AMD's largest and most strategic long term growth opportunity.\" Shortly after the event, Lisa Su, appeared in an interview on CNBC to discuss the development of their new AI chip, M1-300. AMD has entered into a new phase of chipmaking with the announcement of its newest generation chip. Su added that everyone is talking about Chatgpt and large language models, and MI-300 is designed for these use cases. Here are some of the comments from Su:\n\n\"AI is the defining megatrend for the technology right now. Like, everybody is talking about AI, we have been working on this roadmap for many many years. MI-300 is our newest generation chip and frankly, it\u2019s incredible and I mean, the amount of technology we have on this, a 153 billion transistors. Our customers are super excited about this and we are working closely with them. We will sample in the third quarter and will be in production by the end of the year.\n\nWhat we see is there is a tremendous demand for GPUs in AI space, for both training and inference. We work with all of the largest cloud manufacturers and many of the largest enterprise guys. So, the key is to get these products to market as fast as possible. It is an incredible time for technology. AI has kinda changed the way we perceive what we\u2019re doing in every industry and every market for all of our productivity and business applications.\n\nWe have developed a really comprehensive software capability that is optimized for hardware. We call that the ROCm ecosystem, but on top of that we\u2019ve all these folks in the market that are really developing these frameworks, and the purpose of these frameworks is actually to make it fairly easy and transparent to move different hardware ecosystems.\"\n\nAccording to Su, the total addressable market for AI GPUs is around $30 billion right now and it is going to grow more than 50% each year over the next three to four years. \"We see like $150 billion by the time we get to 2027,\" added Su. 25 Richest Women in the World\n\nRawpixel.com/Shutterstock.com\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo find the list of the 25 richest women in the world, we took the data from Forbes\u2019 Real-time Billionaire List.

Those are the ones that are creating this AI empire. And we do see that. AI is driving the valuation growth. We were dead in November 2022. There was pre-ChatGPT and then post ChatGPT. You could see the tech starts starting to grow. So that's the big thing.\n\nBut the second thing we discovered was ads are back for the few companies that are left and the ones that are actually growing, of course-- here's where Meta comes into play, Google comes into play, and what we'll be looking for is Amazon and Apple. Apple doesn't break out its advertising revenues, but Amazon is now the third largest digital ad player in the market.\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: And we knew that there was this pull back in ad spending. Why do you think people are honing back into some of these stalwarts when it comes to eyes for consumers and ads?\n\nStory continues\n\nR \"RAY\" WANG: Rachelle, it's a great question. I think what happens is if you've got the network, you've got the power to reach out to folks, and there are very few mass marketing capabilities left. And so Amazon has amazing reach because of commerce, Google has amazing reach because of search, and of course, Alphabet or-- Alphabet has amazing reach because of search.\n\nAnd then of course, we're seeing what's going on with Facebook because of the network effects on Meta. Now that also means other companies like Spotify, who are showing some growth. Yes, music isn't going to carry you all the way. Netflix subscriptions aren't going to carry all the way and you need to have multiple monetization models to be able to survive.\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: And of course, we have to talk about the cloud, especially as we look at what happened with Microsoft's drop in cloud growth here. What is the story there? And how temporary is? Is this part of a new normal? A shift that we should expect when it comes to cloud.\n\nR \"RAY\" WANG: Well, the reason I say it's cloudy times ahead is because we're seeing some interesting usage of the cloud. A lot of companies just took their stuff and put it onto the cloud and hoped it was going to get cheaper, but now a new class of CIOs are doing something different. They're taking cloud hosting costs and cloud operating costs from maybe $1,000 a month and getting it down to $100 a month.\n\nAnd so we're about to see some rationalization and cloud usage just as of AI is picking up. And so we've got to see what happens if cloud contracts are coming down or if cloud usage is going to go down. And so Microsoft got through that. Amazon, we're going to watch very carefully on what their numbers are on August 3, and that will give us an indicator of what's going on. But Google didn't do too bad. They are flat at 28%. It is the summer, and we're going to see more pickup usually in the fall.\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: And of course, we have to talk Apple whether it's becoming that $3 trillion stock or whether it's-- what they're doing with their own sort of chip making there. What are your expectations and have they really outperformed the way that you thought they would?\n\nR \"RAY\" WANG: No, they've done really well given where the market is. There's an expectation that revenues are going to decline again in this quarter. It's been two quarters of decline, but we're still in a supercycle of refresh for iPhones, and it's not about the number of iPhone sales, and we won't see iPhone 15 sales if they make that announcement in the future. What this is about is how much can be made per iPhone. It's about the services revenue and Apple's story around that is very important. It's because they've been able to grow the revenue per device, and that's an important number to look at.\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: And I want to talk Amazon as well because we've talked about cloud, especially when it comes to Microsoft there. But what about Amazon as well and the growth story there? Because I mean, we're hearing bits and bobs about their AI plans as well but not really as-- it's not really a big topic of conversation to the extent that we would have expected.\n\nR \"RAY\" WANG: Yeah, so here's the interesting thing. There's been a lot of cost cutting at core Amazon. They've actually rejiggered their supply chains and their capacity and their warehouses, but they've improved the automation and what they're able to do now is deliver at a package or deliver any kind of parcel at a cost lower than anybody else, more automated than anyone else, and more track than anyone else, which means they can start using AI machine learning internally to drive down the cost.\n\nAnd then the second piece is where is AWS growth? And AWS, right now, is actually winning among partner mindshares. Large partners are actually being embraced by AWS, which wasn't the case in the past, and they're seeing that level of growth that's very, very different than some of the other partnerships that we've seen in the cloud. So we're looking at those two factors-- core Amazon performance, and of course, what's going on with AWS.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/video/ai-driving-valuation-growth-big-171849913.html", "symbols": ["AAPL.MX", "AAPL.US", "AAPL34.SA", "ABEA.F", "ABEA.XETRA", "ABEC.F", "ABEC.XETRA", "AMZ.F", "AMZ.XETRA", "AMZN.MX", "AMZN.US", "AMZO34.SA", "APC.F", "APC.XETRA", "GOGL34.SA", "GOGL35.SA", "GOOG.MI", "GOOG.MX", "GOOG.US", "GOOGL.US"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.999, "neg": 0.012, "neu": 0.874, "pos": 0.115}}, {"date": "2023-07-31T16:35:01+00:00", "title": "Read This Before You Pick Your Favorite Artificial Intelligence Stocks", "content": "Investors have piled into some of the biggest tech stocks in the market, wagering that they will benefit from the artificial intelligence boom. + That's compared with 20 times the projecting earnings for the broader index, according to Goldman Sachs. \"The [dot-com] experience of the late 1990s is worth remembering because some telecom companies that spent mightily to install miles of dark fiber never generated a return sufficient to cover their cost of capital,\" Goldman analysts wrote in a note to clients today.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/m/47267356-037f-349a-9d1f-7604bac303e9/read-this-before-you-pick.html", "symbols": ["AAPL.MX", "AAPL.US", "AAPL34.SA", "ABEA.F", "ABEA.XETRA", "ABEC.F", "ABEC.XETRA", "AMZ.F", "AMZ.XETRA", "AMZN.MX", "AMZN.US", "AMZO34.SA", "APC.F", "APC.XETRA", "GOGL34.SA", "GOGL35.SA", "GOOG.MI", "GOOG.MX", "GOOG.US", "GOOGL.US"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.791, "neg": 0, "neu": 0.906, "pos": 0.094}}, {"date": "2023-07-31T16:13:59+00:00", "title": "Trucking Firm Yellow Ceases Operations, Walmart Buys Out Tiger Global's Stake, Former Disney Executives Join As Advisers To CEO Bob Iger: Today's Top Stories", "content": "Benzinga\n\nItalian Competition Authority Closes Investigation into Google's Alleged Abuse of Dominance, Commits to Enhancing Data Portability\n\nThe Italian Competition Authority has ended its probe into the alleged abuse of its position by\u00a0Alphabet Inc's (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google LLC, Google Ireland Limited, and Google Italy S.r.l (Google) by making the proposed commitments binding.

To help you understand what is going on and what we expect to happen in the future, our highly-experienced Kiplinger Letter team will keep you abreast of the latest developments and forecasts (Get a free issue of The Kiplinger Letter or subscribe). You'll get all the latest news first by subscribing, but we will publish many (but not all) of the forecasts a few days afterward online. Here\u2019s the latest...\n\nWith Apple\u2019s first virtual-reality headset, called Apple Vision Pro, set to go on sale in early 2024, the VR race is officially on. But it will be a marathon, not a sprint. Apple may sell only a few hundred thousand devices of what it calls \"a revolutionary spatial computer\" (because it blends digital content with the physical world) in the first sales year, maybe fewer, as the price is too high for mass adoption.\n\nThe company\u2019s focus: luring developers to produce apps and content, similar to how it built an ecosystem of iPhone apps. The device has garnered glowing reviews and is packed with high-end tech, much of it built in-house, including two low-power computer chips. Manufacturing is complex and drives up the price to $3,500, much more than other models from Meta (with its $999.99 Meta Quest Pro device) or HTC (and its $1,099 VIVE XR Elite).\n\nApple (AAPL) and Meta (META) combined have invested over $100 billion in Virtual Reality research, per one estimate, so both companies are in this promising market for the long haul.\n\nThis forecast first appeared in The Kiplinger Letter, which has been running since 1923 and is a collection of concise weekly forecasts on business and economic trends, as well as what to expect from Washington, to help you understand what\u2019s coming up to make the most of your investments and your money.

To get news like this delivered straight to your inbox,\u00a0click here.\n\nLast week, I revealed a list of the five top \u201cmoonshot\u201d artificial intelligence (AI) stocks from across InvestorPlace.com.\n\nNot only are these elite companies the leaders in their field, but their relatively low valuations also make them far likelier to succeed.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAs the 1999 tech bubble reminds us, it\u2019s the smaller startups and turnarounds that end up trouncing the incumbents. (Consider how underdog Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) outperformed blue-chip Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) during that period!)\n\nBut not every investor can shoulder the volatility of the riskiest moonshot bets.\n\nCompanies like C3.ai (NASDAQ:AI) and Sabre (NASDAQ:SABR) from last week\u2019s letter are highly unprofitable. Meanwhile, those like GitLab (NASDAQ:GTLB) will require years of hypergrowth to reach their full potential.\n\nBuying only a few shares of these moonshot companies limits the potential profit to investors.\n\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019m revealing another five artificial intelligence bets from our writers at InvestorPlace.com.\n\nThese firms are mostly larger, have lower volatility, and are still benefiting from artificial intelligence tailwinds.\n\n5 AI Stocks Poised for Growth: Adobe (ADBE) Adobe logo on the smartphone screen is placed on the Apple macbook keyboard on red desk background. ADBE stock.\n\nSource: Tattoboo / Shutterstock\n\nAdobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) presents a challenge for investors. The graphics software firm is highly attractive for its profitability. Its 20% return on capital invested (ROIC) makes it five times more profitable than Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) by that metric.\n\nBut on the other hand, the company\u2019s high quality comes with an equally high stock price.\n\nShares of the California-based firm trade at 32X forward earnings, well above the 20X median for all S&P 500 companies. The average Wall Street analyst gives Adobe only a 5% upside relative to current prices.\n\nFortunately, this will change as Adobe\u2019s AI offerings grow.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs Samuel O\u2019Brient notes in his recent article \u201c25 Millionaire-Maker AI Stocks to Buy Now:\u201d\n\nThe AI boom should give investors and analysts even more reason to embrace ADBE stock\u2026\n\nIt is incorporating generative AI into its well-known products [which] will likely make it an even more popular tool among graphic design professionals and other creatives who depend upon it.\n\nThat will put Adobe on a new growth path.\n\nMedia firms are increasingly turning to generative AI to help create content, and Adobe\u2019s lead in the industry gives it a distinct advantage over competitors like Avid Technology (NASDAQ:AVID) that have fewer AI capabilities.\n\nAs AI adoption accelerates, so too will Adobe\u2019s ability to grow.\n\n2. Intel (INTC) Close up of Intel (INTC) sign at entrance of The Intel Museum in Silicon Valley. Intel is an American multinational corporation and technology company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\n\u201cNo words can portray or explain the historic collapse of Intel,\u201d David Moadel noted in a recent article.\n\nAmerica\u2019s largest chipmaker \u2013 Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) \u2013 is now expected to generate only $2.46 billion in profits this year, down from $21 billion in 2019. Intense competition from Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is also keeping prices low, especially in server-related chips.\n\nStill, Moadel suspects that Intel is about to turn a corner:\n\nOpportunities to ride along with a zero-to-hero stock don\u2019t come along every day. The sentiment surrounding Intel is tepid at best right now. However, that could instantly change.\n\nThat\u2019s because Intel is quietly pushing ahead with AI applications.\n\nLast week, the firm announced it would offer 34 open-source AI reference kits, the result of a years-long collaboration with consulting firm Accenture (NYSE:ACN). The firm also plans on introducing chips specific to AI use by 2025, codenamed \u201cFalcon Shores.\u201d\n\nIntel announced better-than-expected earnings on Thursday, July 27, suggesting that its cost-cutting measures are finally working.\n\nMost importantly, Intel\u2019s cheap share price leaves plenty of room for upside.\n\nShares of the struggling chipmaker are down 50% since 2021 and only trade at 16X 2025 earnings.\n\nIf Intel succeeds in turning its business around, it could look much like Apple in the early 2000s: A fallen giant ready to surge again.\n\n3. Meta Platforms (META) Meta Written On The Googles - Man Wearing Virtual Reality Goggles Inside A Metaverse. FTC investigating META.\n\nSource: Aleem Zahid Khan / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn February, Luke Lango suddenly turned bullish on Facebook parent Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and other big-tech stocks:\n\nNow\u2019s the time to buy Big Tech stocks. That\u2019s just what you do with long-term winners. You sell them when they are overhyped and undervalued. You buy them when they are underappreciated and undervalued.\n\nIt was a tactical trade. Big-tech firms had just sold off, and their valuations had become irresistible.\n\nThis week, Dana Blankenhorn joined Luke in recommending Meta, thanks to the tech giant\u2019s newfound strength in artificial intelligence:\n\nMeta\u2019s efforts in generative artificial intelligence (AI), where it has open-sourced key technologies, are also a contrast to other [cloud companies], which have urged government regulation to control the software\u2026\n\nIts dominant position providing free services in the developing world has proven more powerful than any missteps with Threads or the metaverse. I admit I underestimated it.\n\nMeta also recently announced it would give its \u201cLlama 2\u201d large language model away for free, upsetting a standing rivalry between OpenAI and Google. This now puts Meta in the running for AI applications.\n\nFinally, Meta\u2019s shares remain inexpensive compared to other \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d stocks.\n\nThe company trades at 19X 2025 earnings, well below Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) at 26X, Apple at 29X and Amazon at 49X.\n\nThough the firm has less upside than last week\u2019s \u201cmoonshot\u201d picks, Meta\u2019s stability and constant cash generation makes it a safer bet on AI than most.\n\n4. Palantir (PLTR) A close-up shot of a hand on a screen with the Palantir (PLTR) logo.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn 1994, consulting firm Accenture formed its Business Process Management unit to help companies outsource work.\n\nIt was a hit.\n\nWithin a decade, the management consulting firm had transformed into a service company focused on implementation. Today, Accenture is a $200 billion behemoth in tech and cloud-based outsourcing.\n\nPalantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) could soon walk the same path.\n\nThe $36 billion data analytics company focuses on helping governments and large enterprises manage, secure and analyze data. If the U.S. Army needs help creating an AI-enabled system, they\u2019re more likely to turn to Palantir than attempt to build one from scratch.\n\nThis week, Faisal Humayun writes how he expects bullish momentum to be sustainable for Palantir and that AI applications could add further growth. InvestorPlace.com writer Larry Ramer also notes that well-respected analyst Dan Ives now calls Palantir an \u201cunmatched\u2026 AI fortress\u201d and has a $25 price target.\n\nThat said, Palantir still has a lot of work to do in AI.\n\nThe company doesn\u2019t yet have deep in-house AI capabilities. Its platforms mostly involve data gathering and analysis. Ramer also notes how he has \u201cseen no evidence of Palantir investing a significant amount of funds in developing AI before 2023.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, Accenture\u2019s experience shows that it\u2019s not always necessary to have every platform in-house. If Palantir can develop its sales teams to mirror those of consulting firms, Dan Ives\u2019 bullish calls will likely prove correct.\n\n5. DigitalOcean (DOCN) A laptop screen displays the logo for DigitalOcean (DOCN).\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock.com\n\nFinally, Bret Kenwell writes this week how DigitalOcean (NYSE:DOCN) is now a \u201cbuy\u201d following its acquisition of Paperspace, an AI cloud computing startup.\n\nHere\u2019s how CEO Yancey Spruill explains the acquisition:\n\nThe demand for AI/ML cloud solutions has witnessed an unprecedented surge, fueled by the emergence of large language models (LLMs)\u2026\n\nTogether, DigitalOcean and Paperspace will unlock opportunities\u2026 [that will] delve into AI/ML applications such as generative media, text analysis, natural language understanding, recommendation engines, and image classifications.\n\nEven before the acquisition, DigitalOcean was a highly cash-flow positive firm. The New York-based company helps small and medium-sized businesses migrate to the cloud with virtual private servers (VPS). These scalable servers are a profitable business. Analysts were already expecting a strong $173 million profit in 2023.\n\nThe move into generative AI now gives DigitalOcean greater room for growth, especially if demand for pretrained systems begin to rise.\n\nKenwell currently has a $44-$45 floor price target on DOCN and expects shares to rise as high as $53 in the near term.\n\nThe AI Revolution Is Here\n\nIn 1983, the Pew Research Foundation found that middle-income families held 32% of U.S. wealth.\n\nFast forward to today, and everything\u2019s changed. Middle-income families now own 17% of wealth and earn less than half of the country\u2019s aggregate income.\n\nMeanwhile, the share owned by upper-income families has skyrocketed to almost 80%, turning America into a land of \u201chaves\u201d and \u201chave-nots.\u201d\n\nEric Fry calls this the Technochasm.\n\nIt\u2019s a widening gulf between those who have benefited from technological change and those that have suffered or even been replaced.\n\nThe trend is accelerating with artificial intelligence. We\u2019re seeing thousands of jobs getting replaced by generative AI. International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) alone has already announced 7,800 cuts.\n\nAnd the better that artificial intelligence gets, the faster the trend will happen.\n\nThat\u2019s why Louis Navellier, Eric and Luke teamed up and held the AI Impact Event on Thursday.\n\nDuring the event, they discussed the consequences of AI rapid adaptation\u2026 and the huge opportunity that we have if we act right now.\n\nPlus, Louis, Eric, and Luke shared how investors can position themselves to prosper.\n\nIf you missed the event, you can catch the replay here.\n\nAs of this writing, Tom Yeung\u00a0did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

It adds that unauthorized individuals include a developer's family, friends, housemates and household employees.\n\nIf the password-protected headset is being used the Vision Pro must also be in \"positive control\" of the developer\u2014meaning it's either being used by the developer themselves or be in their direct line of sight.\n\nWhen it's not in use, the headset needs to be stored in its locked Pelican case\u2014a waterproof, dustproof and crushproof case that is delivered alongside the Vision Pro\u2014and then placed in a locked space like a room, closet or drawer, that only the developer has access to.\n\nIt can't leave the premises\n\nWhat if the developer wants to take the headset from their home to the office, or vice versa?\n\nNo can do, as the Ts and Cs continue the headset \"may not be moved from or taken away from its ship-to address by you or your authorized developers without Apple's prior written consent.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nThis is a lesson that Apple had to learn the hard way after tech website Gizmodo famously got its hands on an iPhone 4 disguised as a 3GS after it was left in a bar in 2010.\n\nOn top of that, the developer also needs to tell the iPhone maker if they're going to be away from the headset for more than 10 days and must \"consult with [their] Apple point of contact about how to keep the developer kit (DK) safe while you are away.\"\n\nThese measures are underlined with a strict policy on reporting to Apple if the set\u2014be it parts or in its entirety\u2014are stolen or broken, with the brand saying the headset must be returned in good working condition.\n\nFocus on theft was similarly a priority during the launch of the Apple Watch in 2015.\n\nAt the time a developer told Business Insider that a launch event was monitored by security guards at the exit, with attendees required to flash their wrists to the guards when visiting the bathroom or cafeteria to prove they weren't attempting to steal the devices.\n\nKeep it off social media\n\nThe Vision Pro marks Apple's biggest release in almost a decade and was welcomed with the expected fanfare on social media.\n\nBut consumers can't expect to get much more insight on platforms like Twitter once the product is in the hands of developers, as they've explicitly been told to keep their opinions to themselves.\n\nBe it paranoia or sound business sense, Apple isn't taking any risks when it comes to the publication of unapproved content, writing developers are banned from \"discussing, publicly writing about, or reviewing the DK, whether online, in print, in person, or on social media.\n\n\"You may not post, or permit your authorized developers to post, any photos, videos, or reactions to or about the DK.\"\n\nApp developers for the release of the iPad told Insider in 2011 that Apple was so concerned about photo leaks that the wood grain of developer's desks were photographed, so if any images leaked they could be traced back to an individual.\n\nThe developer added that holes had to be drilled into desks so that the iPads could be chained to the furniture with bike cables, and were presented in casing so that only the screens were available.\n\nThe news that certain developers will be able to take home a Vision Pro to test was released in June, with Apple confirming it would also be holding \"open developer labs\" in Cupertino, London, Munich, Shanghai, Singapore, and Tokyo in order to provide developers with hands-on experience to test their apps.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nMore from Fortune: \r\n5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year\u2014all while working from home\r\nLooking to make extra cash?

Instead, many in the market feared a material deterioration in the outlook that would show up in negative guidance and lowered estimates. While we have seen a few reports with downbeat guidance, the overall tone and substance of guidance and management commentary have been favorable.\n\nThe net effect of this is a very stable earnings outlook, even though estimates in the aggregate are still coming down due to a weakening revisions trend for the Energy sector.\n\nYou can see this by comparing earnings estimates for 2023 Q3 as well as full-year 2023 today to where they stood at the start of July and April.\n\nThe expectation today is for 2023 Q3 earnings to be down -2.1% from the same period last year on +0.2% higher revenues. If we exclude the Energy sector, Q3 earnings would be up +3.3% on +3% higher revenues.\n\nOne month ago, on June 27th, the expectation was for Q3 earnings to be down -1.4% on +0.7% higher revenues. Q3 earnings were expected to be up +3.4% on an ex-Energy basis on June 27th.\n\nFour months back, on March 29th, the expectation was for Q3 earnings to be up +0.6% on +0.7% higher revenues. Q3 earnings were expected to be up +4.4% on an ex-Energy basis on March 29th.\n\nThis discussion of evolving aggregate Q3 earnings estimates reflects that while analysts have cut their estimates for the period, a big part of the negative revisions is due to the Energy sector.\n\nWhile estimates in the aggregate for the remaining 15 sectors of the S&P 500 index are essentially unchanged over the past month, there are plenty of cross-currents at the individual sector levels. Specifically, estimates for the Tech, Construction, Autos, Transportation, and Utilities sectors have increased while the same for the other sectors have modestly come down.\n\nRegular readers of our earnings commentary would be familiar with these revisions trends, as we have been flagging them since the start of 2023 Q2. We noticed a significant stabilization in the revisions trend since the beginning of April, which was in contrast to the persistently negative revisions trend that had been in place for about a year prior.\n\nQ2 is on track to be the third consecutive quarter of earnings declines and the first quarter of declining revenues. As noted earlier, a big part of the earnings and revenue weakness is due to the Energy sector. Excluding the Energy sector drag, Q2 earnings would be down -2.9% on +3.6% higher revenues.\n\n2023 Q2 will be the 6th consecutive quarter of declining margins for the S&P 500 index.\n\nMargins in Q2 are expected to be below the year-earlier level for 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with the biggest margin pressure expected to be in the Energy, Medical, Basic Materials, and Construction sectors.\n\nWith the earnings focus lately on the Tech sector, it is instructive to see how much distance has been covered on the margins front in this vital sector.\n\nOn the positive side, margins are on track to be above the year-earlier level for six sectors, with notable gains in the Consumer Discretionary, Finance, and Transportation sectors.\n\nAs noted earlier, the estimate revisions trend has notably stabilized since the start of Q2. In the aggregate, S&P 500 earnings estimates for 2023 have declined -1.6% since the beginning of April but only -0.5% on an ex-Energy basis. Importantly, estimates for sectors like Tech, Construction, Autos, and Transportation have increased in that timeframe.\n\nWe see this favorable turn in the revisions trend as green shoots in the overall earnings landscape and indicative of better days ahead.\n\nQ2 Earnings Scorecard\n\nAs of Friday, July 28th, the Q2 earnings season crossed the halfway mark, with results from 254 S&P 500 members already out. We have a full reporting docket this upcoming week, with more than 1100 companies reporting results, including 169 S&P 500 members. By the end of this week, we will have seen Q2 results from almost 85% of the index members.\n\nThe notable companies reporting this week include Apple, Amazon, Starbucks, Uber and others.\n\nApple's Q2 earnings are expected to be -4.1% below the year-earlier level on -2% lower revenues. The stock has been a standout performer this year, up +50.1% vs. +19.4% for the S&P 500 index. It has been a while since Apple shares were down following a quarterly release. In fact, the last time the stock reacted negatively to a quarterly release was two years ago, in July 2021.\n\nUber, which reports before the market's open on Tuesday, August 1st, has done even better than Apple this year, up +95.6% in the year-to-date period. This is expected to be a milestone quarter for Uber, with the current consensus EPS estimate at breakeven, up from the year-earlier period's -$1.33 loss.\n\nTotal Q2 earnings for the 254 S&P 500 members are down -3.4% from the same period last year on +1.7% higher revenues, with 80.3% beating EPS estimates and 64.6% beating revenue estimates.\n\nThe Apple release after the market's close on Thursday, August 3rd, will keep the Tech sector in focus this week as well. Through Friday, July 28th, we have seen Q2 results from 52% of the sector's total market capitalization in the index. Total earnings for these Tech companies are up +0.4% from the same period last year on +1.5% higher revenues, with 93.8% beating EPS estimates and 75% beating revenue estimates.\n\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>>Strong Tech Results Reflect a Resilient Earnings Picture\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +6.2 average gain per year.

Sales in China of Apple's popular iPhone handset in particular should see a \"small if any decline\" but still remain in line with internal estimates, the analysts predicted.\n\nMeanwhile, they added that \"dynamics around potential soft conditions in China will most likely be built into the guide for the September quarter.\"\n\nEven accounting for potentially weaker returns in China, the analysts said that Apple's projections for September will \"match or slightly exceed [Wall Street] expectations\" thanks in part to strong demand for the iPhone in India.\n\nApple will unveil its latest results on Thursday. Analysts have flagged that recent weakness in consumer demand for discretionary items may hit product sales, although Apple's increasingly important services business -- which features offerings like music, movies and iCloud storage -- is seen supporting margins.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nApple \"well-positioned\" heading into earnings - Piper Sandler\n\nUK regulator seeks public input on Microsoft-Activision deal\n\nDell expands 'Project Helix' with Nvidia to provide generative AI solutions", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-well-positioned-heading-earnings-090002124.html", "symbols": ["AAPL.MX", "AAPL.US", "AAPL34.SA", "APC.F", "APC.XETRA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.903, "neg": 0.062, "neu": 0.829, "pos": 0.108}}, {"date": "2023-07-31T07:40:02+00:00", "title": "Apple, Amazon, Starbucks to Report in Packed Earnings Week", "content": "Apple, Amazon.com and Starbucks will report earnings this week, offering insights into where consumers are spending their money as inflation eases and interest rates rise.

China's State Council on Monday did issue measures to restore and expand consumption in the automobile, real estate and services sector, though this was a long way from the massive fiscal spending markets have been counting on.\n\nBlue chips seemed unperturbed and added 0.6%, bringing gains for July to 4.5%.\n\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan climbed 0.5%, having gained 5.2% so far in July to reach a five-month high.\n\nThe initial impetus for markets was positive following Friday's U.S. data showing an easing in wage costs and core inflation, which fuelled hopes the Federal Reserve was done tightening. \"The data surprises bolster confidence that global core inflation - ex. China - will fall sharply and set the stage for a developed market central policy pause and emerging market easing even if growth remains firm,\" said Bruce Kasman, head of economic research at JPMorgan.\n\nFigures due this week include the U.S. ISM surveys on manufacturing and services, the July payrolls report and European inflation.\n\nThe Bank of England is widely expected to raise rates by at least a quarter point, but markets are more divided on whether the Reserve Bank of Australia will hike or stay on hold.\n\nAlmost 30% of the S&P 500 report results this week and so far, earnings have been good enough to see the index extend its rally to 10% since the start of June.\n\nS&P 500 futures dipped 0.1% on Monday, but the index was still up 2.9% for July, while Nasdaq futures dipped 0.2%. EUROSTOXX 50 futures and FTSE futures both eased 0.4%.\n\nApple Inc and Amazon.com both report on Thursday, while other well-known names with results due include Western Digital Corp, Caterpillar Inc, Starbucks Corp, and Advanced Micro Devices.\n\nPARSING THE BOJ\n\nJapan's Nikkei rose 1.2% to re-take the 33,000 level and nudge closer to its recent three-decade peak.\n\nInvestors are still pondering the implications of Friday's shock decision by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) to lift the lid on bond yields, in a step away from its ultra-easy policies.\n\nAnalysts at BofA estimate the BOJ's bond buying added $1.3 trillion to global liquidity in the past 18 months and provided a low floor for global rates, so any sustained rise in Japanese government bond yields could ripple though other bond markets.\n\nJapanese 10-year yields climbed further to 0.6% on Monday, and toward the new cap of 1.0%. That also put upward pressure on Treasury yields, where the 10-year rose 3 basis points to 3.99%.\n\nWhile the yen had initially rallied on the BOJ move, it soon reversed course as investors still seemed happy to run carry trades, or yen-funded positions in higher-yielding currencies.\n\n\"Friday's action might best be viewed as an attempt to head off a fresh wave of yen-weakening carry trade activity, by at least ceasing to resist pressure for 10-year yields to rise above 0.5%,\" said Ray Attrill, head of FX strategy at National Australia Bank.\n\n\"Friday's actions do, though, fail to provide a catalyst for a secular reversal of yen weakness.\"\n\nThe yen was again under pressure on Monday as the dollar pushed up to 141.87 yen, a long way from Friday's brief low of 138.05.\n\nThe euro had also recovered from its initial pullback to stand at 156.18 yen, while steadying on the dollar at $1.1010 after some wild swings last week.\n\nIn commodities, gold was off a shade at $1,955 an ounce , leaving it 1.8% higher for the month so far.\n\nOil prices took a breather, having risen for five weeks in a row as production cuts by OPEC+ tightened supply.\n\nGoldman Sachs on Sunday revised up its global oil demand forecast for the year while sticking to its 12-month Brent price projection of $93 per barrel.\n\nBrent was off 59 cents at $84.40 a barrel, while U.S. crude eased 31 cents to $80.27.\n\n(Reporting by Wayne Cole; Editing by Jamie Freed and Himani Sarkar)", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-markets-asia-shares-china-054751050.html", "symbols": ["AAPL.MX", "AAPL.US", "AAPL34.SA", "APC.F", "APC.XETRA", "GSPC.INDX"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.989, "neg": 0.048, "neu": 0.858, "pos": 0.095}}, {"date": "2023-07-31T05:26:54+00:00", "title": "Amazon and Apple earnings ahead, U.S. jobs report looms -- what's moving markets", "content": "Investing.com -- U.S. stocks point higher ahead of a week of major corporate results and key economic data. Amazon and Apple are set to round out a multi-week crush of earnings from Big Tech, while nonfarm payroll figures for July could provide clues into the impact of over a year of Federal Reserve policy tightening.\n\n1. Futures edge higher\n\nU.S. stock futures inched up on Monday, but stayed close to the flatline, as investors looked ahead to a fresh batch of tech earnings and key U.S. employment data this week.\n\nAt 05:12 ET (09:12 GMT), the Dow futures contract had gained 18 points or 0.05%, S&P futures added 4 points or 0.08%, and Nasdaq 100 futures moved up by 8 points or 0.05%.\n\nThe main indices remain on track to post monthly gains before the final trading day of July. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which saw its longest win streak since 1987 snapped last week, is up 3.1% this month, while the S&P 500 has climbed 3% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has added 3.8%.\n\nAs July turns to August, traders are awaiting earnings later in the week from Amazon and Apple, as well as chipmakers AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM).\n\nMeanwhile, the crucial U.S. nonfarm payrolls report for July is due out on Friday, with economists predicting that the world's biggest economy added fewer jobs compared to the prior month.\n\n2. Amazon and Apple results ahead\n\nE-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and iPhone-maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) will both report their latest quarterly results on Thursday, rounding out a wave of closely-watched Big Tech earnings in recent weeks.\n\nFocus will likely hover around how the companies' revenue flows fared during a three-month period marked by economic uncertainty that has persuaded some businesses and individuals to rein in spending.\n\nFor Amazon, attention will likely turn to its all-important cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services, where growth decelerated in the previous quarter. Amazon has also flagged that the slowdown at the division continued into April.\n\nApple, meanwhile, will deliver its first results since the unveiling of its highly-anticipated Vision Pro headset in June. Despite the excitement around the device, weaker consumer demand is expected to weigh on other products like the iPhone and iPad.\n\nAnalysts may also be keen to question Amazon and Apple executives about their plans for artificial intelligence (AI). Last week, tech peers Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) cautioned that spending levels may soon rise as they race to develop AI tools.\n\n3. U.S. jobs report highlights economic calendar\n\nHiring in the U.S. is projected to have slowed in July, but the job market is expected to remain relatively tight even in the face of aggressive Federal Reserve interest rate hikes.\n\nEconomists predict that total nonfarm employment rose by 200,000 during the month, down from the June reading of 209,000, while the jobless rate is expected to remain steady at 3.6%.\n\nThe labor market has been a major focus of the Fed's long-standing monetary tightening campaign, with policymakers arguing that a loosening in employer demand could help alleviate inflationary pressures. The Fed increased interest rates by 25 basis points last week, but suggested that any future decisions would be \"data-dependent.\"\n\nDespite signs of moderation, job growth has remained robust in recent months. The strength has in turn fueled speculation that the Fed may be able to engineer a so-called \"soft landing\" -- corralling inflation without sparking a meltdown in the broader economy.\n\nFriday's figures may provide more clarity on this key question.\n\n4. SEC asked Coinbase to halt all non-Bitcoin trading - FT\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission requested that Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) cease trading in all digital tokens except for Bitcoin prior to filing a lawsuit against the cryptocurrency exchange, according to the Financial Times.\n\nIn an interview, Coinbase Chief Executive Brian Armstrong told the paper that the SEC \"said...we believe every asset other than bitcoin is a security.\" Armstrong added that the regulators then asked that Coinbase delist all of the more than 200 tokens it offers to customers, apart from Bitcoin.\n\nArmstrong refuted the claim, saying that agreeing to the shutdowns \"would have essentially meant the end of the crypto industry in the U.S.\" Instead, he said Coinbase decided to challenge the SEC's assertions in court.\n\nThe SEC has been angling to gain more control over the crypto industry, with Chair Gary Gensler arguing that most cryptocurrencies qualify as securities, or tradeable financial assets. Coinbase was sued by the SEC last month for failing to register as a broker.\n\nShould the SEC win this case, it could set a precedent for the power regulators in the U.S. have over crypto businesses and potentially lead to more stringent compliance rules.\n\nFor its part, the SEC told the FT that its enforcement division did not make formal requests for \"companies to delist crypto assets.\" It also declined to comment on what the delisting would mean for the crypto industry.\n\n5. Walmart boosts Flipkart stake - WSJ\n\nRetail giant Walmart (NYSE:WMT) has further cemented its interest in Flipkart through a $1.4 billion purchase of shares from a major investor in the Indian e-commerce group, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nWalmart bought New York-based hedge fund Tiger Global's remaining shares in Flipkart, the paper reported, citing a letter sent by Tiger to its investors. The transaction valued Flipkart at $35B, down from the almost $38B attached by Tiger to the company in 2021.\n\nMeanwhile, Walmart also bought out private equity firm Accel's remaining 1% stake in Flipkart, the Economic Times newspaper reported, although the size of the purchase was unknown.\n\nThe moves boost Walmart's exposure to Flipkart at a time when the Arkansas-based company is looking to expand its presence in the digital commerce space. Walmart paid $16B more than five years ago for an initial 77% stake in Flipkart, a wide-ranging business catering to more than 450 million customers.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAmazon and Apple earnings ahead, U.S. jobs report looms -- what's moving markets\n\nAnalysis-Dwindling excess savings could scupper markets' soft-landing hopes\n\nCanada's Trudeau sets sights on fourth election fight with Cabinet refresh", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-apple-earnings-ahead-u-052654020.html", "symbols": ["AAPL.MX", "AAPL.US", "AAPL34.SA", "AMD.US", "AMZ.F", "AMZ.XETRA", "AMZN.MX", "AMZN.US", "AMZO34.SA", "APC.F", "APC.XETRA", "COIN.US", "GOOGL.US", "META.US", "MSFT.US", "QCOM.US", "WALM34.SA", "WMT.F"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.998, "neg": 0.035, "neu": 0.846, "pos": 0.119}}, {"date": "2023-07-31T02:18:55+00:00", "title": "Dow Jones Futures Fall After Market Rally Powers Higher; Apple, Tesla Lead Stocks To Watch", "content": "The market rally had some wobbles amid big news, but powered for solid weekly gains.

We will also cover some interesting insights on the latest trends in green technology. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to 5Biggest Green Tech Companies in the World.\n\nHow Important Is Green Energy Investment?\n\nThe financialization of green energy has proven to be an undeniable success, with both China and the U.S. emerging as global leaders in attracting capital to fuel the energy sector's transformation. China, in particular, has been remarkably successful, with a staggering $546 billion in green energy investments in 2022, while the U.S. trailed behind with $141 billion.\n\nMoreover, renewable energy has undergone a remarkable transformation. Once deemed costly and risky, heavily subsidized, it has become more affordable than certain traditional fossil fuel sources. Developments in mitigating intermittency issues and energy storage have played an equally pivotal role in this transformation and have raised the possibility that renewables could become the primary electricity source in the next 20-30 years.\n\nThe Latest Trends in Green Technology\n\nThe eco-friendly solutions like electric vehicles and solar power which once considered niche or unconventional, have now gained mainstream acceptance as part of the collective effort to combat climate change. The Climate Tech 2020 Report, published by PwC, highlighted a massive shift in investment trends. In 2013, venture capital investments in decarbonization solutions amounted to $418 million, but this figure soared to an impressive $16.1 billion in 2019. Subsequently, the momentum continued, with an exceptional $87.5 billion invested in climate tech between July 2020 and July 2021, as reported in the Climate Tech 2021 Report.\n\nCorporations have undergone an equally pertinent evolution in their corporate responsibility initiatives, placing a much stronger emphasis on sustainability. For instance, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) has taken notable steps to address climate change which is also evident in the eco-routing feature of Google Maps, that has already resulted in a reduction of over 500,000 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nStory continues\n\nSimilarly, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has made pertinent contributions in reducing its carbon footprint in its operations and is actively working towards a carbon-neutral goal by the year 2030. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) also encourages its suppliers to adopt clean energy practices. Through their Power for Impact program, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is dedicated to facilitating access to clean energy for communities worldwide. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is considered one of the greenest tech companies.\n\nMoreover, green hydrogen is emerging as a leading force in the clean energy transition and has gained a significant traction and recognition as the energy of the future. In 2023, numerous major green hydrogen projects are set to reach final investment decisions or commence construction, which signifies a shift from theoretical discussions to large-scale reality.\n\nThe momentum behind green hydrogen is further amplified by a surge of government subsidy schemes worldwide. The US hydrogen tax credits alone offer up to $3 per kilogram of green hydrogen to producers and promise substantial support. Additionally, the EU and UK Contracts for Difference subsidy programs and Germany's H2Global scheme will also provide financial assistance for clean hydrogen imports.\n\nDigital technology, particularly Artificial Internet of Things (AIoT), also plays a crucial role in accelerating the transition to green hydrogen. The World Economic Forum suggests that AIoT-enabled solutions can cut capital and operating expenses by up to 25%, expediting the commercial viability of green hydrogen by four to seven years. As investments rise and government backing strengthens, the future of green hydrogen is undoubtedly promising.\n\nClean Energy Projects in the US\n\nIn August 2022, the US enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 to curb inflation, reduce the budget deficit, and invest in domestic clean energy production. According to a report by Climate Power, Georgia ranks second in the U.S. for new private-sector clean energy projects since the Inflation Reduction Act's passage, with 22 projects and 16,678 expected jobs. Michigan leads with 24 projects, while Kansas expects 20,600 jobs. The law has been praised for boosting green energy investments and driving development. However, Governor Brian Kemp criticized the law for having little impact on EV and battery manufacturing expansion. 15 Biggest Green Tech Companies in the World\n\nIkonoklast Fotografie/Shutterstock.com\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo list the biggest green tech companies in the world, we targeted pure play companies in green technologies and made a list of 20 such companies.

China - will fall sharply and set the stage for a developed market central bank policy pause and emerging market easing even if growth remains firm,\" said Bruce Kasman, head of economic research at JPMorgan.\n\nFigures due this week include the U.S. ISM surveys on manufacturing and services, the July payrolls report and European inflation. China factory surveys are due later on Monday.\n\nThe Bank of England is widely expected to raise rates by at least a quarter point, but markets are more divided on whether the Reserve Bank of Australia will hike or stay on hold.\n\nAlmost 30% of the S&P 500 report results this week and, so far, earnings have been good enough to see the index extend its rally to 10% since the start of June.\n\nS&P 500 futures added another 0.1% on Monday, bringing its gains for July to almost 3%, with Nasdaq futures up 0.2%.\n\nApple Inc and Amazon.com both report on Thursday, while other well-known names with results due include Western Digital Corp, Caterpillar Inc, Starbucks Corp, and Advanced Micro Devices.\n\nAsian markets have also been trending higher, with China's benchmark index enjoying a 4.5% jump last week on hopes for more stimulus from Beijing.\n\nEarly on Monday, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan edged up 0.1%, having gained 4.9% so far in July to reach a five-month high.\n\nPARSING THE BOJ\n\nJapan's Nikkei rose 1.0% to re-take the 33,000 level and nudge closer to its recent three-decade peak.\n\nInvestors are still pondering the implications of Friday's shock decision by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) to lift the lid on bond yields, in a step away from its ultra-easy policies.\n\nAnalysts at BofA estimate the BOJ's bond buying added $1.3 trillion to global liquidity in the past 18 months and provided a low floor for global rates, so any sustained rise in Japanese government bond yields could ripple though other bond markets.\n\nJapanese 10-year yields climbed further to 0.6% on Monday, still short of the new cap of 1.0% and limiting the boost to the yen. While the yen initially rallied on the BOJ move, it soon reversed course, and the dollar climbed from 138.05 yen to as high as 141.18 late on Friday.\n\nOn Monday, the dollar was off slightly at 140.78 yen , with investors still seeming happy to run carry trades, or yen-funded positions in higher-yielding currencies.\n\n\"Friday's action might best be viewed as an attempt to head off a fresh wave of yen-weakening carry trade activity, by at least ceasing to resist pressure for 10-year yields to rise above 0.5%,\" said Ray Attrill, head of FX strategy at National Australia Bank.\n\n\"Friday's actions do, though, fail to provide a catalyst for a secular reversal of yen weakness.\"\n\nThe euro had also recovered from its initial pullback to stand at 155.17 yen, while steadying at $1.1026 after some wild swings last week.\n\nIn commodities, gold was steady at $1,957 an ounce, having gained around 2% for the month so far.\n\nOil prices have climbed for five weeks in a row as production cuts by OPEC+ tightened supply.\n\nBrent was off 9 cents on Monday at $84.90 a barrel, while U.S. crude eased 6 cents to $80.52.\n\n(Reporting by Wayne Cole; Editing by Jamie Freed)", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-markets-asia-shares-extend-004215487.html", "symbols": ["AAPL.MX", "AAPL.US", "AAPL34.SA", "APC.F", "APC.XETRA", "GSPC.INDX"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.99, "neg": 0.033, "neu": 0.869, "pos": 0.098}}]
