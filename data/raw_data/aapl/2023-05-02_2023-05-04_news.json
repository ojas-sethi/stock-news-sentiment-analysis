Though the sales fell 2.5% in the period, the company had warned investors to expect a drop of roughly twice that.\n\nThe results suggest that Apple is beginning to recover from a slump that\u2019s plagued both the computer and smartphone industries. It\u2019s a particular relief for investors after Qualcomm Inc., a key supplier, raised fresh concerns about phone demand earlier this week. Apple\u2019s sales in China \u2014 a weak spot for other tech companies \u2014 also came in a bit better than expected.\n\nAs expected, Apple announced plans for $90 billion in stock repurchases \u2014 the same as last year\u2019s plan. The company also raised its quarterly dividend 4% to 24 cents a share.\n\nThe shares gained 2% in late trading after the report was released. They had closed at $165.79, up 28% for the year.\n\nThough the performance was better than expected, it marked two straight quarters of sales declines \u2014 a first for Apple since the pandemic began. Earnings, meanwhile, were unchanged from a year earlier, at $1.52 a share. That compared with an average estimate of $1.43 a share.\n\nOn a conference call with analysts, Apple said that revenue in the current period would drop by a similar amount as in the past quarter, which ended April 1. That suggests a dip of about 3%. The company also said it would continue to see a negative impact from foreign exchange rates.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple generated $51.3 billion in sales from the iPhone \u2014 its flagship product \u2014 in the second quarter, topping analyst predictions of $49 billion. That\u2019s just a 1.5% rise from a year ago but marked a record performance for a March quarter, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said. The increase came \u201cdespite the challenging macroeconomic environment,\u201d he said in the statement.\n\nLike many tech CEOs delivering earnings reports, Cook also discussed artificial intelligence. He said it had enormous potential and that Apple would continue weaving it into products in a \u201cvery thoughtful\u201d way.\n\nRead More: Apple\u2019s Tim Cook Says AI Concerns Still Need to Be Sorted Out\n\nFrom a supply perspective, the second quarter was an opportunity for the iPhone 14 to rebound. The device had suffered from constraints during the previous period due to Covid policies in China.\n\nThe iPad saw revenue fall 13% to $6.67 billion, roughly in line with estimates of $6.7 billion. New models, which included a revamped entry-level version and Pro models with M2 chips, didn\u2019t do much to spur purchases in the quarter.\n\nLikewise, revenue in the Mac division dropped 31% to $7.17 billion. That trailed forecasts of $7.7 billion. Research firms already warned that it was a bleak quarter for the lineup, with IDC estimating that Mac shipments fell about 40% in the quarter. Apple had updated the MacBook Pro and Mac mini, adding faster processors, but they failed to reignite the unit\u2019s sales.\n\nThe home, wearables and accessories division, which includes AirPods, the Apple Watch and the TV set-top box \u2014 fell less than 1% to $8.76 billion. That beat estimates of $8.5 billion. The company added a faster processor to the Apple TV during the holiday quarter and updated its HomePod speaker during the March quarter.\n\nThe services business, which includes iCloud, Apple Music, the App Store and the TV+ streaming service, brought in $20.91 billion, missing estimates of $21.1 billion. Still, it was a 5.5% gain from a year earlier. Last quarter, Apple promised that services revenue \u2014 alongside the iPhone \u2014 would accelerate.\n\nThe company did particularly well in emerging markets, Cook said, pointing to record quarterly sales in Mexico, Indonesia, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates. And the company\u2019s overall sales would have been up if you held currencies constant, he said.\n\nFor Apple and other US companies with a global footprint, a strong dollar has decreased the value of revenue generated in other parts of the world.\n\n\u201cDespite these challenges, we continue to manage for the long term,\u201d Cook said.\n\n(Updates with additional CEO remarks in last two paragraphs.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nTwitter\u2019s Unpaid Bills Threaten to Be an Even Bigger Problem for Elon Musk How a Dishwasher Engineer Challenged Elon Musk\u2019s Grip on Commercial Space Too Big to Fail, But Not Too Big to Bail Out Other Banks The Company Behind Ben Shapiro Is Trying to Build a Right-Wing Magic Kingdom Cadillac\u2019s Lyriq EV Might Be a Winner If GM Can Build Enough of Them\n\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-iphone-bounces-back-helping-224910213.html", "symbols": ["AAPL.MX", "AAPL.US", "AAPL34.SA", "APC.F", "APC.XETRA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.978, "neg": 0.048, "neu": 0.87, "pos": 0.081}}, {"date": "2023-05-04T22:27:52+00:00", "title": "Apple suffers back-to-back sales slump in cost of living squeeze", "content": "It comes as the iPhone-maker gears up for a push into virtual reality - AP Photo/Kathy Willens\n\nApple has reported its second straight drop in revenues as the rising cost of living hits sales of its high-end devices.\n\nThe US tech giant, the world\u2019s biggest company by market value, said last night that revenues had fallen by 3pc to $94.8bn (\u00a375.4bn) in the first three months of the year. Profits dropped by 3.4pc to $24.2bn.\n\nThe results were the first time in four years, and only the third time in a decade, that Apple has recorded two consecutive falls in sales, with chief executive Tim Cook pointing to a \u201cchallenging macroeconomic environment\u201d.\n\nHowever, the drop was not as severe as Wall Street had forecast and iPhone sales unexpectedly rose.\n\nSales of the iPhone, which make up the majority of Apple\u2019s revenue, rose by 1.5pc. Revenues from its Mac computers dropped by more than 30pc and sales of its iPad tablets fell by 13pc.\n\nApple\u2019s shares climbed slightly in after-hours trading as the company committed to a further $90bn in share buybacks.\n\nIts wearables and accessories business, which includes the company\u2019s smartwatch and AirPod headphones, also fell slightly. Apple's powerhouse services division, which includes sales from its App Store and iCloud, rose by 5pc.\n\nApple shares have risen by a third this year. While the company\u2019s Big Tech rivals such as Meta, Google and Amazon have been forced to cut thousands of jobs, Apple has avoided mass layoffs.\n\nHowever, sales of computers and tablets have been hit by a lull in consumer demand after the pandemic, when many splashed out on new devices as they worked and attended school from home.\n\nIt comes as Apple gears up for a push into virtual reality by unveiling a high-end headset, its first major product launch in almost a decade.\n\nThe company is expected to unveil the device, which has been years in the making, at its annual software conference next month.\n\nApple\u2019s long-rumoured VR headset is expected to first cater to professional users and come with a steep price tag before the company unveils consumer versions in the coming years. The device is likely to combine virtual reality with \u201caugmented reality\u201d which projects virtual objects onto a view of the real world.\n\nMr Cook said: \u201cWe are pleased to report an all-time record in services and a March quarter record for iPhone despite the challenging macroeconomic environment, and to have our installed base of active devices reach an all-time high.\u201d\n\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

Don\u2019t take my word for it, though. See with your own eyes:\r\n\r\nThe world\u2019s largest gadget maker, Apple Inc. AAPL, recorded beats for both earnings in its fiscal Q2 \u2014 $1.52 per share versus $1.44 anticipated \u2014 and quarterly sales \u2014 $94.84 billion versus $93.32 billion expected. The iPhone alone brought in $51.33 billion for the three months reported, +1.5%, while the Mac and iPad continued to slow down: -31% and -13%, respectively. Services came in more than +5% higher year over year to $20.91 billion, but were still slightly below expectations.\r\n\r\nGross Margins of 44.3% were moderately better than the estimated 44.1%, as demand strength continues forward. Apple sees strength in China and especially India, where the company is reportedly expanding production. The company is also instituting a $90 billion share buyback and a dividend increase of 4% to 24 cents per share. Shares have gained +1.4% on the news in the after-market.\r\n\r\nExpedia EXPE actually missed expectations on both top and bottom lines \u2014 negative earnings of -20 cents per share missed the $0.00 expected on $2.67 billion in sales, which was marginally shy of the Zacks consensus $2.69 billion. But the company sees Gross Bookings up +20%, and the company is buying back $600 million in shares, which has helped send EXPE stock +1.5% in late trading.\r\n\r\nExpedia-competitor Booking.com BKNG shares are on an opposing track: the company beat estimates on both top and bottom lines, but shares are down in the after-market: earnings of $11.16 per share were above the $10.62 expected, on $3.78 billion which took out the $3.74 billion consensus. Gross Travel Bookings continued their strong trajectory from Q4, +44% year over year. But shares are giving back around -3% of the +28% growth in the stock, year to date.\r\n\r\nDoorDash DASH shares have been ping-ponging on the news of its Q1 report, posting a better-than-expected loss of -41 cents per share from the -56 projected, on $2.04 billion in revenues which outpaced the $1.92 billion expected, +40% year over year. Gross Order Volume grew +29% year over year, with Total Orders +27% \u2014 another company holding onto its strength from the previous quarter. Shares have moved from -7% after the release to +4% at this hour.\r\n\r\nLyft LYFT is not so lucky at this hour \u2014 even on both top- and bottom-line beats in Q1: a positive +$0.07 per share versus an expected -$0.09 on $1.00 billion in sales which surpassed the $976.9 million anticipated, shares are tumbling -13% in late trading. Revenue guidance for Q2 is lighter than initial expected in our Zacks consensus, with adjusted EBITDA guidance notably lower than previously thought.\r\n\r\nCoinbase COIN is seeing a big pop in the after-market: +6% on much-better-than-expected results in Q1: a loss per share of -34 cents is much better than the forecast -$1.44, and $773 million in quarterly revenues easily outpaced the $652.8 million consensus. Cost-cutting and a jump in subscriber revenue assisted Coinbase\u2019s healthy quarter, although the company projects lower subscriber growth for the ongoing quarter.\r\n\r\nFinally, Block SQ \u2014 cash payment platform and parent of Cash App, formerly known as Square Inc. \u2014 decisively outperformed expectations on both top and bottom lines after today\u2019s close: earnings of 40 cents per share bettered the 31 cents predicted, while revenues of $4.99 billion swept past the $4.58 billion analysts were looking for. Full-year guidance is also improved, as customer engagement remains strong. Shares are +3.5% in late trading at this hour.\r\n\r\nQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

Davidson Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst Tom Forte joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss Apple's Q2 earnings.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nTOM FORTE: So my first take is that the results are favorable, as we anticipated, to the extent that the reopening in China had Apple well positioned from a supply chain standpoint and a demand standpoint when you think about 10% of revenues are to Chinese consumers. I also think they got an added boost from foreign exchange rates when you think about how when compared to the December quarter, the US dollar weakened against the pound, the euro, and the yen. So good results from Apple, which is very encouraging.\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: On that international picture there, Tom, when you talk about the Chinese market, I mean, how much of this is kind of the tip of the iceberg? How do you see this momentum carrying into the current quarter just given that how much time has passed since China has essentially switched, or shifted, their COVID policy?\n\nTOM FORTE: I think the good news is that the March quarter results suggest that the challenges they had from a supply chain standpoint, and from a demand standpoint, that those sales shifted into the March quarter instead of being lost entirely. So I do think that there's another opportunity for more of those sales to be shifted into the June quarter, the next fiscal quarter, for Apple. So I think there could be additional momentum on the Chinese reopening trade for Apple.\n\nSEANA SMITH: Tom, when it comes to some of the moves that Apple has made over the last several weeks, and really months, diversifying its manufacturing footprint, really trying to move some of its production, more of its production, out of China, what do you make of that move there? And we talk about a potential catalyst here for Apple going forward. Or what could really maintain the momentum that we've seen since the start of the year? How big of a boost do you think could potentially be provided by India?\n\nStory continues\n\nTOM FORTE: Yeah, so the good news for Apple is that they have the playbook for India to some large degree, which is China. So long term, were the company to be able to rely on India significantly for its supply chain to a much greater extent than it does today, and generate 5% to 10% of sales to consumers in India, that would be a tremendous success.\n\nI do think, though, that's going to take a very long time. One, to switch their supply chain to be less dependent on China, and two, on a relative basis, there's more consumers in China with higher discretionary income today than India. So basically, they need the emerging market of India to grow so more consumers there can afford Apple's products.\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: Tom, let me push back on that a bit because we have heard that argument before about the playbook from China translating to the playbook in India. The reality is over the years, that just hasn't necessarily materialized. What has changed this time around that gives you more optimism in the Indian market? Because Apple's been trying for years to compete in a big way.\n\nTOM FORTE: So I would agree to the extent that Apple is yet to come up with an inexpensive iPhone to penetrate the market in India, which is very dominated by Android devices. What has changed, I think, is that Apple realizes that it has to diversify its supply chain so it's less dependent on China. I think that's what's changed. So I'd argue that maybe there's a greater necessity here. And because of the greater necessity, Apple will place more of an emphasis on it. And then over time, that will lead to ultimate success.\n\nSEANA SMITH: Tom, why don't you think we're seeing more of a reaction in shares after hours? Because when you take a look at the stock right now, it's pretty muted given the fact that it beat an almost, not all, but almost all categories here.\n\nTOM FORTE: So an argument can be made that the good news was already in the shares to the extent that if you look at the performance of Apple stock in the calendar first quarter, it had one of its best quarters in many years. Now, I think that was the combination of the reopening trade in China and also expectations that the Federal Reserve is at or near an end in raising interest rates. So I think you could argue that the muted reaction after hours is a reflection of the strong performance year to date in shares of Apple.\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: Tom, I'm curious to get your take on Apple in this high savings yield account. I mean, we have heard that initial push here, reportedly attracted a billion dollars in deposits. I mean, I realize this is a long-term play. But really, what is the play for Apple? And how significant is this banking business going to be?\n\nTOM FORTE: So it's something I've been thinking about a lot. And I will admit that I was initially too pessimistic on Apple Pay. I didn't think that Apple Pay would become so prevalent as it is today. So I think I had the same initial reaction to this very high savings rate account that Apple's offering. The suggestion that there's a billion already in those accounts is very encouraging. But I do look, in that case, for more information on the earnings call to find out, what is the strategy? And why is it so important to offer such a high rate on these savings accounts?\n\nAnd what will that-- how will that help Apple? I know they want to become the digital wallet. But is it really necessary to have such a high interest rate to advance that effort? And that's unclear to me right now.\n\nSEANA SMITH: Tom, what do you think about the fact that Apple just has been pretty light on the product side as of late? That has been the criticism that people that have been neutral on stock, bearish on the stock, have been pointing to. How critical is it, do you think, that Apple really ramps up that side of the business, the product side, with new innovation, and quickly?\n\nTOM FORTE: I do think it's important from a long-term standpoint. They've benefited tremendously from the 5G network upgrade. And an argument could be made they've only had marginal improvements for the last couple generations of iPhones. I am of the belief that at some point in time, they will expand their product lineup to include an augmented reality, virtual reality, product, and then further down the road, automobile, a self-driving automobile.\n\nAnd I think at some point in time, the stock's going to need incremental new products to sustain revenue growth to sustain the stock's performance. So I do think that's important over the long term.\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: Tom, always good to talk to you and get your take. Tom Forte with D.A. Davidson joining us there on Apple.

Currently, a handful of companies dominate the BNPL space. However, new and notable companies are entering the sector, especially in financial technology (fintech), attracted by the prospect of big profits. That has Investors looking into which BNPL fintech stock picks will net them the largest returns.\n\nSome consumer groups and lawmakers criticize the BNPL industry\u2019s business model of providing high-interest loans to consumers that they must repay in equal installments over a set period of time. The critics claim that BNPL traps consumers in a cycle of debt that can be difficult to break. Some buy now, pay later firms have been accused of predatory lending practices and politicians in Washington, D.C. continue to threaten regulatory action against the industry. Despite those issues, BNPL continues to be a popular payment option, particularly among consumers under age 35.\n\nHere are the three most promising BNPL fintech growth stocks to watch in May 2023.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shop. Apple Layoffs\n\nSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com\n\nU.S. technology giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has launched a new buy now, pay later service that allows consumers to split purchases into four equal payments spread over a six-week period. Called Apple Pay Later, the new service enables people to track and repay their loans using their digital Apple Wallet. Users can apply for loans from Apple for anywhere from $50 to $1,000 and use those loans for in-app and online purchases. Apple is touting that payments made through its new BNPL service have no interest and no fees.\n\nApple is also promoting that consumers can apply for a loan within the Apple Wallet app without it impacting their credit score. Additionally, merchants that accept Apple Pay do not need to make any changes to implement the new BNPL service. The move into buy now, pay later comes as Apple moves deeper into banking and online finance. Shortly after its BNPL service was announced, Apple came out with a new high-interest savings account that offers 4.15% interest on deposits. AAPL stock has increased 7% in the last 12 months.\n\nStory continues\n\nPayPal (PYPL) PayPal logo and front of headquarters. PYPL stock\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nFintech giant PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) is all-in on BNPL, what they call Pay In 4. The company announced last summer that it is pushing further into buy now, pay later by offering installment loans on bigger purchases. Consumers can now make monthly installment payments on purchases of $199 to $10,000 for up to two years. However, as with most BNPL services, the interest charged by PayPal on these larger loans is not cheap and could be as high as 29.99%. Consumers also need credit approval to secure a bigger loan.\n\nPayPal has been in the BNPL fintech space for going on three years now. It originally followed the path of other companies, offering consumers small loans that they could repay in four equal payments spread over six weeks. But now, the company is branching out with larger loans and repayment periods spread across longer time frames. While some analysts call the strategy risky, PayPal has benefited from BNPL, processing more than 100 million transactions worth more than $15 billion since 2020. PYPL stock is down 20% over the last 12 months.\n\nAffirm Holdings (AFRM) Affirm (AFRM) logo displayed on a smartphone. AFRM Layoffs\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt\u2019s had a rough ride, but there may now be signs that the stock of BNPL company Affirm Holdings (NASDAQ:AFRM) has bottomed. Year-to-date, AFRM stock is flat with its share price hovering just below $10 since the start of the year. Any movement higher at this point would be welcomed by shareholders following a 70% plunge in the share price over the past 12 months.\n\nHolding AFRM stock back is the fact that the BNPL company behind it remains unprofitable. However, Affirm continues to grow at a fast rate, announcing in February that the number of consumers using its buy now, pay later service rose an incredible 150% year-over-year to 11.2 million people. Revenues generated in its most recent quarter were up 77% from a year ago at $361 million. While Affirm is still operating in the red and remains in start-up mode, its BNPL business shows signs of continued strength.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held a long position in AAPL.

The latter coming at a crucial time amid banking upheaval. Let's kill two birds with one stone though. Apple is now Berkshire's biggest holdings, so what happens since Buffett bought into it? Here is Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer. Josh?\n\nJOSH SCHAFER: So Berkshire Hathaway first bought Apple stock in 2016. And if you followed the Oracle of Omaha and invested $10,000 when Buffett first bought Apple, you now have almost $70,000. So Buffett missed the launch of the iPhone and the ensuing product boom in Cupertino, but instead, he's ridden the most recent wave of Apple's growth driven by revenue boosts, and services, and wearables. Those segments have grown roughly 300% since Buffett first bought.\n\nBerkshire's purchase came the year Apple launched AirPods. Then, in 2019, Apple introduced both its Apple Card on Apple TV+. Those kinds of services have helped bring customers further into the Apple ecosystem, a concept Buffett is bullish on. It hasn't all been rosy for Buffett. He sold some shares prior to the annual meeting in 2021, and in 2022, production of the iPhone was cut short by unrest at Apple's factory in China. But the Oracle seems poised to ride along Apple's next leg of growth as the tech titan opened its first store in India and just launched a high yield savings account with Goldman Sachs last month. He may even benefit from what could be Apple's biggest product yet as all eyes are now on a rumored AR headset potentially launching later this year.\n\n- Josh Schafer, thank you so much.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/video/apple-stock-inside-look-berkshire-155558061.html", "symbols": ["AAPL.MX", "AAPL.US", "AAPL34.SA", "APC.F", "APC.XETRA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.958, "neg": 0.023, "neu": 0.893, "pos": 0.084}}, {"date": "2023-05-04T14:47:25+00:00", "title": "S&amp;P 500 wobbles as PacWest-led slump in banks stokes worries; Apple earnings eyed", "content": "Investing.com -- The S&P 500 slipped Thursday as fresh turmoil in the banking sector weighed on investor sentiment ahead of Apple quarterly results due after markets close.\n\nThe S&P 500 was down 0.8%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1%, or 345 points lower, and the Nasdaq slipped 0.5%.\n\nA trio of regional banks including Western Alliance Bancorporation (NYSE:WAL), First Horizon National Corporation (NYSE:FHN), and PacWest were nursing heavy losses as concerns the latter may on the brink of collapse sparked fresh concerns about troubles in the banking sector.\n\nPacWest Bancorp (NASDAQ:PACW) fell more than 40% on reports that the regional bank was exploring strategic options including a possible sale.

For more stocks, head on over to 5 Small-Cap Mining Stocks Hedge Funds Are Avoiding.\n\nThe global economy is highly interlinked as it relies on thousands of firms scattered all over the world to make both basic and advanced products. A large variety of items ranging from Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s smartphones and laptops to Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s electric cars, and Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)'s advanced fighter jets require basic materials without which these technologically advanced products would not be produced.\n\nAt the heart of these industries is the mining industry. From gold to silver, lithium, and rare earth metals such as cerium, yttrium, and scandium, these products use the metals within the production process. Safe to say, the mining industry, in addition to oil and gas exploration, is one of the most important sectors in the world.\n\nAdditionally, the boom in the demand for electric vehicles, along with government incentives to shift to electric vehicles within the next couple of decades is also expected to vastly grow the demand for lithium. A report from the International Energy Agency (IEA) takes a look at the different stimulants for different minerals industries such as silver, copper, lithium, and rare earths. It outlines that while copper continues to be the dominant material for conducting electricity due to its superior electrochemical properties, currently, copper producers are reaching their peak capacity, which will lead to a rise in global copper prices. Comparing this report on the copper industry with growth and revenue estimates for the copper mining industry, a research report from Maximize Market Research corroborates these findings. Its compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) estimate for the copper industry is one of the lowest that we have come across, with the research firm estimating that between 2022 and 2029, the industry will grow by a mere 0.80%. This will cause its value to grow by only $5 billion between 2021 and 2029, or from $75.56 billion to $80.60 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoving forward to rare earth metals, the IEA estimates that the rare earth industry is dominated by China and that poor environmental care in processing these materials is a concern. At the same time, it adds that within the rare earth industry, there is a severe risk of demand mismatch between the metals themselves. It points out that while the demand for neodymium (most commonly used to manufacture magnets as part of an alloy with boron and iron) will be high, the demand for other metals such as cerium (used in bulbs and televisions) will be low. This is a concerning fact since rare earth metals are not found individually, and instead are clumped together.\n\nTherefore, the rare earth metal companies have to mine all of them and carry the risk of having large inventories of some materials while having to mine more due to running short in others. Combining this with market research reports, a study from The Business Research Company points out that the rare earth metals industry was worth $6.58 billion in 2022 and will grow to $7.29 billion this year through a CAGR of 10.8%. It adds that from 2023 to 2027, the industry will grow at a slower CAGR of 7.1% and be worth $9.6 billion at the end of the forecast period. Building on this, Future Market Insights shares that magnets held a 30% market share in the industry in 2022 (corroborating the IEA's claim) with neodymium itself commanding a 70% market share during the same year. Some companies that operate in the rare earth industry are Arafura Rare Earths Limited (OTCMKTS:ARAFF), Lynas Rare Earths Limited (OTCMKTS:LYSCF), and Alkane Resources Limited (OTCMKTS:ALKEF).\n\nMoving forward to the world's current favorite mineral, lithium, there is expected to be a serious demand and supply mismatch in the industry. Naturally, this also leads to some high growth estimates for the industry, with a research report from Market.us estimating that the global lithium market was worth $5.2 billion in 2022 and will grow by an 8.9% CAGR between 2023 and 2032 to sit at an estimated $12 billion by the end of the forecast period. The aforementioned demand and supply mismatch is clear when we take a look at the global market for lithium ion batteries, which are used in both electric vehicles and in gadgets. On this front, research from Spherical Insights estimates a whopping 19.3% CAGR between 2020 and 2030 to grow from a value of $65.9 billion in 2021 to a final value of $273.8 billion in 2030.

(NYSE:MP) shared the future trends in the rare earth metals industry during the firm's fourth quarter of 2022 analyst call where they shared:\n\nThis is one of the reasons we are so confident in the long-term growth trajectory of our business given the forecast of NdPr demand over the next decade or so are three times today\u2019s output. The challenge of the world producing enough rare earths to keep up with this demand is clearly a favorable indicator for NdPr pricing over time. I note that some of the positive leverage we saw in concentrate realized prices as NdPr prices went higher in recent quarters ended up going in the opposite direction as prices decline. This is in part driven by the variability and the implied discount we have to take in selling an intermediate feedstock to refiners overseas. While this effect will be moved once we are selling our own separated products, it\u2019s important to note that the realized price growth or decline in our concentrate sales over the course of this year as always, will outperform as NdPr market prices rise and generally under-perform as they decline.\n\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at some small-cap mining stocks that aren't finding much love from hedge funds.

We have had a mixed earnings season. While the future looks promising, there is still a lot of uncertainty due to the recent interest rate hike and looming recession concerns.\n\nHowever, we try to look for companies that look promising in 2023 and are ready to spur a new phase of growth. Watch out for these stocks to ensure that you make the most of the gains they post when the market improves. Having reported strong quarterly results, these are three stocks to buy before they soar to new heights this year.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere are several reasons I think Visa (NYSE:V) is one of the best stocks and could be a long-term winner. The company already has a tremendous history of success and has produced exceptional results in the last five years. I believe Visa is at a stage where it can take risks and hit record revenues. The company has seen a massive net income margin going from 36% in 2017 to 51% in 2022. More importantly, its total payment volume went from $10.2 trillion in 2017 to $14.1 trillion in 2022. V stock is trading at $225.98 today and is up 8.97% year-to-date.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe company recently reported better-than-expected quarterly results. It earned $2.09 a share and hit a revenue of $7.98 billion. Visa has seen an increase in digital payments and the post-pandemic rise in travel has led to solid earnings and sales growth. Its payment volume grew 10% year-over-year and services revenue grew 7% year-over-year. Considering the volatility of banks today, consumers see Visa as a very secure alternative. It has a dividend yield of 0.80% and the current dividend is $0.40. It ended the March quarter with $13.8 billion in cash. Visa is spearheading the transition towards a cashless society. While it may take some time for many countries to go digital, there is a massive growth opportunity lying ahead.\n\nStory continues\n\nBarclay analyst Ramsey El-Assal has a price target of $272 for the stock with an Overweight rating. Further, Truist analyst Andrew Jeffrey has also raised the price target to $270 with a buy rating after the robust Q2. Looking at the company\u2019s fundamentals and valuation, it is ready to skyrocket in the near term. This is a world-class business you are getting at a fair valuation.\n\nApple (AAPL) An image of a building with the Apple logo on it, a pink sunset in the background\n\nSource: askarim / Shutterstock\n\nConsidering its past performance and growing market capitalization, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) could soon become one of the biggest tech stocks to own. Besides being a high dividend growth stock, it is also one stock that continues to perform, no matter the market condition. The company is constantly expanding with innovation and has reported healthy earnings in the past. One of the high growth stocks, AAPL is trading for $167 today and is up 33.89% year to date. Apple is one of the best stocks to buy before the company reports earnings on May 4.\n\nThe company has entered the financial service segment with the new high-yield savings account in partnership with Goldman Sachs. This project it has attracted $1 billion in deposits in just 4 days. AAPL stock pays a dividend of 92 cents and has enough cash flow to continue rewarding investors. It is a cash flow machine and generates impressive free cash flow each year. The company has recently opened two new stores in India and is shifting its focus there due to the massive middle-class segment. India is one of the most populous nations in the world and Apple already generates $6 billion in annual revenue in the country.\n\nThe company is expecting to grow annual sales t0 $20 billion and grab a larger market share by 2025 in India. Additionally, its services segment has shown impressive growth potential and I believe it will rake in big numbers this quarter as well. Apple\u2019s massive growth in the market is here to stay and the stock could hit big numbers this year.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) General Motors (GM) sign with blue and white logo and brick building in background\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nElectric cars are everywhere and we are constantly hearing about EV incentives. General Motors (NYSE:GM) may not be an EV leader, it sure is growing on the right track. The company has the advantage of owning some of the top brands and it is aggressively charging forward in the EV space. It may not be as big as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) yet but this doesn\u2019t mean the company isn\u2019t doing well. It is planning to transition from internal combustion engine vehicles to EVs through 2035. GM stock is trading at $32.48 today and is down 16.72% in the past six months. This is an ideal buying opportunity for one of the top soaring stocks.\n\nGM\u2019s solid financials make it one of the best stocks to buy. It reported an EPS of $2.21 and a revenue of $39.99 billion. The management raised adjusted earnings expectations to a range of $11 to $13 billion. To achieve its production goals, the company, with South Korea-based Samsung SDI plans to invest $3 billion to build a new battery cell manufacturing plant.\n\nGeneral Motors will see three models that qualify for the full $7,500 in credit and this will lead to a higher demand for GM EVs this year. It aims to produce 1 million vehicles by 2025 and this number might look ambitious but the company does have a lot laid out. It has a solid balance sheet to support this goal and $24 billion in cash on hand.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Photo: Reuters / Carlos Barria.\n\nApple (AAPL)\n\nAfter the bell in the US, Apple will report its second-quarter earnings with investors expecting year-over-year revenue growth to be similar to the first-quarter (Q1), as previously stated by the tech giant.\n\nIt said on its last earnings call that sales of Macs and iPads would probably fall by double digits as a result of the \u201cchallenging\u201d economic environment.\n\nAnalysts expect Apple to report revenue of $92.6bn (\u00a373.64bn) for the second-quarter, a 4.8% decline from the $97.3bn it brought in during the same quarter last year. That's about in line with the 5% decline Apple posted in Q1.\n\nRead more: Apple could make or break Big Tech's earnings season\n\nHowever, recent big tech earnings have so far managed to beat expectations. For example,\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Meta (META) all largely outperformed analysts\u2019 estimates, despite pull backs in consumer and corporate spending.\n\n\u201cNone of what's already been reported matters come Thursday night,\u201d explained Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster.\n\n\u201cAnd the reason is ... because [of] the size of Apple, and also it's been relatively stable too. It's done a better job of enduring this versus other tech, so if there is a problem, you can throw out all the good news from Microsoft and Google and Meta,\u201d Munster added.\n\nShell (SHEL.L)\n\nShares in Shell were up nearly 2% at the time of writing in morning London trade after the energy giant reported a positive financial update.\n\nIt posted first-quarter adjusted earnings of $9.65bn, which beat analysts\u2019 expectations for $8.14bn. It was also higher than its profit in the first-quarter of 2022 ($9.13bn), when Russia first invaded Ukraine.\n\nMoreover, the oil giant kept its share buyback programme unchanged at $4bn over the next three months.\n\nRead more: Shell makes nearly \u00a31.4bn more than expected in opening quarter\n\nVictoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor, said: \u201cStrong trading amid the volatile price environment in Europe and America helped Shell\u2019s earnings outpace analysts\u2019 expectations and offset the impact of weaker oil and gas prices and lower refining margins. Its chemicals result also improved, driven by better margins thanks to lower utility and feedstock costs.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cUnlike BP, Shell maintained its share buyback programme, returning further cash to shareholders. Over the past year though, shares in Shell are up around 7.5%, underperforming BP which is up nearly 18%,\u201d she added.\n\nPacWest (PACW)\n\nShares in US mid-sized lender PacWest plunged more than 50% on Wednesday after traders digested media reports of a potential sale.\n\nPacWest has since confirmed that it has been approached by partners and investors \u2013 and also noted that it is considering selling strategic assets.\n\nThe group also sought to reassure investors by saying it had not suffered out-of-the-ordinary deposit outflows, unlike rival First Republic Bank which saw depositors withdraw $100bn.\n\nRead more: FTSE and European stocks open lower ahead of ECB rate decision\n\n\u201cLess than two months ago, PacWest received a $1.4bn cash injection from Atlas SP Partners following the collapse of SVB, which sparked negative reverberations across the sector,\u201d Victoria Scholar highlighted.\n\nFurthermore, she noted how First Republic Bank was rescued by JPMorgan with the Wall Street lender\u2019s CEO Jamie Dimon saying this week that \u2018there may be another smaller one\u2019 ahead, referring to a risk of another potential banking collapse.\n\n\u201cPacWest is the latest lender to fall victim to the turmoil in the US mid-cap banking sector with worried investors either cutting their holdings or adding to short positions which has punished its share price. PacWest has a heavy focus on commercial real estate lending, which has suffered on the back of the Fed\u2019s aggressive rate hiking path after the longstanding punchbowl of cheap money was removed,\u201d she added.\n\nPacWest stock has tumbled from a 52-week high of $34.68 to a low of $6.42 at yesterday\u2019s close.\n\nNext (NXT.L)\n\nShares in fashion retailer Next rose 2.06% on Thursday morning on the FTSE 100 after traders were encouraged by its latest trading update.\n\nThe company maintained its guidance for annual profit after reporting a smaller decline in first-quarter sales of 0.7%, rather than the 2% fall it had expected, in the 13 weeks to 29 April.\n\nThe fashion retailer expects full year pre-tax profit to be \u00a3795m and earnings per share of 501.9p.\n\n\u201cWhile Next\u2019s latest sales update was moderately ahead of its prior expectations, it is nothing to get excited about. Sales growth has stalled and the only area where it is making decent gains is from the income attached to customer credit accounts,\u201d Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said.\n\nMould also noted that Next has a serious growth problem and said that while it may remain a profitable business, a company of its calibre is expected to show financial progression year after year.\n\n\u201cRepeated guidance for an 8.7% decline in full-year pre-tax profit suggests the business needs to pull a rabbit out of the hat to regain its mojo,\u201d he added.\n\nWatch: Apple Earnings: Here\u2019s what to expect from the call</p>\\n<p>Investors will be listening for the company\u2019s revenue growth on the call, among other topics including iPhone and PC demand.</p>\\n<p>Yahoo Finance\u2019s <a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:1;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://www.yahoo.com/author/bradley-smith/\\\">Brad Smith</a> breaks down the three things he\u2019ll be watching on the call.</p>\\n<p>Make sure you tune into Yahoo Finance's live coverage ahead of Apple\u2019s (<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:2;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/?fr=sycsrp_catchall\\\">APPL</a>) earnings call Thursday.</p>\\n<p>Yahoo Finance Live Programming on Thursday:</p>\\n<p>- <a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:3;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgo1E9-w8Hw\\\">9:00 am ET</a>: <a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:4;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://www.yahoo.com/author/julie-hyman\\\">Julie Hyman</a>, <a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:5;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://www.yahoo.com/author/bradley-smith/\\\">Brad Smith</a> will outline what they want to hear from Apple\u2019s earnings call.</p>\\n<p>- <a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:6;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgo1E9-w8Hw\\\">11:00 am ET:</a> <a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:7;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://www.yahoo.com/author/rachelle-akuffo\\\">Rachelle Akuffo</a> will discuss how iPhone demand will come into play on the earnings call.</p>\\n<p>- <a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:8;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGiH-QRa4iU\\\">4:00 pm ET:</a> <a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:9;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://www.yahoo.com/author/seana-smith/\\\">Seana Smith </a> and <a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:10;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://www.yahoo.com/author/akiko-fujita/?.tsrc=fin-srch\\\">Akiko Fujita</a> will bring Apple\u2019s earnings to you live.</p>\\n<p>- <a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:11;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JEUI335SfE\\\">6:00 pm ET:</a> (or when the earnings call ends): <a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:12;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://www.yahoo.com/author/bradley-smith/\\\">Brad Smith</a> and <a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:13;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://www.yahoo.com/author/julie-hyman\\\">Julie Hyman</a> will have a vibe check with market reaction and a look ahead at what Apple\u2019s results mean for both consumers and investors.\",\"thumbnailUrl\":\"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/BeEDlaFrxjlklb4o.tA46g--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-05/cd99f160-e9f9-11ed-bfdf-bc9f874a8800\",\"uploadDate\":\"2023-05-03T21:37:20Z\",\"duration\":\"PT1M29S\",\"contentUrl\":\"https://video.media.yql.yahoo.com/v1/video/sapi/hlsstreams/4b8bc7d7-893d-3797-871b-a53945826d4e.m3u8?site=finance&region=GB&lang=en-GB&devtype=desktop&src=sapi\",\"embedUrl\":\"https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/video/apple-earnings-expect-call-213720496.html?format=embed\",\"identifier\":\"4b8bc7d7-893d-3797-871b-a53945826d4e\"}\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.", "link": "https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/trending-tickers-apple-shell-pacwest-next-112525437.html", "symbols": ["AAPL.MX", "AAPL.US", "AAPL34.SA", "ABEA.F", "ABEA.XETRA", "ABEC.F", "ABEC.XETRA", "AMZ.F", "AMZ.XETRA", "AMZN.MX", "AMZN.US", "AMZO34.SA", "APC.F", "APC.XETRA", "F8B.F", "FB2A.F", "FB2A.XETRA", "GOGL34.SA", "GOGL35.SA", "GOOG.MI"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.989, "neg": 0.047, "neu": 0.867, "pos": 0.086}}, {"date": "2023-05-04T10:45:48+00:00", "title": "10 Best Small-Cap Value Stocks to Invest In", "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the ten best small-cap value stocks to invest in. For more stocks, head on over to 5 Best Small-Cap Value Stocks to Invest In.\n\nInvesting in the stock market appears to be an easy task on the surface. After all, all that you have to do is to buy shares right? Well, it is this easy if one were to randomly buy stock and hope that the price increases. However, investing after conducting research is slightly trickier. There are thousands of stocks to choose from, and they are divided into categories based on their fundamentals and market statistics.\n\nTwo of these metrics are market capitalization and value. The former is relatively easy to comprehend. A market capitalization is simply the total worth of a firm's shares on the stock market. Stocks are divided into five categories by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) - a self regulator of brokerages. These are micro cap, small cap, mid cap, large cap, and mega cap. Delving a bit deeper into the details, a micro-cap stock is one whose market capitalization is less than $250 million, while mega-cap stocks, such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), are those with a market capitalization exceeding $200 billion.\n\nAnother category, small cap, is of firms whose capitalization ranges between $250 million and $2 billion. While on the surface these stocks naturally are not as appealing as for instance, Apple, investing in them has its own set of benefits. Companies like Apple and other technology behemoths are here today because while they too were once small caps, strong business models and lucrative market growth have funneled investor funds into them. Yet, their size often makes outsized or large returns difficult unless the market as a whole is recovering. As an illustration, consider the fact that Apple's shares have returned 7% over the past twelve months while year to date the stock is up 35% after it whipsawed last year in a tumultuous environment for the technology industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the small-cap front, while historically these stocks have provided a small premium over the stock market, the returns have not been consistent and have see-sawed. Research from Of Dollars and Data shows that since 1926, the U.S. stock market has delivered 7% in annual returns on average while small-cap stocks have offered a 1.4% premium by delivering an 8.4% return. Yet, since these percentage figures are for average returns, they smooth out the peaks and the troughs. A deeper analysis of the data shows that some periods saw them outperform the market by almost 13% while others saw them lag behind by as much as 7%. Additionally, the risk for these stocks, i.e. the standard deviation, was higher than the market as a whole since it stood at 32% compared to the 21% for the broader market.\n\nBuilding on this, one of the more popular U.S. small-cap market indexes, the Russel 2000 is 12.9% over the past five years and 216% since 2004. At the same time, the S&P 500 is up 56.5% over the past five years and 276% since 2004. This confirms the volatility of small-cap returns shared above, as while the S&P has widely outperformed the Russel 2000 over a shorter time horizon, over the long term, the returns almost seem to converge. For an additional data point, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 40.54% over the past five years and by more than 300% since 2004.\n\nShifting our focus to value stocks, these are stocks typically thought of as ones that have failed to capture market attention and are sold cheaper compared to the earnings that they bring to the income statement. The billionaire founder of\u00a0 Fisher Investments Mr. Ken Fisher has some timeless insights about these stocks and what to look for and what to avoid when investing in them:\n\nSince well before I was born, people regularly ponder what's a better investment? Growth stocks, or value stocks? Now some of this about the stocks, and some of this is about you, or the person that would entertain the question. Simply, in the very long term, growths and value do the same, really similarly. By that I mean the very long term. Neither one is particularly better, because in the long term shifts in supply of equity of any category including growth and value will overwhelm any shifts in demand for the category. In my Only Three Questions book, I wrote basically a whole chapter on that topic. How supply overwhelms demand for any category including growth and value.\n\nBut in the shorter term, one of them leads, one of them lags almost always. And that goes on for a long time, often people come to think that that category's going to be permanently better. It won't. Often, as in recently this year [2021] lot of people say 'ah, this category is due because it's been under performing for a long tine.' That's never, ever true, these kinds of\u00a0 things. Categories of stocks don't move from under performing to outperforming because they're due, market's don't do, 'they're due'. What markets do is shift when fundamental forces that are not pre priced into the market make one of them favored.\n\nThe thing that really drives value, which has been lagging now for quite a long time other than short term irregulars first. The thing that really drives value is after a long bear market, where the spread between short and long term rates has been flattened or inverted, where short rates are above long rates, which causes banks not to lend to lower quality, the perception of lower quality value stocks, and they get financing starved and they plunge from that over a rugged long period. And then the yield curve goes the other way, long rates go above the short rates, and the banks start lending more aggressively with a time lag. It's that tie lag from the yield curve getting steeper that drives value stocks doing better than growth.\n\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at some small-cap value stocks being favored by hedge funds. Some top picks are Warrior Met Coal, Inc. (NYSE:HCC), SandRidge Energy, Inc. (NYSE:SD), and Gray Television, Inc. (NYSE:GTN). 10 Best Small Cap Value Stocks to Invest In\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of the best small-cap value stocks, we first listed all stocks with a price to earnings ratio lower than five and a market capitalization between $300 million and $2 billion.

For more stocks, head on over to 5 Best Small-Cap Growth Stocks to Buy Now.\n\nEvery day, countless stocks see their values rise and fall on the market. Data from the World Federation of Exchanges shows that as of Q1 2022, a whopping 58,200 companies were listed on all of the world's stock exchanges. This figure has only grown, with the latest data from the same body showing that as of April 2023, the total number of publicly traded firms stood at 58,301. These firms had a combined market value of $105 trillion with $9.8 trillion of shares being traded. Most of the listed companies were in the Asia Pacific region, which accounted for 55.2% or 32,171 of the total listed shares. Naturally, this also led to most of the trades being carried out in these markets as well, with 2.3 billion trades carried out in the region out of the total 3.3 billion trades.\n\nWithin these thousands of companies, there are several ways to classify the firms. One of these comes from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), which is a private American regulator of brokerages. The FINRA categorizes stocks along micro cap, small cap, mid cap, large cap, and mega cap - with mega-cap stocks defined as those that have a market capitalization greater than $200 billion, while small caps have a market capitalization that ranges between $250 million and $2 billion.\n\nOut of these, small caps often catch attention in the media, since their relatively stable business models combined with low share prices provide both a chance at share price growth and attractive entry points. But as is with the case with most aspects of the financial world, intuitive explanations often fail to hold their ground against research. On this front, research from Northwestern University shows that while small-cap stocks do offer the potential for high returns, they also carry higher risk when compared to large and mega cap stocks. Building on this, researchers from Brazil took an interesting look at small caps, as they investigated whether a crossover moving average trading strategy employed through portfolios of large cap and small-cap stocks would yield any differences in profitability. The researchers found that large cap stocks do not offer any significant benefits in terms of profitability, a conclusion that is generally thought counterintuitive in emerging markets due to high levels of liquidity.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoving back to America, and looking at what's going on in the small-cap market right now, investment firm Royce Investment Partners which is known for its focus on small-cap stocks has some data for how the market performed during the first quarter of this year. It shows that small-cap stocks gained 13.7% year to date until the start of February when interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve and growing rhetoric for a recession pushed them down. This led the Russell 2000 index to drop from posting almost 15% in returns by the start of this year to 2.7% as the first quarter ended. Royce adds that volatility was a key characteristic of the small-cap sector over the past couple of quarters, with returns swinging from +10% to -10% regularly. Additionally, turbulence in the economy also led investors to flee to the relatively safer mega cap firms such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nAnother report from Janus Henderson is quite optimistic for the fortunes of small-cap companies. Janus outlines that when the price to book value of a firm is used as a proxy to evaluate a stock's discount, small caps have traded significantly below the average most of the time since 1995. It also shares that small caps actually peaked large caps after the collapse of the infamous dot com bubble until the summer of 2018, with the large caps then taking the edge as they were aided by the mega cap companies. Janus adds that small caps tend to perform poorly in the buildup to a recession. But as a recession takes hold, the small caps are \"resilient\" and cary the potential to deliver strong results after the downturn is over. Finally, the firm concludes by stressing that portfolio positioning is key to benefiting from the potential of long term outsized financial performance.\n\nThis sentiment is also echoed by Chuck Royce, the portfolio manager for Royce Investment Partners, who shared his outlook on the small-cap sector in April 2023 and when asked whether the valuations for small-cap stocks have become attractive, replied:\n\nYes, the Russell 2000 was still in a bear market at the end of March. It fell -24.7% from its peak on 11/8/21 through 3/31/23, and the average stock in the Russell 2000 was down -35.2% from their respective 52-week highs through the end of March. This has created opportunities for us to add to our highest conviction names as well as the chance to investigate new names in several areas. The troubles for regional banks rippled to hit many value and cyclical stocks hard. But our long-term investment perspective and emphasis on quality allow us to tune out the short-term noise, which is especially important at times like this. Within Financials, for example, we like insurance companies, business development companies, and alternative asset managers. These are long-term investments in companies that are not reliant on the banking system. And we\u2019re also looking closely at select regional banks to see which companies look best positioned to survive the currently difficult conditions for the industry.\n\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at some best small-cap growth stocks to buy now, out of which the top picks are Akero Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:AKRO), SomaLogic, Inc. (NASDAQ:SLGC), and Mirion Technologies, Inc.

Second-quarter results due after Thursday\u2019s close are expected to show a 4.8% drop in revenue and a 5.8% slide in earnings, according to consensus analyst estimates, paving the way for a first year of declining sales since 2019.\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t as though the business is going downhill, but it is very highly valued, especially since we no longer have the perfect backdrop for tech,\u201d said Daniel O\u2019Keefe, who manages about $36 billion as a portfolio manager at Artisan Partners. \u201cApple has to grow a lot to generate good returns from here, and there\u2019s no reason to think the growth it has seen over the past several years will continue at that pace.\u201d\n\nCompared with the stellar results from the likes of Microsoft and Meta, Apple\u2019s report is likely to make for more sobering reading. UBS Group AG analysts warned on Monday that US iPhone demand had \u201cnotably softened\u201d in March, while Bloomberg Intelligence expects the smartphone market to drop 4% this year, with weakness concentrated in the first half of 2023. A disappointing forecast from Qualcomm Inc. on Wednesday underlined concerns about smartphone demand.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, analysts have been trimming their expectations. Consensus estimates have fallen for full-year revenue and earnings since Apple\u2019s last report in February.\n\nStory continues\n\nNot that such concerns are evident in the stock\u2019s valuation. Apple trades at 26 times estimated earnings, well above its 10-year average of 18 and at a premium to both the Nasdaq 100 and the S&P 500 tech index. In a sign of how Wall Street is muted on the stock\u2019s outlook, the average analyst price target suggests a return potential of just 4.6% over the next 12 months, the lowest among the market\u2019s trillion-dollar companies.\n\n\u201cThe risks are high, the stock is highly valued, if not overvalued, and the outlook doesn\u2019t seem to be all that great,\u201d said Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth Management.\n\nApple\u2019s rally partly reflects how investors have turned to big tech amid turmoil in the banking sector, and JPMorgan Chase & Co. analyst Samik Chatterjee says the stock is likely to retain its safe-haven status, so long as its results don\u2019t show a material deterioration in fundamentals.\n\nThe gain also reflects optimism that the Federal Reserve could be nearing the end of its rate-hike cycle, easing what was a major headwind to tech multiples in last year\u2019s selloff. On Wednesday, the Fed raised interest rates by a quarter percentage point but hinted this may be the final move of the cycle.\n\n\u201cLarge cap US stocks are pricing in a soft landing, and better-than-expected earnings do speak to the possibility of that outcome,\u201d said Som Priestley, multi-asset solutions strategist at T. Rowe Price. \u201cHowever, upside might be muted given where multiples are.\u201d\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nAnalysts are raising earnings per share estimates for the Nasdaq 100 Index after cutting their expectations through 2022 in a sign that confidence is starting to return. The increase in forecasts provides some backing for this year\u2019s 19% rally in the tech-heavy gauge.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nMicrosoft Corp. is getting rid of the waitlist to try its new OpenAI-based Bing search and chat, and adding features like the ability to request and post images in an effort to sustain its renewed momentum in the market. Qualcomm Inc., the largest maker of smartphone processors, tumbled in premarket trading after a disappointing forecast signaled that demand for mobile devices remains sluggish \u2014 especially in China. Sales of smartwatches, including Apple\u2019s top selling version, have plateaued and are no longer a significant threat to the pricier end of the Swiss watch industry, according to Morgan Stanley. Silicon Valley has taken investment from moneyed state-run funds in the Middle East for years. Now that the technology industry is mired in a downturn, those relationships are becoming more desirable, and more visible.

Luxshare has won orders to make three of the four iPhone 15 models for the California-based tech giant, including the entry-level version and premium models like the iPhone 15 Plus, according to the report, citing sources close to the suppliers.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nApple is reportedly launching four models this year, including the iPhone 15, 15 Plus, 15 Pro and its priciest model - the 15 Pro Max or Ultra - which will be exclusively assembled by Foxconn.\n\nIt is the first time that Luxshare, which started out making cables for Apple and only began iPhone production in 2020 after it acquired two Chinese plants owned by Taiwan's Wistron, has been awarded manufacturing orders for three upcoming iPhone models in a given year. The move signals the mainland manufacturer's rising clout in Apple's China-based supply chain.\n\nPegatron, another mainstream Taiwanese manufacturer for Apple, which was the main supplier of the iPhone 14 Plus, will be responsible for a portion of the iPhone 15 Plus and 15 Pro models, the report added.\n\nStory continues\n\nFoxconn and Luxshare did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Pegatron declined to comment.\n\nEddie Han, senior analyst at Taiwan-based consultancy Isaiah Research, said Pegatron may receive 20 to 25 per cent of orders for the iPhone 15 Pro, while Luxshare may win 20 to 30 per cent of iPhone 15 Pro Max production.\n\nThe arrangement marks the first time Apple has tapped three suppliers to produce its premium iPhone models, highlighting its efforts to mitigate potential supply chain disruptions by having backup suppliers. Analysts say the move could help other suppliers, including Luxshare, further erode Foxconn's share of the Apple value chain.\n\nHan said Apple may have introduced a new rule for its supply chain to ensure that components and parts are provided by at least two suppliers to avoid potential risks associated with dependence on a single supplier.\n\nLast November, a worker exodus triggered by China's stringent Covid controls and complaints over stipends upended Foxconn Zhengzhou, the world's largest iPhone factory, leading to shipment delays for the iPhone 14 and subsequently moves by Apple to lessen its manufacturing dependence on China.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook (right) visits the Kunshan plant of Luxshare on December 4, 2017.

Something I don\u2019t often see mentioned about Apple is the strong seasonal tendencies of its revenues.\n\nIn the quarterly revenues chart below we see revenues regularly explode higher following the holiday season and are then mostly stagnant through the rest of the year. But Q1 2023 sales were below Q1 2022, which shows that there was a YoY slowdown in the most recent holiday season.\n\nAdditionally, analyst earnings revisions have been mixed, which gives Apple a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). Q2 expectations are looking down a bit, which lines up with market expectations of a broader economic slowdown in the second half of the year.\n\nAlso concerning, last quarter Apple posted a rare sales and earnings miss. Last quarter marked Apple\u2019s first earnings miss since 2016, which was just -$0.01 below expectations and its second sales miss since 2016, which was also just below expectations.\n\nAnalysts are expecting earnings growth to decline -5.3% YoY to $1.44 a share. The rest of the year is expected to be mostly flat as well, however next year\u2019s earnings are projected to pick up significantly.\n\nStory continues\n\nBear Case\n\nShorting Apple is almost never advised, and although I don\u2019t consider this my base case it is important to address the primary risks. AAPL stock has acted as an incredible haven this year and its returns make up 25% of S&P 500\u2019s total returns YTD.\n\nAt this point investors are treating Apple stock like a Treasury bond, and it has considerably outperformed Treasuries. But is that realistic? Will some doubt start creeping into investors\u2019 minds and cause Apple to roll over.\n\nApple\u2019s most critical profit center is the iPhone, which makes up 52% of total revenue. In the Q1 report, we saw that iPhone sales were down YoY. Management chalked this up to a one-time event and blamed the miss on supply issues related to the lockdowns in China.\n\nWhat if it was a demand issue though? What if we are moving past peak iPhone? The chart below shows total annual smartphone sales, which have clearly peaked. This means that Apple is already fighting an uphill battle.\n\nFurthermore, iPhone quality and longevity is improving, and so are prices, and the length of payment plans. I know personally, the iPhone 11 Pro I bought in 2019 still feels as good as new.\n\nMarket share is another important consideration. Apple currently has an impressive 23% market share of global smartphones. How much room does Apple have to continue to grow this figure?\n\nThe massive Chinese middle class is a very important segment for Apple to target, but what if they start to prefer the Chinese branded phones? Oppo and Xiaomi have made some extremely compelling new phones, particularly their smart flip phones. Flip phones are extremely interesting because they begin to blend phone and tablet products. Flip phones are a product Apple doesn\u2019t have and I haven\u2019t heard rumors of anything in the pipeline.\n\nThe black swan event would be a military conflict between the US and China. In this worst case scenario, it would be highly unlikely that the civil relations between Apple and China continue.\n\nThe concerns listed are more hypotheticals and questions. Of course, Apple has defied all investor logic for over a decade now, and its downfall is an extremely unlikely event. But doubt and fear can move a stock. Is the next 20% move in Apple stock higher or lower? I don\u2019t know, but there are certainly catalysts the give potential to the -20% possibility.\n\nTechnicals\n\nThere isn\u2019t a clean chart pattern to trade AAPL from, but this large range looks significant to me. The $180 level is resistance and $130 support. Right now, price is in no-mans land in the middle of this large range.\n\nIf price can clear the $180 level, resistance should turn into support, and the next multi-year leg higher in Apple should commence. However, a rejection at $180 would be very significant. If the stock can\u2019t clear that level, it may be indicative of not just Apple, but the market more broadly.\n\nWith a recession likely coming later this year, it is possible we will see Apple retest the high of the range, and then as the recession takes hold, swing back down to the bottom of the range. Rather than trying to short the stock, investors would be better off waiting for price to come back down to the $130-$140 buy zone.\n\nValuation\n\nApple is currently trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 28x, which is above the market average and above its five-year median of 24x. This certainly isn\u2019t a cheap valuation, but as one of the world\u2019s leading companies it isn\u2019t particularly expensive either. This reasonable valuation doesn\u2019t play well for the bears.\n\nBottom Line\n\nApple is a juggernaut in the stock market, and its supremacy is undeniable. While I did lay out a bear case, it is more of an exercise in risk management than anything else. While the dynamics that have propelled Apple to this level over the past decade may change, the biggest risk currently is an economic slowdown.\n\nApple brought luxury to the masses, so if the average person begins to feel the heat of a slowing economy, they probably won\u2019t be buying a new iPhone. But there is a path where the recession is not too bad, and in that case, Apple continues to chug along as the world\u2019s leading stock.\n\nWhy Haven\u2019t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +6.2 average gain per year.

Meanwhile, Apple is forecast to unveil billions of dollars in fresh share buybacks and Shell becomes the latest oil major to post better-than-expected quarterly results.\n\n1. The end of an era for the Fed?\n\n\"There is a sense that we're much closer to the end of this than to the beginning.\"\n\nSo said Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell in a news conference after the U.S. central bank's Federal Open Market Committee unanimously decided to lift interest rates by 25 basis points to above 5%.\n\nIt was the tenth-straight hike in borrowing costs for the Fed, but observers listening closely to Powell's comments on Wednesday discerned that policymakers may feel that a pause to this tightening cycle could soon be at hand. With economic growth showing signs of sputtering and a credit crunch threatening regional banks (see below), the impact of the Fed's campaign of rate rises aimed at corralling runaway inflation is starting to be felt.\n\nEchoing that sentiment, the FOMC's guidance was revised to say that new data and the overall effect of elevated rates would play a role in determining if additional increases are needed. Tellingly, Powell called this a \"meaningful\" change in its outlook. Time will tell if that means a pause is imminent.\n\n2. PacWest weighs its options\n\nThe malaise in midsize U.S. lenders intensified on Wednesday, with Beverly Hills-based PacWest Bancorp (NASDAQ:PACW) becoming the latest bank to teeter on the edge of possible collapse.\n\nIn a statement, PacWest said it has been approached by \"several potential partners and investors\" in a bid to secure a financial lifeline, adding that these discussions are ongoing.\n\nThe comments came after shares in the bank dropped by more than 50% in after-hours trading following a Bloomberg report that it was reviewing its strategic options, including a potential sale. Citing people familiar with the situation, Bloomberg said that PacWest is working with a financial advisor to also explore a potential breakup or capital raise.\n\nStory continues\n\nPacWest's issues all but quash nascent hopes that the emergency acquisition of ailing First Republic earlier this week by JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) would stem the most urgent crisis in the U.S. banking industry since 2008.\n\n3. Futures muted ahead of Apple earnings\n\nU.S. stock futures were subdued on Thursday, as investors digested the Fed decision and eyed the turmoil in regional banks.\n\nAt 05:12 ET (09:12 GMT), the Dow futures contract was up 13 points or 0.04%, S&P 500 futures were largely unchanged, and Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 40 points or 0.31%.\n\nWaiting in the wings after U.S. markets close are earnings from technology giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). The California-based company is expected to report a drop in sales for the second quarter in a row, with analysts projecting about a 5% dip in revenue due to weaker demand for its Mac and iPad products.\n\nBut these returns are not expected to keep the iPhone maker from unveiling a massive increase in its share buyback program. Reports suggest that analysts believe the repurchases, which are viewed as a proxy for the overall strength of the business, could be worth $90 billion.\n\n4. A beat for Shell\n\nRoyal Dutch Shell (LON:SHEL) posted better-than-expected income in the first quarter, as Europe's biggest oil and gas producer was boosted in part by strong fuel trading performance that helped offset easing energy prices.\n\nAdjusted profit in the first three months of the year jumped by 5.7% compared to the same period last year to $9.65 billion, topping Bloomberg consensus estimates of $8.14 billion. Its chemicals and refined products division had a bumper quarter, with profit surging by 52% year-on-year to $1.78 billion.\n\nShell's results mark the latest beat for the oil majors during this earnings season. Rivals BP (LON:BP) and Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) both delivered higher-than-projected returns thanks to resilient demand that has helped to limit the impact of a recent retreat in oil prices.\n\nSeparately, analysts largely welcomed Shell's decision to maintain its pace of share buybacks at $4 billion over the next three months. The repurchases have been a key pillar of chief executive Wael Sawan's drive to close the valuation gap between Shell and its U.S. peers.\n\n5. Decision day for the ECB\n\nThe European Central Bank is widely tipped to bump up interest rates at its latest governing council meeting on Thursday, but it remains to be seen if officials in Frankfurt will begin to back a gradual easing off on a recent monetary policy tightening cycle.\n\nInflation data out of the Eurozone this week has helped bolster the case for a more dovish approach from the ECB, which has made curbing price growth a top priority. Core prices - a key gauge of inflation for the central bank that strips out volatile food and energy prices - inched lower in April to 5.6%, although the reading remains well above the ECB's stated 2% target.\n\nMeanwhile, an ECB survey of lending data for March showed that banks were making it more difficult for borrowers to get their hands on credit.\n\nWith these developments in mind, analysts at ING predicted that the ECB will deliver \"at least\" two more hikes during its current rate-rise campaign: one by 25 basis points today, followed by a further additional increase at its next meeting in June.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFed rate hike, PacWest teeters, Apple ahead - what's moving markets\n\nPeloton forecasts better-than-expected revenue\n\nHF Sinclair beats Q1 profit estimates, submits buyout bid for Holly Energy", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fed-rate-hike-pacwest-teeters-054520534.html", "symbols": ["AAPL.MX", "AAPL.US", "AAPL34.SA", "APC.F", "JPM.US", "PACW.US", "XOM.US"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.996, "neg": 0.042, "neu": 0.85, "pos": 0.108}}, {"date": "2023-05-03T22:39:10+00:00", "title": "Time to Buy Apple Stock for More Upside as Earnings Approach?", "content": "Edging out some nice gains this year all eyes are on Apple (AAPL) this week with the company set to release its fiscal second-quarter earnings on Thursday, May 4.\n\nApple\u2019s performance has been strong outperforming most of its big tech peers such as Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), and Microsoft (MSFT) while easily topping the broader indexes.\n\nWith Apple stock now up +30% in 2023, investors are wondering if strong second-quarter results and positive guidance can help the computer and technology innovator divvy up more gains like it is historically known to do. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nQ2 Preview\n\nApple\u2019s second-quarter earnings are expected to dip -5% at $1.44 per share compared to EPS of $1.52 in Q2 2022. Sales are forecasted to be down -4% from the prior year quarter at $93.32 billion.\n\nStill, Apple\u2019s stock tends to pop after beating earnings expectations and investors are certainly hoping the company can do so. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWall Street will be monitoring Apple's guidance to see if operating conditions are stabilizing going forward.\n\nLast quarter, CEO Tim Cook stated a stronger dollar, production issues in China, and the broader challenges in the macroeconomic environment affected results. To that point, Apple most recently missed its first quarter top and bottom line expectations by a slight margin. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNotably, Q1 sales missed top-line estimates by -3% and declined -5% YoY which was the largest quarterly drop since 2016 and the first decline in quarterly revenue since 2019.\n\nWith Apple expected to post another quartely decline in sales, Wall Street will be seeing if the company's outlook indicates a stop to the bleeding. With that being said, the sentiment toward tech stocks is very positive as inflation begins to ease and the ability to offer positive guidance could extend Apple\u2019s rally.\n\nGrowth & Outlook\n\nAccording to Zacks estimates, Apple\u2019s sales are now forecasted to be down -1% this year but rebound and rise 7% in FY24 to $414.61 billion. More importantly, fiscal 2024 would be a 59% increase from 2019 pre-pandemic sales of $260.17 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the bottom line, earnings are projected to slightly decline by -1% in FY23 but jump 11% in FY24 at $6.66 per share. Fiscal 2024 would represent a very impressive 124% growth in EPS since the pandemic with 2019 earnings at $2.97 per share. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nPerformance & Valuation\n\nWith its growth story seemingly intact, investors may be more intrigued by the strong performance in Apple stock this year. To that point, Apple\u2019s stellar growth has led to the stock soaring +951% over the last decade.\n\nThis has crushed the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, while also topping the performance of Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft stocks. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTrading around $168 per share, Apple stock trades at 28X forward earnings which is nicely below its decade-long high of 38.6X but above the median of 16X.\n\nAlthough this is above the industry average of 9.1X and the S&P 500\u2019s 18.9X, Apple is the clear-cut leader in its space and Wall Street has historically been ok with paying a premium for AAPL shares due to the company\u2019s growth potential.\n\nPlus, when considering Apple\u2019s growth rate its PEG ratio of 2.1 is slightly below the industry average and not too far above the S&P 500\u2019s 1.72 although the optimum level is less than 1.0. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nApple stock currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) going into its fiscal second quarter report. Looking at Apple\u2019s historical performance and the expected growth next year there could still be a nice amount of upside from current levels.\n\nHowever, more upside in Apple stock will largely depend on the company\u2019s ability to offer positive or better-than-expected guidance and put an end to the decline in quarterly sales.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

To skip the detailed analysis and recent updates about the engineering industry, go directly to the 5 Best Engineering Stocks to Buy Now.\n\nEngineers have been in demand since ancient times. However, the most significant impact of the engineering services started in the 18th century. Engineering services are the backbone of technological growth which is one of the three main factors of Total Factor Productivity (TFP). The TFP has a correlation of 60% with economic progress in advanced countries.\n\nThe global engineering services market was worth $707 billion in 2022 and is expected to reach around $1.22 trillion in 2023, registering a CAGR of 5.9%. The market share of engineering services was largely captured by North America at 38%, which is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.6% during the forecasted period. On the other hand, the CAGR in East Asia is expected to be 6.5%.\n\nIn the United States, engineering services contributed to 3% of the jobs and accounted for 2.8% of the country\u2019s GDP in 2020. In addition, they were also responsible for $64.5 billion in taxes paid. According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment in architecture and engineering is expected to grow by 4% between 2021 and 2031 and their median annual income was $79,840 in May 2021, which was almost 75% more than the average median income of all occupations. The highest median income was recorded by petroleum engineers at $130,850 per year or $62.91 per hour and employment in the field is expected to grow by 8%. It was followed by computer hardware engineers with a median income of $128,170 per year or $61.62 per hour.\n\nOne of the major growth prospects of the engineering industry in the United States is The CHIPS and Science Act, an act that will provide $52.7 billion for American semiconductor research, development, manufacturing, and workforce development. The semiconductor industry is highly dependent on engineers as they are the ones who have to design, produce, and test the products. In light of the news, the semiconductor company Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) announced an additional $40 billion investment in memory chip manufacturing.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe CHIPS Act is also expected to benefit the industrial sector\u2019s engineering and construction industry as it will lead to huge construction projects of new semiconductor plants, research centers, and general infrastructure. The automotive industry which is dependent on mechanical and electrical engineering is also set to benefit from the act as semiconductors are essential for the growing demand of electric vehicles in the market.\n\nEngineering includes a very broad scope of sciences and has significant importance in the defense, construction, software, automotive, and energy sector, along with many others. In our article, hedge fund sentiment has been used as a primary criteria for stock selection but since the engineering sector covers many companies, we won\u2019t be able to discuss all of them. However, some of the important engineering stocks that have been discussed are Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). 10 Best Engineering Stocks to Buy Now\n\nPhoto by ThisisEngineering RAEng on Unsplash\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we chose the stocks which rely heavily on engineering to function. These stocks were picked based on the hedge fund sentiment of each stock and were listed accordingly. These are thus the best engineering stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\n\nThe hedge fund sentiment around each stock has been taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 943 elite hedge funds.\n\nBest Engineering Stocks to Buy Now\n\n10. Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 74\n\nMicron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) is an Idaho-based semiconductor manufacturing company that produces and sells data and memory devices for computers. The company is one of the best engineering stocks to buy now as it has won an Award for Data Engineering Transformation by Analytica India Magazine, 2023, and its DRAM and NAND flash memory chips are feats of engineering.\n\nIn Q4 2022, Connecticut-based Viking Global Investors increased its stake in Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) by 55% with nearly 836 million shares worth $417.7 million. In the same quarter, 74 hedge funds were bullish on the stock.\n\nOn April 13, New Street analyst Pierre Ferragu maintained a Buy rating on Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) stock and raised the price target to $100 from $70, citing recovery of \u201ccost of goods sold\u201d.

(NASDAQ:MU) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter. Here is what it said:\n\n\u201cInflation is still higher than interest rates\u2026 not an incentive to save for most people. Either inflation must come down or interest rates have to go up further. Or both. And probably both. Now that they are taking the punch bowl away and the party is over, what happens next? For whatever reason, the stock market seems to always precede the economic reality: Micron reached a high of $98.45 on January 5th, 2022 and is trading at $50.00 today.\u201d\n\n9. Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 75\n\nAnalog Devices, Inc.

(NASDAQ:ADI) grew profits nicely in 2022, bucking the overall semiconductor industry trend of a decline brought on by a drop in demand and excess inventory in the channels. Analog is one of the leaders in the analog semiconductor segment, where supply is much more constricted due to the shortage of engineering expertise and new capacity construction. Thus, the company often beats to a different drummer than the rest of the semiconductor industry.\u201d\n\n8. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 79\n\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is one of the oil Supermajors and it mainly requires petroleum engineers for its upstream business, mechanical engineers for midstream, and chemical engineers for its downstream business.\n\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) released its first-quarter earnings report on April 28 where it posted record first-quarter earnings of $11.4 billion. In addition, the company increased the net production of oil and gas by 300,000 barrels of oil equivalent compared to the first quarter of 2022.\n\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) has recently been working on making the company greener. In its latest quarter, the company announced its long-term commercial agreement with Linde plc (NYSE:LIN) for carbon capture and storage. According to the agreement, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) will capture, transport, and store up to 2.2 million metric tons of CO2 from the company.\n\nHere\u2019s what First Eagle Investments said about Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:\n\n\u201cIntegrated oil and gas giant Exxon Mobil performed well in the second quarter as continued high prices for energy products supported the stock. As the largest refiner in the US, the company has benefitted from wide \u201ccrack spreads,\u201d or the margin between the cost of crude oil and the petroleum products extracted from it. Exxon continues to invest in refining capacity in the US, which industrywide has been in steady decline since 2019. We are pleased that Exxon has been using its strong cash flows to reduce debt and to return cash to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases.\u201d\n\n7. General Motors Company (NYSE:GM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 80\n\nGeneral Motors Company (NYSE:GM) is a Michigan-based automotive company, and it is one of the biggest automobile companies in the US by sales. The company's engineering marvels include its industry-famous EV batteries, Ultium Drive, and wireless battery management system.\n\nOn May 1, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas raised the price target on General Motors Company (NYSE:GM)\u2019s shares to $38 from $35 and updated the rating on the stock to Overweight from Equal Weight. Bumping up the stock to the \u201ctop 5\u201d position for his U.S. automotive coverage, the analyst highlighted the company\u2019s \u201ccapital discipline\u201d and free cash flows.\n\nGeneral Motors Company (NYSE:GM) is a dividend-paying stock with a dividend yield of 1.09% at the time of writing. A quarterly dividend of $0.09 was declared by the company on April 24, payable by June 15 to the shareholders of record on June 2.\n\nDiamond Hill Capital mentioned General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter. Here is what it said:\n\n\u201cMost recently, we initiated a position in General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), one of the largest automakers in the United States. Over the past several years, GM has taken steps necessary to focus the company on the most profitable segments and move into position to compete in an electrified and autonomous world. With the recent rise in interest rates there was a meaningful selloff in the auto industry, which presented us an attractive entry point to a name we know well.\u201d\n\n6. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 91\n\nTesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is an American automotive company. As an electric vehicle manufacturer, the company\u2019s demand for engineers comes from the mechanical, production, and electrical engineering fields. This year has particularly been better than the last year for Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). The stock was down almost 65% between the end of December 2021 and 2022 and in 2023, the stock is up by around 50% year to date at the time of writing.\n\nCathie Wood\u2019s Ark Invest is quite bullish on Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) and has been buying its shares since\u200c January 2023. Wood believes that the company\u2019s valuation will cross over $6 trillion in the next 4 years.\n\nTesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is in the same league as other leaders of the engineering industry like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nAristotle Atlantic Partners, LLC made the following comment about Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cTesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) was a negative contributor to performance due to our underweight position relative to Russell 1000 Growth Index, as the company had strong performance in Q1. The strength occurred after the company partially reversed a previously announced price cut for its electric vehicles following a period of strong demand. Tesla also reported better-than-expected results for Q4 2022 during the first quarter.\n\nTesla Motors designs, develops, manufactures, and markets high-performance, technologically advanced electric cars and solar energy generation and energy storage products. Tesla sells more than five fully electric cars, among others, the Model X and Y SUVs, as well as the Model S sedan and Model 3 sedan. The company has a growing global network of Tesla Superchargers, which are industrial grade, high-speed vehicle chargers, typically placed along well-traveled routes and in and around dense city centers to allow Tesla owners quick and reliable charging. Tesla offers certain advanced driver assist systems under its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving options. US customers generate nearly half of Tesla\u2019s sales.\n\nWe see Tesla as the leading manufacturer of battery powered electric vehicles (EVs). The company has achieved scaled production of EVs before the other large automobile manufacturers. The company\u2019s technology in battery production and self-driving technology is more mature than competitors\u2019 offerings. EVs are one of the fastest growing categories within automobile manufacturing. The profit margin in the automotive segment is significantly above automotive competitors which provides the company flexibility to price its vehicles more strategically as the competition eventually scales up their EV production. The direct-to-consumer sales model gives the company more control over its relationship with its customers as well as a source of higher profit margin since there is no dealership share of the profits.\u201d\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 Best Engineering Stocks to Buy Now.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n30 Most Expensive Cities to Live in the U.S. 16 Biggest Offshore Oil Rig Companies in the U.S. 25 Best Cities for Singles in the U.S.\n\nDisclosure.

That sent the shares down as much as 7.5% to $104.35.\n\nThe outlook shows the challenge Qualcomm faces in navigating an industrywide downturn. Weak demand for phones has led to a buildup in handset chips \u2014 the company\u2019s main source of revenue. Chief Executive Officer Cristiano Amon has promised investors that once phone makers have worked through their inventory, the orders will bounce back. But that\u2019s taking longer than feared.\n\nThe company now expects the total market for phones to shrink by a percentage range in the high single digits in 2023. Inventory reductions by customers will likely continue for two more quarters, Qualcomm projected. Demand in China hasn\u2019t returned to the levels that Qualcomm and others had expected, Amon said.\n\n\u201cCommon sense and the overall expectation was that the China market was going to bounce back,\u201d he said on a conference call with analysts. \u201cWe\u2019ve not seen those signs yet.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s main product is the processor that runs many of the world\u2019s best-known phones. It also sells the modem chips that connect Apple Inc.\u2019s iPhone to high-speed data networks. An additional chunk of Qualcomm\u2019s profit comes from licensing the fundamental technology that underpins all modern mobile networks \u2014 fees that phone makers pay whether they use Qualcomm-branded chips or not.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company\u2019s \u201cmodem-only\u201d customer, which is how Qualcomm refers to Apple, is ordering fewer parts after stocking up earlier in the year, Chief Financial Officer Akash Palkhiwala said on the conference call. But he said that observation wasn\u2019t a comment about demand for the iPhone. Investors will get a better sense of how that device is doing when Apple reports its own earnings Thursday.\n\nIn the longer run, San Diego-based Qualcomm is looking to decrease its reliance on smartphones by selling more chips for cars, networking, computing and wearable devices. The company is considering acquisitions that would accelerate that diversification, Amon said.\n\nQualcomm gets a large portion of its sales from Chinese manufacturers that serve domestic customers \u2014 the world\u2019s biggest buyers of chips. Pandemic lockdowns in that country restrained consumer spending, and Qualcomm said there\u2019s been no quick rebound yet.\n\nBefore the earnings report, Qualcomm\u2019s stock had increased 2.6% this year through the close, trailing broader gains by semiconductor-related shares.\n\nThe company also projected third-quarter profit before certain items of $1.20 to $1.70 a share. That compares with an average projection of $2.20.\n\nIn the fiscal second quarter, which ended March 26, revenue fell 17% to $9.3 billion, Qualcomm said. It posted a profit, minus certain items, of $2.15 a share, matching estimates.\n\nHandset-related sales fell 17% to $6.1 billion, compared with an average estimate of $5.3 billion. Automotive revenue jumped 20% from a year earlier to $447 million, topping projections. And sales from connected devices were in line with estimates at $1.39 billion.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nTwitter\u2019s Unpaid Bills Threaten to Be an Even Bigger Problem for Elon Musk Europe\u2019s \u2018Golden Visa\u2019 Programs Are Dying Out as Housing Costs Rise Cadillac\u2019s Lyriq EV Might Be a Winner If GM Can Build Enough of Them The Company Behind Ben Shapiro Is Trying to Build a Right-Wing Magic Kingdom Private Space Companies in India Prepare for Liftoff\n\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/qualcomm-slides-forecast-signals-phone-220557457.html", "symbols": ["AAPL.MX", "AAPL.US", "AAPL34.SA", "APC.F", "APC.XETRA", "QCI.F", "QCI.XETRA", "QCOM.MX", "QCOM.US"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.649, "neg": 0.052, "neu": 0.89, "pos": 0.057}}, {"date": "2023-05-03T21:48:00+00:00", "title": "Apple\u2019s Unionized Store Workers Seek Tips and Higher Holiday Pay", "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Workers at Apple Inc.\u2019s unionized store in Maryland are asking for higher pay and additional time off, along with changes that could affect the company\u2019s tightly controlled retail experience, such as letting customers tip employees.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nZelenskiy Denies Ukraine Sent Drones to Hit Putin, Kremlin PacWest Is Weighing Strategic Options, Including Possible Sale Banker Pay Surges For Those Willing to Work in Saudi Arabia US Looks Past India\u2019s Rights Record as China Worries Deepen Nigeria Targeted a UK Mansion; Its Next Leader\u2019s Son Now Owns It\n\nThe employees, represented by the International Association of Machinists & Aerospace Workers, are conducting negotiations with Apple on Wednesday and Thursday. Their latest proposal calls for raises of as much as 10%, as well as major changes to the outlet\u2019s vacation policy, bereavement leave and overtime.\n\nThe store in Towson was the first Apple retail location in the US to unionize, and other efforts since then haven\u2019t made much headway. Workers at a location in Oklahoma City agreed to unionize, though negotiations with Apple haven\u2019t begun. Efforts in Atlanta and St. Louis were canceled.\n\nIn addition to an overall raise, representatives from the store are asking Apple for higher pay over a larger slate of holidays, including the day after Thanksgiving. The union is also seeking to expand vacation pay and available time off based on years of service. And it wants to extend paid bereavement leave from 10 days per occurrence to a maximum of 45 days a year and for the policy to include pets and close friends.\n\n\u201cWe realize that this is a negotiation, and these are initial proposals,\u201d the union said in a statement. \u201cOur goal is and always has been to bring back an acceptable contract for the membership to ratify.\u201d\n\nApple, based in Cupertino, California, didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe workers\u2019 negotiators also want Apple to adopt a tipping system, letting patrons offer gratuities in increments of 3%, 5% or a custom amount for in-store credit-card transactions.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cThis will allow thankful patrons the ability to express gratitude for a job well done without any obligations,\u201d the union wrote Apple. \u201cAll monies collected through this manner would be dispersed to members of the bargaining unit biweekly based on any hours worked.\u201d\n\nThe union is seeking to double pay for staffers who work more than eight hours per day or 40 hours per week. They\u2019re asking for an additional boost for employees who work overtime on weekends.\n\nFinally, the union is asking Apple to pay $1 an hour more to employees who become first-aid certified, and to provide as many as 34 weeks of severance pay in the event of a layoff.\n\nSome of these perks are rare in the retail world. That\u2019s created concern among some employees that negotiations will bog down and prevent workers from getting more critical changes approved. Still, the union says it\u2019s negotiated such perks with other companies.\n\nSeparate from economic proposals, the union has reached tentative agreements with Apple regarding a new process to resolve paycheck errors, new language within the company\u2019s nondiscrimination policy, an updated health and safety committee, and a commitment to rehire employees at other locations in the event of a permanent store closing.\n\nOver the past year, Apple has been engaged in a widespread effort to keep its stores from unionizing. Last month, the company held meetings with US retail employees to update them on negotiations with Towson, with the underlying message that if their store unionizes, they may be at a disadvantage. Apple has also highlighted allegations that union representatives misled employees at the St. Louis store that stopped its efforts.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nTwitter\u2019s Unpaid Bills Threaten to Be an Even Bigger Problem for Elon Musk Europe\u2019s \u2018Golden Visa\u2019 Programs Are Dying Out as Housing Costs Rise Cadillac\u2019s Lyriq EV Might Be a Winner If GM Can Build Enough of Them The Company Behind Ben Shapiro Is Trying to Build a Right-Wing Magic Kingdom Private Space Companies in India Prepare for Liftoff\n\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-unionized-store-workers-seek-214800480.html", "symbols": ["AAPL.MX", "AAPL.US", "AAPL34.SA", "APC.F", "APC.XETRA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.979, "neg": 0.046, "neu": 0.87, "pos": 0.084}}, {"date": "2023-05-03T21:37:20+00:00", "title": "Apple Earnings: Here\u2019s what to expect from the call", "content": "Apple is set to release its earnings report on May 4, 2023 at 5 PM eastern.\n\nInvestors will be listening for the company\u2019s revenue growth on the call, among other topics including iPhone and PC demand.\n\nYahoo Finance\u2019s Brad Smith breaks down the three things he\u2019ll be watching on the call.\n\nMake sure you tune into Yahoo Finance's live coverage ahead of Apple\u2019s (APPL) earnings call Thursday.\n\nYahoo Finance Live Programming on Thursday:\n\n- 9:00 am ET: Julie Hyman, Brad Smith will outline what they want to hear from Apple\u2019s earnings call.\n\n- 11:00 am ET:Rachelle Akuffo will discuss how iPhone demand will come into play on the earnings call.\n\n- 4:00 pm ET:Seana Smith  and Akiko Fujita will bring Apple\u2019s earnings to you live.\n\n- 6:00 pm ET: (or when the earnings call ends): Brad Smith and Julie Hyman will have a vibe check with market reaction and a look ahead at what Apple\u2019s results mean for both consumers and investors.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/video/apple-earnings-expect-call-213720496.html", "symbols": ["AAPL.MX", "AAPL.US", "AAPL34.SA", "APC.F", "APC.XETRA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.681, "neg": 0.019, "neu": 0.928, "pos": 0.054}}, {"date": "2023-05-03T21:11:18+00:00", "title": "Taiwan Semiconductor Eyes \u20ac10B Chip Plant Debut In Germany", "content": "Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd (NYSE: TSM) discussed doling out up to \u20ac10 billion ($11 billion) to build a chip fabrication plant in Saxony, Germany.

Get it sent directly to your inbox every Wednesday. Subscribe\n\nWednesday, May 3, 2023\n\nApple could make or break Big Tech's earnings season\n\nBig Tech has, so far, managed to beat Wall Street\u2019s expectations this earnings season. Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Meta (META) have largely outperformed analysts\u2019 estimates despite pull backs in consumer and corporate spending.\n\nBut the industry\u2019s biggest test comes after the bell Thursday when Apple (AAPL) reports its fiscal second quarter earnings results. That\u2019s because the iPhone maker not only serves as a bellwether for the tech sector as a whole, but also on consumer spending.\n\n\u201cNone of what's already been reported matters come Thursday night,\u201d explained Deepwater Asset Management Managing Partner Gene Munster.\n\n\u201cAnd the reason is ... because [of] the size of Apple, and also it's been relatively stable too. It's done a better job of enduring this versus other tech, so if there is a problem, you can throw out all the good news from Microsoft and Google and Meta,\u201d Munster added. Apple CEO Tim Cook gestures at the Apple Fifth Avenue store for the release of the Apple iPhone 14 range in Manhattan, New York City, U.S., September 16, 2022. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly\n\nIn turn, a solid result from Apple could help buoy the industry and drive up shares of other Big Tech names. But a miss could mean increased pressure on rival tech stocks, just as the sector looks to finally move past its COVID-induced hangover.\n\nApple could swing its rivals\n\nAnalysts expect Apple to report revenue of $92.6 billion for the second quarter, a 4.8% decline from the $97.3 billion Apple brought in during the same quarter last year. That's about in line with the 5% decline Apple posted in Q1.\n\n\u201cWe believe the broader tech industry is all on pins and needles waiting for Apple's results as many of the tech haters continue to yell fire in a crowded theater around softening demand, with Apple the best barometer globally of this metric,\u201d Wedbush Managing Director Dan Ives told Yahoo Finance via email.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple, along with rival Microsoft, has a massive influence on the S&P 500 (^GSPC). Together they make up roughly 13% of the index\u2019s market value. Apple, however, outweighs even Microsoft, thanks to its higher market cap of $2.67 trillion. Microsoft\u2019s market cap sits at $2.27 trillion.\n\nFor investors tracking the S&P 500, a miss by Apple could have an outsized impact on their portfolios.\n\nA key to consumer spending\n\nWhile Apple\u2019s enormous size and weight relative to market competitors gives its results added importance, the company\u2019s performance is also a key indicator for consumer spending.\n\n\u201cMost, if not all, iPhones are purchased for consumers. Macs, for the most part, are purchased for consumers and/or small, medium businesses,\u201d explained UBS Managing Director David Vogt. \u201cSo it's really more of a bellwether or a barometer regarding high end consumer spending.\u201d\n\nA miss on Apple\u2019s revenue, especially for its iPhone business, would mean consumers are spending less and holding back on making large purchases. Worse still would be any signal that revenue will come in weaker than anticipated in Q3.

Since Apple accounts for nearly 7% of the total market capitalization of the entire technology sector on the S&P 500 Index, it is worth taking a look at its fundamentals ahead of its quarterly results.\r\n\r\nApple has returned about 30% so far this year, outperforming the industry\u2019s gain of 24.2%.

Wall Street showing its support for the stock, with 77% of analysts holding a buy rating on the tech giant. With more on this and what to expect from Apple, let's bring in Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley. Dan, a number of things to look out for. Obviously, iPhone sales, services, but also now what that banking business is going to start to look like for the company.\n\nDANIEL HOWLEY: Yeah, that's right. And that'll go right into the services aspect of things. Let's just break down some of the numbers here. For Q2, we're expecting a total revenue of $92.6 billion. Now, that would be roughly 5% off of what Apple saw in Q2 2022.\n\nThey were down a little more than 5% in revenue last quarter, as well. And this is something that Apple kind of telegraphed during their prior earnings call, basically saying that they would continue to see the headwinds that they've experienced, whether that's issues with different types of inventory or sales in China and around China, though those should have started to pick up again as those COVID lockdowns ended.\n\nNow, as far as segment revenue, this is where we're going to start to see where the problems lie, at least as far as we can tell from the predictions. Now, Mac growth, that's expected to decline or fall 25% from 2022. We're also looking at iPad. That should decline revenue 12%. iPhone revenue would decline around 3%. And then we can look at services, which would actually grow 6.5%.\n\nNow, the reason for the Mac-- the steep decline in the Mac and the iPad, it's basically the same story we're seeing throughout tech, where PC sales, or in this case Mac sales and iPad sales, are declining because, A, people bought a ton of them during the pandemic, and they don't necessarily need new ones right now, and B, well, they're expensive, and people don't have the money or aren't willing to go out right this second and start buying these expensive products. It also has to do with the fact that Apple released newer products in those lines with newer chips around the same time last year. So we're seeing that kind of hangover.\n\nStory continues\n\nOverall, I think from the analysts that I spoke to, they're expecting Apple to do fairly well this quarter, although some that I spoke to said they could miss on revenue slightly just because of iPhone sales. And I think when you look at the broader picture here, what this has to do with big tech, well, Apple really is the behemoth. Yes, Microsoft is just as-- nearly as large, with its more than $2 trillion market cap, but Apple is still the big dog.\n\nAnd anytime there's any kind of disruption as far as what we see from their results, it's going to impact the rest of big tech. So we'll have to see if the sector's overall performance that we've seen so far-- you know, Meta beating, Google beating, Amazon beating-- if that can hold up and if we'll continue to see that moving forward and investors will be happy, or if Apple misses and we see the rest of big tech suffer, as well.\n\n- Yeah, always a big one to watch there. Apple, of course, as you mentioned, Dan, making that entry into banking. They launched that high-yield savings account last month. What do we know about the take-up so far? What have we heard about the deposits?\n\nDANIEL HOWLEY: Yeah. Early on, there were nearly $1 billion in deposits. And just anecdotally, some analysts that I spoke to said that they were just moving some of their money over there on their own. Now, you get a higher rate when you use Apple Daily money-- or Apple Daily Cash, when that goes directly into the savings account. If you deposit cash separately, it's still above 4%, but it's not as high as when you use the Daily Cash.\n\nBut look, if you have a savings account that's giving you back 4%, I mean, I'm thinking about kicking my bank to the curb because my savings account just gives me nothing. So this is really, I think, something that people are going to continue to look at as an opportunity for Apple to grow in this finance sector. And someone I spoke to had also said, look, it's going from savings to checking at some point, and that Apple may just be your total bank.\n\n- You know, Dan, that makes the two of us when we're talking about where the yields are right now, right? I mean, 4%, that's hard to find. And I imagine a lot of people transferring their money over. But something scares me about putting everything on your phone. I don't think I'm the only one thinking that. Dan Howley there is going to be on top of all of the numbers coming out of Apple.

As the world\u2019s leading consumer products and technology company, Apple\u2019s earnings act as an important bellwether for the broader economy.\n\nApple stock has not disappointed this year and the sturdiness of Apple\u2019s returns simply cannot be understated. The stock is up 30% YTD, 300% over the last five years, and 1100% over the last 10 years. It isn\u2019t flawless though, as it was down -30% during 2022. However, it has nearly earned it all back in the first four months of 2023. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nEarnings Expectations\n\nAnalysts are expecting a YoY decline in Q2 sales, which isn\u2019t great, but also not terrible. Something I don\u2019t often see mentioned about Apple is the strong seasonal tendencies of its revenues.\n\nIn the quarterly revenues chart below we see revenues regularly explode higher following the holiday season and are then mostly stagnant through the rest of the year. But Q1 2023 sales were below Q1 2022, which shows that there was a YoY slowdown in the most recent holiday season. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAdditionally, analyst earnings revisions have been mixed, which gives Apple a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). Q2 expectations are looking down a bit, which lines up with market expectations of a broader economic slowdown in the second half of the year.\n\nAlso concerning, last quarter Apple posted a rare sales and earnings miss. Last quarter marked Apple\u2019s first earnings miss since 2016, which was just -$0.01 below expectations and its second sales miss since 2016, which was also just below expectations. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAnalysts are expecting earnings growth to decline -5.3% YoY to $1.44 a share. The rest of the year is expected to be mostly flat as well, however next year\u2019s earnings are projected to pick up significantly. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBear Case\n\nStory continues\n\nShorting Apple is almost never advised, and although I don\u2019t consider this my base case it is important to address the primary risks. AAPL stock has acted as an incredible haven this year and its returns make up 25% of S&P 500\u2019s total returns YTD.\n\nAt this point investors are treating Apple stock like a Treasury bond, and it has considerably outperformed Treasuries. But is that realistic? Will some doubt start creeping into investors\u2019 minds and cause Apple to roll over.\n\nApple\u2019s most critical profit center is the iPhone, which makes up 52% of total revenue. In the Q1 report, we saw that iPhone sales were down YoY. Management chalked this up to a one-time event and blamed the miss on supply issues related to the lockdowns in China.\n\nWhat if it was a demand issue though? What if we are moving past peak iPhone? The chart below shows total annual smartphone sales, which have clearly peaked. This means that Apple is already fighting an uphill battle.\n\nFurthermore, iPhone quality and longevity is improving, and so are prices, and the length of payment plans. I know personally, the iPhone 11 Pro I bought in 2019 still feels as good as new. Statista\n\nImage Source: Statista\n\nMarket share is another important consideration. Apple currently has an impressive 23% market share of global smartphones. How much room does Apple have to continue to grow this figure?\n\nThe massive Chinese middle class is a very important segment for Apple to target, but what if they start to prefer the Chinese branded phones? Oppo and Xiaomi have made some extremely compelling new phones, particularly their smart flip phones. Flip phones are extremely interesting because they begin to blend phone and tablet products. Flip phones are a product Apple doesn\u2019t have and I haven\u2019t heard rumors of anything in the pipeline. Counterpoint\n\nImage Source: Counterpoint\n\nThe black swan event would be a military conflict between the US and China. In this worst case scenario, it would be highly unlikely that the civil relations between Apple and China continue.\n\nThe concerns listed are more hypotheticals and questions. Of course, Apple has defied all investor logic for over a decade now, and its downfall is an extremely unlikely event. But doubt and fear can move a stock. Is the next 20% move in Apple stock higher or lower? I don\u2019t know, but there are certainly catalysts the give potential to the -20% possibility.\n\nTechnicals\n\nThere isn\u2019t a clean chart pattern to trade AAPL from, but this large range looks significant to me. The $180 level is resistance and $130 support. Right now, price is in no-mans land in the middle of this large range.\n\nIf price can clear the $180 level, resistance should turn into support, and the next multi-year leg higher in Apple should commence. However, a rejection at $180 would be very significant. If the stock can\u2019t clear that level, it may be indicative of not just Apple, but the market more broadly.\n\nWith a recession likely coming later this year, it is possible we will see Apple retest the high of the range, and then as the recession takes hold, swing back down to the bottom of the range. Rather than trying to short the stock, investors would be better off waiting for price to come back down to the $130-$140 buy zone. TradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nValuation\n\nApple is currently trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 28x, which is above the market average and above its five-year median of 24x. This certainly isn\u2019t a cheap valuation, but as one of the world\u2019s leading companies it isn\u2019t particularly expensive either. This reasonable valuation doesn\u2019t play well for the bears. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nApple is a juggernaut in the stock market, and its supremacy is undeniable. While I did lay out a bear case, it is more of an exercise in risk management than anything else. While the dynamics that have propelled Apple to this level over the past decade may change, the biggest risk currently is an economic slowdown.\n\nApple brought luxury to the masses, so if the average person begins to feel the heat of a slowing economy, they probably won\u2019t be buying a new iPhone. But there is a path where the recession is not too bad, and in that case, Apple continues to chug along as the world\u2019s leading stock.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In fact, we\u2019re all aware of most of the top electric vehicle stocks to buy. All thanks to massive demand.\n\nAccording to the International Energy Agency, 10 million EVs were sold in 2022. The agency also noted that \u201cmore than 26 million electric cars were on the world\u2019s roads in 2022, which represents a 60% increase relative to 2021.,\u201d as noted by CNBC.\n\nThe demand is only increasing. Automotive manufacturer, BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDF) saw net income explode 411% in its first quarter, year over year.

As a result, that makes it one of the top EV stocks to own. For one, the world is likely to see lithium shortages by 2025, according to the International Energy Agency, driven by the push to electrify transportation.\n\nThe company also started construction at its Thacker Pass lithium project in Nevada after clearing regulatory hurdles. Even more impressive, the company just received a $650 million investment from General Motors to accelerate the development of the project. LAC should make its first delivery in the second half of 2026, at which point the profits should roll in.\n\nStory continues\n\nGlobal X Autonomous & Electric Vehicles ETF (DRIV) Global X ETFs logo\n\nGlobal X Funds logo. (PRNewsFoto/Global X Funds)\n\nOne of the best ways to diversify your artificial intelligence (AI) exchange-traded funds (ETF) portfolio, as it applies to electric vehicles, is with an ETF, such as the Global X Autonomous & Electric Vehicles ETF (NASDAQ:DRIV). In fact, the DRIV ETF tracks an index that uses AI to select global stocks involved in the development, production, or supporting technology of autonomous and electronic vehicles.\n\nWith an expense ratio of 0.68%, some of its top holdings include Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA),\u00a0Nio\u00a0(NYSE:NIO),\u00a0Qualcomm\u00a0(NASDAQ:QCOM), Apple\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL), Advanced Micro Devices\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMD), and\u00a0Toyota Motor\u00a0(NYSE:TM); it does so at a lesser cost.\n\nSince Jan, the DRIV ETF accelerated from about $20 a share to $22.33.

Ahead of the company's March-quarter earnings release after the market's close on Thursday (May 4th), the Zacks analyst sees Apple's revenues to grow year over year. Growing services subscriber base and a strong liquidity position are key catalysts for Apple\u2019s prospects.\n\nHowever, Apple expects the March quarter\u2019s year-over-year revenue growth to be similar to that of the December quarter due to unfavorable forex. For iPhone, Apple expects the March quarter\u2019s year-over-year revenue growth to accelerate relative to the December quarter\u2019s year-over-year revenue growth.\r\n\r\nFor Mac and iPad, revenues are expected to decline in double digits on a year-over-year basis due to challenging comparison and macroeconomic headwinds. Services revenue growth is expected to be negatively impacted by challenging macroeconomic conditions, as well as weakness in digital advertising and gaming.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Apple here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Microsoft have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the past six months (+43.4% vs. +37.9%). The company\u2019s third-quarter fiscal 2023 results were driven by improvement in Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes, offset in part by a decline in More Personal Computing. Intelligent Cloud revenues increased in the quarter, driven by Azure and other cloud services. Productivity and Business\r\n\r\nProcesses revenues increased due to the Office 365 Commercial. Continued momentum in the small and medium businesses and frontline worker offerings, as well as gain in revenue per user drove top-line growth. More Personal Computing revenues decreased due to Windows and Devices. Steady performance in Talent Solutions aided LinkedIn revenues.\r\n\r\nHowever, declining gaming revenues and videogame sales were headwinds. Increasing spend on Azure enhancements amid stiff competition in the cloud space from Amazon is likely to dent margins.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Microsoft here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Meta Platforms have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Software industry over the past year (+14.7% vs. -14.0%). The company is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its products like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, and Facebook has been a major growth driver. Its restructuring plan is expected to reduce expenses driving profitability.\r\n\r\nHowever, challenging macroeconomic conditions are negatively impacting Meta\u2019s advertising revenues. Unfavorable forex, targeting and measurement headwinds due to Apple\u2019s iOS changes are headwinds. Its second-quarter guidance reflects macroeconomic and forex concerns.\r\n\r\nThe company continues to expect Reality Labs operating losses to increase year-over-year in 2023. Ongoing regulatory developments including the upcoming IDPC decision on transatlantic data transfers is expected to weigh down its prospects.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Meta Platforms here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Diageo plc and 3M Company.\n\nWhy Haven\u2019t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +6.2 average gain per year.

Davidson, who expects iPhone sales there to rise.\n\nStory continues\n\nA near 1% pullback in the dollar during the quarter is also a bright spot in what is typically a weak period following the holiday shopping season, analysts said.\n\nRevenue in its services business, a key growth engine for Apple and home to its App Store and video streaming service, likely rose about 6%, according to Visible Alpha. That would mark its second lowest growth rate since at least the first quarter of fiscal 2017.\n\n\"For Apple, it is much more about a user growth story than a unit growth story,\" said KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Brandon Nispel, who believes efforts to grow market share in developing economies such as India and Brazil will be crucial.\n\nHe expects Apple to have added 30 million users to its active installed user base - the number of active Apple devices in the world. That figure stood at 2 billion as of end December.\n\nThe company is ramping up its manufacturing and store presence in India as it looks to diversify its supply chain and gain consumers.

In other words, you can envision a typical financial advisor speaking well of these enterprises. This just proves that you can\u2019t judge a book by its cover.\n\nAnother reason to consider meme stocks with fundamentals centers on the broader enthusiasm of the retail investor community. Prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, financial advisors bemoaned that millennials weren\u2019t getting involved in the market. Now, they are and it\u2019s possible that this sentiment shift may be permanent. Thus, the increased attention to the equities sector may lift all boats.\n\nFinally, millennials and also older members of Generation Z enjoy rising spending power. Therefore, the securities they like should theoretically see price appreciation. Therefore, here\u2019s my list for meme stocks 2023 (that actually makes sense).\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAAPL Apple $168.54 NVDA Nvidia $282.10 MAR Marriott $178.61 CAT Caterpillar $215.15 CVX Chevron $160.04 AMZN Amazon.com $103.63 IBKR Interactive Brokers $74.13\n\nMeme Stocks to Buy: Apple (AAPL) Apple store. Apple Inc. (AAPL) sells consumer electronics, computer software, services and personal computers.\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs a consumer technology giant, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) offers a sensible \u2013 if not boring \u2013 idea for the best meme stocks to buy. For years, marketing professionals identified Apple as a brand powerhouse. To this day, the tech stalwart continues to enjoy the status of the most valuable brand in the world. Whether we\u2019re dealing with pandemics or bank runs, consumers can\u2019t get enough of Apple\u2019s digital devices.\n\nOn the financial side, Apple brings plenty of firepower to the table. Operationally, the company commands a three-year revenue growth rate of 20%, above 86.44% of sector rivals. Also, it posts a free cash flow (FCF) growth rate of 29.2%, beating out 76% of its peers.\n\nOn the bottom line, Apple prints a trailing-year net margin of 24.56%, outpacing nearly 96% of rivals. It\u2019s also consistently profitable over the past 10 years.\u00a0Finally, Wall Street analysts peg AAPL as a consensus strong buy. However, the average price target of $174.85 implies only 3% upside potential.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeme Stocks to Buy: Nvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) logo and sign on headquarters. Blurred foreground with green trees\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs a tech firm that garnered fame for its graphics processing units (GPUs), it\u2019s no surprise that Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks among the best meme stocks to buy. Sure, these GPUs undergird video gaming applications, which obviously appeal to millennials and Gen Z. At the same time, its processors support other far-reaching endeavors such as data centers and artificial intelligence.\n\nFinancially, Nvidia benefits from significant strengths in the balance sheet, particularly its stratospheric Altman Z-Score of 23.39. This stat indicates high fiscal stability and a low risk of imminent bankruptcy. On the operational side, Nvidia posts a three-year revenue growth rate of 34.5%, above 87.72% of companies listed in the semiconductors industry.\n\nFor profitability, its trailing-year net margin pings at a strong 16.19%, above 70.56% of rivals. However, a noticeable drawback is the forward multiple of 61.73, which is very overpriced.\u00a0Unsurprisingly, analysts peg NVDA as a consensus strong buy. However, their price target of $286.94 implies a little over 3% upside potential.\n\nMeme Stocks to Buy: Marriott (MAR) an empty, sunlit hotel room\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nBreaking away from the tech-oriented meme stocks to buy, Marriott (NASDAQ:MAR) presents intrigue for market participants. Notably, Gen Z desires experiences over more tangible achievements that prior generations aimed for. Thus, some market analysts believe that young folks will help spark a travel resurgence, especially since virtually all jurisdictions have relaxed their Covid-mitigation protocols.\n\nFinancially, Marriott presents somewhat of a mixed bag. On paper, its balance sheet appears rather challenged, particularly its cash-to-debt ratio of 0.05. That\u2019s worse than about 89% of the competition. However, the pandemic did a number on the space. On a more positive note, Marriott\u2019s three-year revenue growth rate comes out to 0.7%, which actually beats out nearly 65% of its peers.\n\nOn the bottom line, Marriott enjoys a trailing-year net margin of 11.35%, above 74% of companies listed in the travel and leisure space. Thus, it could be one of the meme stocks with potential, especially if Gen Z shows up.\u00a0Analysts peg MAR as a\u00a0consensus moderate buy. Their average price target lands at $183.18, implying over 8% upside potential.\n\nCaterpillar (CAT) man's hand holding wads of cash\n\nSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.com\n\nA rather surprising entry among the best meme stocks to buy, Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) carries serious clout as a top manufacturer of construction equipment. Frankly, the idea seems rather boring for young investors but they\u2019re also onto something. Aside from the infrastructure bill, several nations will look to rebuild following Covid\u2019s disruption. Thus, Caterpillar could rise higher.\n\nInterestingly, according to investment resource Gurufocus, CAT stock enjoys five good signs and no yellow or red flags. In my view, Caterpillar\u2019s best attributes center on its profitability profile. For example, its operating and net margins ping at 14.86% and 11.28%, respectively. Both stats rank better than at least 87% of the competition.\n\nHowever, one less-than-desirable feature may be its valuation. Right now, CAT trades at a forward multiple of 13.7, ranked worse than 61.36% of its peers.\u00a0Analysts peg CAT as a consensus hold. Nevertheless, their average price target comes out to $240.47, implying nearly 10% upside potential.\n\nChevron (CVX) Chevron (CVX) sing with \"diesel,\" \"food mart\" and \"car wash\" written underneath\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the world\u2019s biggest oil and natural gas companies, Chevron (NYSE:CVX) deserves to sit at the table of best meme stocks to buy. About a month ago, the oil cartel known as OPEC+ decided to impose a surprise production cut. Effectively, the cartel also proved that the Federal Reserve will not be the only entity to strongly influence the dollar. For investors, the hydrocarbon players suddenly got more interesting.\n\nDespite operating in a somewhat controversial industry, CVX clearly ranks among the meme stocks with fundamentals. It enjoys a stout balance sheet, with an equity-to-asset ratio of 0.62 times, better than 66% of its peers. Operationally, Chevron\u2019s three-year revenue growth rate pings at 18.1%, outflanking 69.72% of sector rivals.\n\nOn the bottom line, Chevron has a trailing-year net margin of 15.05%, beating out 68.62% of the competition. Aside from the Covid-disrupted 2020, it\u2019s also consistently profitable.\u00a0Finally, analysts peg CVX as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target hits $190.44, implying 13% upside potential.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nMoving onto the riskiest segment of meme stocks to buy, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) previously dominated the equities sphere. However, 2022 imposed heavy headwinds on AMZN, particularly due to skyrocketing inflation. With the consumer economy hurting, people didn\u2019t open their wallets with vigor for discretionary products. As a result, even with AMZN\u2019s strong performance this year, over the past 365 days, it\u2019s down over 15%.\n\nStill, AMZN may be worth a look for those seeking speculative meme stocks with potential. Despite the ravages of last year, Amazon still looks relatively decent. For instance, its three-year revenue growth rate comes out to 21.9%, above 84.38% of companies in the cyclical retail industry.\n\nTo be fair, its trailing-year net margin slipped to 0.53% below zero. However, with Amazon\u2019s other relevancies in cloud computing and other tech spheres, it\u2019s worth a wager for the gambling type.\u00a0Lastly, analysts peg AMZN as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target stands at $137.62, implying almost 31% upside potential.\n\nInteractive Brokers (IBKR) An image of a street sign post with directions labeled \"Buy\", \"Hold\", and \"Sell\"\n\nSource: PX Media / Shutterstock\n\nIn my opinion, Interactive Brokers (NASDAQ:IBKR) ranks as the riskiest idea for the best meme stocks to buy. With the Fed committed to tackling inflation by hiking the benchmark interest rate, circumstances don\u2019t seem auspicious for market trading. At the same time, millennials and Gen Z may have sparked a paradigm shift in how they view money. So, it\u2019s possible that IBKR could swing higher.\n\nSo far, shares have performed well, gaining 9% since the January opener. In the trailing year, IBKR impresses with a 30% return. On the financial side, it\u2019s a bit of a wobbly picture. Conspicuously, its balance sheet seems weak. For instance, its Altman Z-Score of only 0.29 indicates distress and a higher risk of bankruptcy in the next two years.\n\nOn the plus side, Interactive\u2019s consistently profitable. Its operating margin is also impressive at nearly 46%. As well, IBKR trades at 2.02 times FCF, which is significantly undervalued.\u00a0Enticingly, analysts peg IBKR as a unanimous strong buy. Their average price target hits $111.40, implying over 43% upside potential.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

According to the latest report from the Labor Department, the unemployment rate stands at 3.5%, indicating a significant recovery as more individuals have returned to work following the Covid pandemic. However, retailers like Best Buy Co., Inc. (NYSE:BBY) have expressed a cautious outlook due to a decline in consumer spending in certain categories like consumer electronics. This shift in consumer behavior has resulted in reduced sales of non-essential items, as individuals prioritize spending on essential goods due to inflationary pressures. The company also laid off hundreds of employees as consumer spending patterns are changing swiftly.\n\nSimilarly, CNBC reported that Foxconn, a major supplier for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), announced a 10% decrease in profit for 2022 and predicted a decline in consumer electronics demand for the entire year ahead. This downbeat sentiment is in line with Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s own cautious expectations for consumer sales. During Apple's first-quarter 2023 earnings report, Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said that they anticipated double-digit declines in Mac and iPad sales for the upcoming March quarter, compared to the previous year. However, the decline in iPhone sales is expected to be less significant in the March quarter compared to the December quarter. Foxconn plans to expand its operations beyond mainland China and has identified exploring new markets as a key priority for the company in 2023.\n\nDespite the near-term outlook muted because of a global recession, the consumer electronics market is expected to witness sustained growth in the coming years, primarily driven by advancements in technology and rapidly changing consumer preferences. These factors will fuel innovation and competition within the industry.According to the Global Consumer Electronics Market report published by Reports Insights, the market achieved a value of $740.79 billion in 2022 and is projected to reach a market size of over $1063.39 billion by 2030, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.62%. The expansion of technologies is a key factor propelling the growth of the consumer electronics market. The increasing demand for compact wearable devices such as earbuds, smartwatches, and smart glasses is driving the growth further. Furthermore, the rising trend of remote work has led to increased adoption of computing devices, contributing to the growth of the consumer electronics market.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe consumer electronics industry is dominated by the highly profitable smartphone business, which holds a significant share of the overall market. Other notable submarkets include personal computers, televisions, and household appliances. Some of the best consumer electronics stocks to buy include Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY), and Best Buy Co., Inc. (NYSE:BBY).

These are the best consumer electronics stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\n\nBest Consumer Electronics Stocks To Buy\n\n10. Universal Electronics Inc. (NASDAQ:UEIC)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 7\n\nUniversal Electronics Inc. (NASDAQ:UEIC) is involved in the creation, advancement, production, and distribution of pre-programmed and versatile control devices, as well as audio-video accessories. The company also specializes in intelligent wireless security systems and smart home products catering to video services, consumer electronics, security, home automation, climate control, and home appliance markets.\n\nOn March 15, investment advisory Sidoti upgraded Universal Electronics Inc. (NASDAQ:UEIC) to Buy from Neutral with a $16 price target. Analyst Gregory Burns issued the ratings update.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s fourth quarter database, 7 hedge funds were bullish on Universal Electronics Inc. (NASDAQ:UEIC), with collective stakes worth $10 million, compared to 6 funds in the prior quarter worth $4.8 million. Ken Griffin\u2019s Citadel Investment Group is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 75,289 shares worth $1.56 million.\n\nLike Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY), and Best Buy Co., Inc. (NYSE:BBY), Universal Electronics Inc. (NASDAQ:UEIC) is one of the best consumer electronics stocks to buy.\n\nCarillon Tower Advisers made the following comment about Universal Electronics Inc. (NASDAQ:UEIC) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:\n\n\u201cUniversal Electronics Inc. (NASDAQ:UEIC) designs and manufactures wireless universal control solutions for home entertainment and smart home devices. The stock was pressured after management gave forward guidance that came in below investor expectations. Despite a number of design wins within its heating, ventilation, and air conditioning and home-automation product lines, the company\u2019s shares have been pressured as it continues to be plagued by component shortages as well as persistent logistical issues at some of its largest customers.\u201d\n\n9. VOXX International Corporation (NASDAQ:VOXX)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 8\n\nVOXX International Corporation (NASDAQ:VOXX) is engaged in the design, production, and global distribution of automotive electronics, consumer electronics, and biometric products.

Forte said this adjustment was due to VOXX International Corporation (NASDAQ:VOXX)\u2019s Q2 earnings falling short of expectations, which he attributed to a challenging sales environment. Despite these near-term challenges, the analyst was optimistic about Voxx's long-term prospects. He believes that the company's partnership with Amazon in automotive efforts, the introduction of related products, and strategic mergers and acquisitions serve as catalysts for future growth.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s fourth quarter database, 8 hedge funds held stakes worth $31.3 million in VOXX International Corporation (NASDAQ:VOXX), compared to 5 funds in the prior quarter worth $29.5 million. Irving Kahn\u2019s Kahn Brothers is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 3 million shares worth $25.2 million.\n\n8. Vuzix Corporation (NASDAQ:VUZI)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 9\n\nVuzix Corporation (NASDAQ:VUZI) designs, manufactures, markets, and sells wearable display and computing devices for augmented reality purposes. These devices cater to both consumer and enterprise markets and are distributed in North America, Europe, the Asia-Pacific region, and other international markets.\n\nVuzix Corporation (NASDAQ:VUZI) reported that its sales in Q1 2023 exceeded $4 million, which represents a growth of over 60% compared to the revenues of $2.5 million generated in the first quarter of the previous year. This performance surpassed the consensus revenue estimate of $3.7 million.

(NYSE:VZIO) and reduced the price target on the shares from $13 to $12. The firm anticipates that the first quarter will represent the lowest point for ad revenue growth. However, due to ongoing challenges in the advertising industry, it has adjusted its overall estimates downward.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s fourth quarter database, 11 hedge funds held stakes worth $11.7 million in VIZIO Holding Corp. (NYSE:VZIO), compared to 10 funds in the prior quarter worth $10.1 million. Raffi Tokatlian\u2019s Ararat Capital is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 739,472 shares worth $5.4 million.\n\nIn addition to Apple Inc.

(NYSE:VZIO) is one of the top consumer electronics stocks to invest in.\n\nHere is what Argosy Investors has to say about VIZIO Holding Corp. (NYSE:VZIO) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:\n\n\u201cReviewing Vizio (NYSE:VZIO), we purchased it quite recently and it has declined precipitously in our brief period of ownership. They have an explicit strategy to sacrifice gross margins from their TVs to further develop the audience for their smart TV offering, a competitor to Roku. I purchased the shares expecting the thesis to play out over a number of years, so I intend to monitor the company and its results as we move forward. Their first quarter results reflected strength in their Platform (Smart TV) segment, which will be their primary source of profit going forward. Further, the news that Netflix and other streaming companies are considering subscriptions that include advertising is positive news. In some ways, what is old is new again, as this development is somewhat of a return to the dual-revenue-stream model cable TV channels use. The shift towards more streaming programming including advertisements is a positive for Vizio, since they may be able to monetize the ads directly or indirectly. I\u2019ll keep you posted on their progress.\u201d\n\n6. Turtle Beach Corporation (NASDAQ:HEAR)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 13\n\nTurtle Beach Corporation (NASDAQ:HEAR) is an audio technology company that operates globally. The company specializes in developing, selling, and marketing gaming headsets and gaming consoles. These products are sold under the Turtle Beach brand. The company also offers gaming accessories, such as keyboards and mice, under the ROCCAT brand. On March 13, Turtle Beach Corporation (NASDAQ:HEAR) announced that its board has authorized an extension of the share repurchase program for an additional two years, now running until April 9, 2025. The program allows the company to repurchase up to $25 million worth of its common stock.\n\nOn April 25, Roth MKM maintained a Buy rating on Turtle Beach Corporation (NASDAQ:HEAR) and set a price target of $16 in anticipation of the company's Q1 results. The firm suggests that revenue is expected to experience a slight decline, as recent data indicates stagnant U.S. retail sales of gaming accessories compared to the previous year. Furthermore, there is continued pressure in the European market. However, Roth MKM expects sales growth for Turtle Beach Corporation (NASDAQ:HEAR) to pick up after Q1, projecting a 15% increase in full-year sales and a $20 million improvement in adjusted EBITDA. Additionally, the influence of activists could potentially trigger actions aimed at maximizing shareholder value, the firm told investors.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s fourth quarter database, 13 hedge funds were bullish on Turtle Beach Corporation (NASDAQ:HEAR), compared to 18 funds in the last quarter. Sander Gerber\u2019s Hudson Bay Capital Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 916,165 shares worth $6.5 million.\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Best Consumer Electronics Stocks To Buy.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n15 Best Dividend Stocks of 2023 10 Best Small Cap Defense Stocks to Buy Now 12 Best Fast Growth Stocks to Buy Now\n\nDisclosure: None.\u00a010 Best Consumer Electronics Stocks To Buy is originally published on Insider Monkey.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-best-consumer-electronics-stocks-173428039.html", "symbols": ["0P1A.F", "AAPL.MX", "AAPL.US", "AAPL34.SA", "APC.F", "APC.XETRA", "BBY.MX", "BBY.US", "BUY.F", "HEAR.US", "SONY.US", "UE1.F", "UEIC.US", "V7XN.F", "VOX.F", "VOXX.US"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 1, "neg": 0.016, "neu": 0.844, "pos": 0.14}}, {"date": "2023-05-02T17:26:52+00:00", "title": "Apple, Google partner to combat creepy tracking tactics", "content": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 Apple and Google are teaming up to thwart unwanted tracking through Bluetooth devices that were created to help people find lost keys, keep tabs on luggage or to locate other things that have a tendency to be misplaced or lost.\n\nThe two companies behind the iPhone and the software that powers Android phones on Tuesday submitted a proposal to set standards for combatting secret surveillance on Apple's AirTag trackers and similar gadgets.

Ahead of the company's March-quarter earnings release after the market's close on Thursday (May 4th), the Zacks analyst sees Apple's revenues to grow year over year. Growing services subscriber base and a strong liquidity position are key catalysts for Apple\u2019s prospects.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, Apple expects the March quarter\u2019s year-over-year revenue growth to be similar to that of the December quarter due to unfavorable forex. For iPhone, Apple expects the March quarter\u2019s year-over-year revenue growth to accelerate relative to the December quarter\u2019s year-over-year revenue growth.\r\n\r\nFor Mac and iPad, revenues are expected to decline in double digits on a year-over-year basis due to challenging comparison and macroeconomic headwinds. Services revenue growth is expected to be negatively impacted by challenging macroeconomic conditions, as well as weakness in digital advertising and gaming.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Apple here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Microsoft have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the past six months (+43.4% vs. +37.9%). The company\u2019s third-quarter fiscal 2023 results were driven by improvement in Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes, offset in part by a decline in More Personal Computing. Intelligent Cloud revenues increased in the quarter, driven by Azure and other cloud services. Productivity and Business\r\n\r\nProcesses revenues increased due to the Office 365 Commercial. Continued momentum in the small and medium businesses and frontline worker offerings, as well as gain in revenue per user drove top-line growth. More Personal Computing revenues decreased due to Windows and Devices. Steady performance in Talent Solutions aided LinkedIn revenues.\r\n\r\nHowever, declining gaming revenues and videogame sales were headwinds. Increasing spend on Azure enhancements amid stiff competition in the cloud space from Amazon is likely to dent margins.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Microsoft here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Meta Platforms have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Software industry over the past year (+14.7% vs. -14.0%). The company is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its products like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, and Facebook has been a major growth driver. Its restructuring plan is expected to reduce expenses driving profitability.\r\n\r\nHowever, challenging macroeconomic conditions is negatively impacting Meta\u2019s advertising revenues. Unfavorable forex, targeting and measurement headwinds due to Apple\u2019s iOS changes are headwinds. Its second-quarter guidance reflects macroeconomic and forex concerns.\r\n\r\nThe company continues to expect Reality Labs operating losses to increase year-over-year in 2023.

Consumers embraced the familiarity of iPhone apps in their cars.\n\nIn comparison, vehicle manufacturers\u2019 own software had always been something of an afterthought, loaded with outdated offline maps and requiring users to navigate a laborious string of menus to connect phones to hands free systems.\n\nGoogle followed a year later with Android Auto, which offered a similar experience for Android phones.\n\nStory continues\n\nSince then, the software has become an expectation, rather than a bonus.\n\nWith the exception of a handful of holdouts all major car manufacturers adopted CarPlay and Android Auto.\n\nBMW was forced to backtrack on plans to charge an annual fee for it after protests from motorists. BMW I4 screen - Christopher Pledger\n\nLast year, Apple said that 98pc of cars sold in the US offer CarPlay, and that 79pc of buyers would only consider a car if it supported the software.\n\nCarmakers continue to sign up: Apple says more than 800 cars support the software, compared to the 600 it quoted last year.\n\nLast year, Apple unveiled a massive upgrade of the software, which will not just act as an entertainment hub but handle central functions of the vehicle such as air conditioning, the fuel gauge and the speedometer.\n\nThe first vehicles supporting the new version are due to be announced later this year.\n\nRichard Windsor, an independent technology analyst, says this will have terrified car executives.\n\nWhile today\u2019s CarPlay system is relatively simple, mirroring the iPhone\u2019s features on a single screen, the upcoming version is a far more ambitious takeover of the car that could be a path to Apple selling hardware to car manufacturers.\n\n\u201cIt makes no sense whatsoever for Apple to sell a car,\u201d Windsor says. \u201cApple makes 40-50pc gross margins on the products it sells, and it will not make that on seats and steering wheels. But it does make sense for Apple to sell an infotainment unit.\u201d\n\nWindsor says carmakers could end up becoming the equivalent of phone networks after Apple entered the mobile market, which led consumers to focus on handsets and led the operators to become commoditised. Tim Cook CEO of Apple - REUTERS/Stephen Lam\n\n\u201cThat's why it is so dangerous for the [manufacturers] because it moves them along that road towards being basically mobile smartphones on wheels.\u201d\n\nMichael Dunne of ZoZo Go, an automotive advisory business, says this comes closer to the nightmare scenario that Dieter Zetsche, the former Mercedes boss, warned of in 2015 when he said the carmaker must not become the \u201cFoxconn of Apple\u201d, referring to the Taiwanese company that assembles iPhones on Apple\u2019s behalf.\n\n\u201c[At that point], where\u2019s the brand? What's the value in the car? That's the risk, that they become irrelevant,\u201d says Dunne.\n\n\u201cWhy do people buy cars? Not that long ago, it was for performance and handling and braking, acceleration, and design. But increasingly, people are basing their decisions on the joy they derive from interacting with a car.\u201d\n\nMajor manufacturers are now trying to go their own way.\n\nTesla, which has invested heavily in its own system instead of embracing CarPlay, has served as an inspiration to manufacturers seeking to distance themselves from Apple.\n\nLast month, General Motors said it would not offer the software in its upcoming electric vehicles, instead working with Google to include systems such as the search giant\u2019s maps in its built-in software.\n\nMercedes has also unveiled plans to integrate Google into its cars.\n\nRoger Lanctot, the director of automotive connected mobility at Strategy Analytics, says more are likely to follow GM.\n\n\u201cCar makers and their suppliers cannot stand Apple. While Google is challenging to do business with, Apple is unbearable and inflexible. Car makers simply can\u2019t stand doing business with the company and suppliers agree,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cCar makers are gambling that a Google-centric connected in-dash system will be far more compelling than anything Apple might be cooking up. No doubt Apple will tell car companies that they have no choice but to adopt the new CarPlay \u2013 that their customers will scream for it. The bottom line is that Apple will deliver a non-negotiable proposition \u2013 which automakers are increasingly inclined to walk away from.\u201d\n\nDunne says that carmakers are hiring thousands of software developers in an attempt to match Apple and Google, but that \u201cit has never been their strong suit\u201d.\n\nThe elephant in the room is the perennial threat that Apple will make its own car.\n\nTim Cook has spent years toying with the idea and explored manufacturing opportunities with the likes of Nissan and Hyundai.\n\nSo far, nothing has come of the idea.\n\nBut Apple might not need to make a car to strike fear into manufacturers.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-apple-bid-control-car-110000310.html", "symbols": ["AAPL.MX", "AAPL.US", "AAPL34.SA", "ABEA.F", "ABEA.XETRA", "ABEC.F", "ABEC.XETRA", "APC.F", "APC.XETRA", "GOGL34.SA", "GOGL35.SA", "GOOG.MX", "GOOG.US", "GOOGL.US"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": -0.559, "neg": 0.051, "neu": 0.9, "pos": 0.049}}, {"date": "2023-05-02T10:15:00+00:00", "title": "3 Stocks You Can Confidently Buy After a Market Downturn", "content": "These market leaders have vast long-term potential, making them prime candidates to scoop up amid a sell-off.\n\nContinue reading", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/m/89173a78-44f1-3eec-a8bb-467af8d97468/3-stocks-you-can-confidently.html", "symbols": ["A1MD34.SA", "AAPL.MX", "AAPL.US", "AAPL34.SA", "AMD.F", "AMD.MX", "AMD.US", "AMD.XETRA", "AMZ.F", "AMZ.XETRA", "AMZN.MX", "AMZN.US", "AMZO34.SA", "APC.F", "APC.XETRA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.153, "neg": 0, "neu": 0.914, "pos": 0.086}}, {"date": "2023-05-02T10:11:00+00:00", "title": "2 Good Reasons to Buy Apple Stock, and 1 Major Risk to Consider", "content": "Few companies have created more wealth for their long-term investors than Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL).

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Apple AAPL, FedEx FDX, Marathon Petroleum MPC and Stellantis STLA.\n\nHere are highlights from Monday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\nIs This the 'Terminal' Fed Hike? Global Week Ahead\n\nIn the Global Week Ahead, regular monetary policy meetings held by:\n\nThe U.S. Fed The European Central Bank (ECB), and Australia's central bank (the RBA) top the agenda\n\nThe mega-cap tech company Apple Inc. brings the U.S. Q1 earnings season mostly to an end.\n\nAll of this happens as financial markets work through fresh regional banking tremors, brought on by First Republic Bank in San Francisco, CA.\n\nNext are Reuters\u2019 five world market themes, reordered for equity traders\u2014\n\n(1) On Wednesday, One More 25bps Policy Rate Hike from the FOMC?\n\nThe Fed is expected to deliver another 25-basis point interest rate increase on Wednesday and signal a pause in its most aggressive rate-hiking cycle since the 1980s.\n\nPolicymakers and markets remain at odds over the rates trajectory: The world's top central bank projects borrowing costs to remain at around current levels through 2023, investors are betting on cuts after the summer.\n\nSigns the Fed may be coming around to the market\u2019s view could push Treasury yields lower - in theory benefiting the big mega-cap stocks that led markets higher this year.\n\nFutures markets show investors pricing a nearly 90% chance of a rate increase. But confidence in a 25-basis point rate hike has wavered in recent days after problems at lender First Republic (FRC) reignited concerns over the U.S. banking sector.\n\n(2) On Thursday, Mega-cap Apple Reports Q1 Earnings\n\nThe U.S. corporate earnings season reaches a crescendo on Thursday with results from Apple, the largest U.S. company by market value, at $2.6 trillion.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlong with other mega-cap stocks, Apple has led the S&P 500's rally in 2023, giving the company even more heft in indexes.\n\nApple's over-7% weight in the S&P500 is bigger than the entire energy sector and nearly matches the consumer staples group.\n\nThe iPhone maker is expected to post $93 billion in revenue for its fiscal second quarter - a 4.4% drop year-on-year, Refinitiv data shows. Analysts expect a nearly -6% drop in earnings per share to $1.43.\n\nThe report from Apple, whose widely used products and services include MacBooks and iPads but also banking, is a gauge for global consumer demand, and its results stand to ripple through markets given its importance to a number of industries.\n\n(3) On Thursday, European Central Bank (ECB) Follows FOMC with Policy Rate Hike\n\nThe ECB will likely lift rates for a seventh straight time on May 4th and policymakers appear to be converging on a 25-basis point hike rather than a larger 50-bp increase.\n\nYet key inflation and bank lending data releases in the days ahead could sway that outcome.\n\nWith some stability returning to the banking sector after the March rout, hawks may feel confident pushing for a large hike.\n\nTuesday's flash April inflation data is likely to confirm underlying price pressures \u2014 running above 5% \u2014 remains uncomfortably high. Some 2.5 million employees in Germany's public sector will get a 5.5% permanent increase next year, a sign that wage pressures are picking up.\n\nBut if bank lending data, also out Tuesday, shows credit conditions have tightened substantially, doves could feel emboldened to push back.\n\n(4) On Tuesday, Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Offers Policy Settings\n\nBets for a return to policy tightening by the Reserve Bank of Australia on Tuesday have fizzled out, after a soft reading of consumer prices added to evidence that inflation peaked at the end of last year.\n\nThat has put the Aussie dollar under pressure, keeping it pinned near the closely watched $0.66-mark, even when the greenback wilted against other major peers.\n\nRBA governor Philip Lowe has stressed a pause at the April meeting did not necessarily mean the tightening cycle is over, and minutes showed a hike was hotly debated.\n\nWhether Lowe, whose term ends in September, will be around to oversee further moves is another question.\n\nSpeculation is rife that, unlike his two predecessors, he won't be asked to stay on.\n\n(5) U.K. Macro Data Updates on Struggling Economy\n\nThe U.K.'s 1970s-style inflation and near-zero growth isn't a good look.\n\nThere isn't a credit crunch \u2014 yet \u2014 according to a recent Bank of England survey. But lenders expect rising defaults on consumer credit, mortgages and corporate loans.\n\nData on Tuesday will show whether house prices are indeed moderating, and if the decline in mortgage lending is stabilizing. New car sales, which in March hit 18-month highs, will also be under scrutiny.\n\nBrits loaded up on credit card debt at the fastest pace in a 24-month period since early 2006 in February and data from the BoE on Thursday will show how that trend is evolving.\n\nThis kind of borrowing isn't cheap. BoE stats show the average interest rate on a UK credit card is 22.5% \u2014 its highest since the mid-1990's. And with more rate rises in the pipeline, the pressure is only likely to intensify.\n\nMeanwhile Prime Minister Rishi Sunak faces his first big electoral test on May 4 in local polls where the opposition Labor Party hopes to capitalize on a year of chaos for the governing Conservatives.\n\nZacks #1 Rank (STRONG BUY) Stocks\n\nHere are three large-cap tech stocks, with Zacks B rating for growth.\n\n(1) FedEx: This is a $226 stock in the Transportation- Air Freight and Cargo space.\n\nIt has a market cap of $56.8B. I see a Zacks Value score of B, a Zacks Growth score of D, and a Zacks Momentum score of A.\n\nFedEx Corp. is the leader in global express delivery services.\n\nThe company, founded in 1971, provides a broad portfolio of transportation, e-commerce and business services through companies competing collectively, operating independently and managed collaboratively, under the FedEx brand.\n\nThe company is currently reporting, primarily through the FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, and FedEx Freight segments.

It is found in the Oil and Gas Refining industry.\n\nIt has a market cap of $54.1B. I see a Zacks Value score of A, a Zacks Growth score of A, and a Zacks Momentum score of B.\n\nMarathon Petroleum Corp. is a leading independent refiner, transporter and marketer of petroleum products.\n\nThe company, in its current form, came into existence following the 2011 spin-off of Houston, TX-based Marathon Oil\u2019s refining/sales business into a separate, independent and publicly-traded entity.\n\nIn October 2018, Marathon Oil completed the acquisition of its rival Andeavor in a $23.3 billion deal, thereby becoming the nationwide largest refining company by market capitalization. The deal also made the company the largest U.S. refiner and the fifth largest in the world by capacity.\n\nMarathon is based in Findlay, OH.\n\n(3) Stellantis: This is a $16 stock in the Foreign-Auto space.\n\nIt has a market cap of $51.4B.

Their growth was mostly fueled by rising Apple product exports.\n\n\u201cThe contribution of exports in \u2018Made in India\u2019 smartphone shipments reached the highest ever in 2022 both in volume (20%) and value terms (30%),\u201d Counterpoint said in a research report published in March. Apple has an estimated market share of 5.5% in India.\n\nHowever, in recent years, Wistron had raked up a few controversies.\n\nFor instance, in 2020, its 2.2 million square foot factory near Bengaluru witnessed violent unrest among workers. The premise suffered damages of $7 million after allegedly underpaid employees vented their anger at the firm.\n\nA government probe revealed that the management had followed several malpractices, Quartz reported earlier. Apple has pressed a pause on business with the company following the row before reviving operations.\n\nStory continues\n\nNow, India\u2019s 150-year-old Tata group reportedly is set to acquire Wistron\u2019s Karnataka factory, which employs over 12,000 people. It could value Wistron\u2019s facility at more than $600 million, Bloomberg reported in January.\n\nIn recent months, the Tatas have taken several steps to increase its business with Apple. The group has accelerated hiring at its own factory in Hosur, near Bengaluru, where it produces iPhone components. It has also announced its plan to launch 100 exclusive Apple stores in India.\n\nMore from Quartz\n\nThe world\u2019s biggest banknote printer said the demand for cash hit a two-decade low What were the world's busiest airports in 2022?\n\nSign up for Quartz's Newsletter.

The growth is expected to be accelerated by a new cycle of system upgrades, which were previously delayed by customers due to concerns about inflation and recession. However, these delayed upgrades are likely to occur later in the year and act as a catalyst for the growth of the PC market, as stated by the research firms. Canalys analyst Ishan Dutt further suggested that the recovery will be supported by a surge in demand from the education sector in major markets, as the devices deployed during the peak of the pandemic reach the end of their life cycle.\n\nStory continues\n\nSome of the best computer hardware stocks to invest in include Apple Inc.

Meanwhile, inflation in the euro inches up ahead of the European Central Bank's own gathering later this week.\r\n\r\n1. Futures inch down but hold near flatline as Fed meeting approaches\r\n\r\nU.S. stock futures were in the red on Tuesday, but largely hovered around the flatline, as attention shifted to what could be a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting (see below) and a string of closely-watched job market data.\r\n\r\nAt 05:25 ET (09:25 GMT), the Dow futures contract traded down by 74 basis points or 0.22%, S&P 500 futures inched down 8 points or 0.15%, and Nasdaq 100 futures dipped 4 points or 0.03%.\r\n\r\nOn the economic data front, the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (aka JOLTS) is due out on Tuesday. The report, which tracks job vacancies and the number of workers who have decided to quit, helps gauge the level of demand in the labor market.\r\n\r\nThe data will serve as a warm-up act before the all-important April jobs report on Friday, which is expected to point to the third-straight monthly deceleration in employment growth.\r\n\r\n2. Fed meeting gets underway\r\n\r\nThe Federal Reserve's two-day policy-setting meeting is set to begin later today.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. central bank has been aggressively tightening monetary policy over the past year in a bid to cool red-hot inflation, but concerns remain over how much these decisions will impact growth. First-quarter gross domestic product figures last week pointed to sluggish overall activity in the world's biggest economy.\r\n\r\nBut recent turmoil in the banking sector - marked this week by the failure of First Republic Bank and JPMorgan's (NYSE:JPM) subsequent takeover of the bulk of its assets - has led many observers to predict that the Fed will pause after this latest hike.\r\n\r\nIn March, policymakers raised rates to their highest level since 2007. Following that meeting, the Fed's \"dot plot\" forecast signaled that one more quarter-point hike was likely in 2023.\r\n\r\n3. Pfizer highlights earnings wave\r\n\r\nPfizer (NYSE:PFE) is among the largest U.S. companies to release their latest results on Tuesday, with investors keen to see how demand for the pharmaceutical giant's COVID-19 products is faring.\r\n\r\nAny possible updates around the group's $43 billion purchase of biotechnology company Seagen in March, which is still being mulled over by regulators, are also expected to be a major focus.\r\n\r\nOther companies set to release earnings today include chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), coffee chain Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), and ridesharing firm Uber (NYSE:UBER).\r\n\r\nThis week will also see numbers from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), the largest American company by market value. The report from the iPhone maker, which is scheduled to be unveiled on Thursday, is typically considered to be an indicator of the strength of global consumer demand.\r\n\r\n4. Debt ceiling pressure rising\r\n\r\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen turned the heat up on lawmakers in Washington, warning that the government will not be able to meet its obligations as soon as June 1 if a deal is not reached to raise or suspend the debt ceiling.\r\n\r\nThe statement, issued in a letter to Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy on Monday, set out a deadline that was earlier than many on Wall Street had expected. Economists at Goldman Sachs had tentatively placed the so-called \"X-date\" - that is, the day when the Treasury can no longer meet its obligations to debtholders - at some time in late July.\r\n\r\nYellen's comments were backed up by the Congressional Budget Office, which also estimated that the Treasury would run out of funds by early June, citing weaker-than-expected tax receipts.\r\n\r\nThe Biden administration has long said it will not meet with McCarthy over the debt limit as long as House Republicans demand that any deal comes with big cuts to some of the president's major spending initiatives. But as June edges closer, the White House will likely face more pressure to join talks.\r\n\r\n5. Eurozone inflation edges higher, but core prices cool\r\n\r\nHeadline inflation in the Eurozone ticked slightly higher as expected in April, in a sign that price growth remains stubbornly elevated as regional rate-setters gear up to unveil their latest rate decision this week.\r\n\r\nThe currency's area consumer price index for the month rose to 7.0% on an annualized basis, according to preliminary data from Eurostat, in line with economists' forecasts. Meanwhile, core inflation, which strips out volatile items like food and fuel, slowed marginally to 5.6%, surprising estimates that the figure would remain unchanged.\r\n\r\nThe April numbers come as the European Central Bank prepares to hold its latest monetary policy meeting on Thursday, with officials widely tipped to raise borrowing costs. However, forecasts differ over whether the ECB will hike rates by 25 basis points or opt for a larger 50 basis point increase.\n\nStory continues\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFed meeting looms, debt ceiling deadline, Eurozone CPI - what's moving markets\n\nTesla raises prices in key markets around the world; not about demand say Citi\n\nCheniere Energy Misses Q1 EPS by 18c; raises guidance", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fed-meeting-looms-debt-ceiling-055205349.html", "symbols": ["AAPL.US", "AMD.US", "JPM.US", "PFE.F", "PFE.MX", "PFE.US", "PFE.XETRA", "PFIZ34.SA", "SBUX.US", "UBER.US"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": -0.901, "neg": 0.078, "neu": 0.858, "pos": 0.065}}, {"date": "2023-05-02T02:45:06+00:00", "title": "Apple-Masimo Trade Secrets Fight Ends With No Jury Verdict", "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. and Masimo Corp. failed to persuade a jury to reach a unanimous verdict in a trial where the medical-devices company claimed a blood-oxygen sensor in the Apple Watch was developed using misappropriated trade secrets.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nJPMorgan Ends First Republic\u2019s Turmoil After FDIC Seizure First Republic\u2019s Jumbo Mortgages Brought On Bank\u2019s Failure Buffett Will Beat the Market as Recession Looms, Investors Say Peak Oil Spells Trouble for Consumers IBM to Pause Hiring for Jobs That AI Could Do\n\nMasimo sought as much as $1.85 billion, claiming that was the amount of illegal profit Apple earned from using its technology.
