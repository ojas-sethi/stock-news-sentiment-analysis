Now, this comes months after shareholders elected one of his director candidates following regulatory roadblocks over the buyout of blood test maker, Grail. Yahoo Finance's Ines Ferre is here with more on the ins and outs of this activist investor battle, been studying it all morning. Ines, what can you tell us?\n\nINES FERRE: Yeah, so billionaire, Carl Icahn, isn't giving in up-- giving up on putting more of his nominees on that board. So Icahn has been a big critic of the $7 billion acquisition of Grail, the cancer detection test maker. Now the deal has brought nothing but regulatory problems for Illumina. Let's back up for a second, and put this all into context for you.\n\nIllumina took over Grail in August 2021, and it did so without securing regulatory approval from the European Union. So subsequently EU regulators blocked that deal on concerns that it was-- that it would stifle innovation. And the EU slapped a fine on Illumina, and then it ordered the company to unwind the Grail deal. Amid all this, you had Icahn-- Carl Icahn that sent a letter to the board saying that his nominees need to be on that board, and that they have experience with dealing with crisis.\n\nStory continues\n\nIcahn said he wanted to strike a deal and avoid a proxy battle in October, but shareholders voted in-- in Andrew Teno. He's a portfolio manager working for Icahn. So he has a win there, and he ousted the chairman. Illumina announced it is divesting Grail, and Icahn reportedly wants more of his people on the board now for the process. And going forward in a letter that was made public in a filing, Icahn wrote, \"It would be a great mistake to allow the legacy conflicted directors to influence Illumina given their history of reckless decision-making and value destruction.\n\nSo basically what he's saying is here. Look, he's been a very big critic of this deal. The deal went south because of the EU regulators. And he is criticizing the board, and he's criticizing the company for having made this deal in the first place and saying that the stock-- if you take a look at the stock, let's pull up the chart if we can for Illumina, the stock is down about 75% since that deal went through in 2021. And it's wiped out about $55 billion in value for shareholders. So he's very angry about that and that's why he wants his people on that board.\n\nBRAD SMITH: All right. This puts perhaps a big cap on. And who knows if there's some late year type of activist activity that's still yet to come forward. But this just the latest in a year full of activist campaigns as well. Yahoo Finance's own Ines Ferre. Thanks so much, Ines.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/video/carl-icahn-initiate-proxy-battle-160213055.html", "symbols": ["ILMN.US", "ILU.F"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": -0.945, "neg": 0.088, "neu": 0.85, "pos": 0.062}}, {"date": "2023-12-19T14:45:00+00:00", "title": "A Lesser-Known Application of Genomics: Reducing Cow Burp Intensity", "content": "DataGene's Sustainability Index for dairy cattle herds combats this significant driver of global warming\n\nNORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / December 19, 2023 / Illumina\n\nOriginally published on Illumina News Center\n\nMethane is 28 times more powerful a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide: It's responsible for a third of global warming. A single cow can produce up to 500 liters of methane a day, or 160 kilograms per year, mostly through eructation (that is, belching). Multiply that by the planet's 1.4 billion cattle, and it might be a burp, not a butterfly wing, that causes a hurricane on the other side of the world.\n\nDairy foods continue to have an important role in feeding the world. It's not the cattle's fault that, by mass, there's more of them than any other mammal on earth (including us). Their digestive systems do what they can with the food we allot them. Given all this, what can researchers do to mitigate bovine belching? They can focus on cattle digestive systems. A cow's methane emissions are influenced by its gut microbiome, and evidence shows that their microbiome composition is influenced in turn by their genotype. Breeding cattle who simply emit less methane than their peers might be ideal-but this research is in its early stages.\n\nHow about focusing on cattle feed? Somestudies have found that adding the methane inhibitor 3-nitrooxypropanol (3-NOP) to a cow's diet reduces their methane output by up to 30%, with no apparent negative impact on their health or milk production. But these studies are also relatively recent, and 3-NOP warrants further research before it can be made commercially available at scale.\n\n\"That will help, and potentially be a much faster improvement,\" says Matthew Shaffer. \"Genetics is a long-term game. It takes time for genetics to work through the system. But the benefits of genetics are permanent and cumulative.\"\n\nShaffer is the CEO of DataGene, an initiative of Dairy Australia that's driving genetic gain and herd improvement in the country's dairy industry. DataGene publishes three indices that track desirable genetic traits among Australia's 1.4 million cattle: A Balanced Performance Index, for traits that affect their lifetime contribution to the farm business; a Health Weighted Index, which fast tracks genetic gain for fertility, feed efficiency, and disease resistance; and a Sustainability Index, which fast tracks genetic gain for reduced methane emissions intensity.\n\nStory continues\n\nThinking in these terms-not gross emissions, but emissions intensity-is another way to tackle the methane problem. Say you have two cows of the same weight, diet, and gross emissions, but every day one produces 20 liters of milk and the other 30 liters. The higher-producing cow dilutes their methane output across more production throughout their lifetime. \"If you need to supply 100 liters of milk, you get it with less methane,\" Shaffer explains. \"But with increased production comes other consequences, on fertility and other traits.\" For example, a longer-lived cow also has a reduced emissions intensity, because the first two years before she can begin producing milk constitutes a smaller percentage of her life. \"That's why emissions intensity is balanced within our index: so we don't cause other issues by chasing only production.\"\n\nGenomic sequencing has enabled dairy farmers to make breeding decisions much faster, with greater accuracy, based on genomic breeding values. No longer do they have to wait to see how productive, fertile, or hardy a bull's progeny are before they decide whether to use that bull for further breeding: These genomic breeding values can be calculated for animals as soon as they're born. This reduces the time between generations and, according to one estimate, saves bull breeding companies up to 92% of their costs.\n\nAustralian dairy farmers looking to order top-quality bull semen can use DataGene's apps to rank animals based on these indices, to fit their particular needs. They can also sequence their female animals simply by taking a small tissue sample, usually from an ear. They send the sample to a genomic service provider, who genotypes it and returns a genomic breeding value for that cow. Equipped with these values, farmers can make more informed decisions about which animals to keep in their herd.\n\n\"We couldn't do what we do without DairyBio, who provide a lot of the research and work closely with Illumina to add SNPs to their systems,\" Shaffer says, referring to the genetic markers that this genotyping looks for.\n\nDataGene's next big project is aggregating vast amounts of new sequencing data into their Central Data Repository (CDR). \"We're connecting the CDR to various equipment manufacturers to bring new data we've never seen before,\" Shaffer says. \"Some of it will be milking machine information from robots; some will be information from companies we don't currently have access to. It's really important to expand the CDR, which will enable us to produce better tools and analytics for farmers.\"\n\nIt's not always the case that a company CEO starts out on the \"shop room floor\" in the same industry. But Shaffer grew up milking cows by hand on his grandmother's farm; his first paying job was as a milker on a larger farm. \"So I've got milk in my veins, as it were,\" he jokes. But that means this work holds great personal meaning to him. \"What gets me up every morning is the desire to enable farmers to make better decisions and breed better animals, and the corollary impact that has on the environment and on people's health.\"\n\nWith the strength of knowledge from all these tools, breeding a more sustainable cow is not just a good idea-it's a mooovement.

Elsewhere, gene-sequencing group Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN) announces plans to divest blood cancer-test seller Grail following intense antitrust scrutiny and shares in China's SenseTime slip after it announces the death of its founder.\n\n1. Futures edge higher\n\nU.S. stock futures inched higher on Monday, pointing to a possible extension in a Christmastime rally that has been fueled by hopes for a Federal Reserve policy pivot next year.\n\nBy 05:01 ET (10:01 GMT), the Dow futures contract had gained 73 points or 0.2%, S&P 500 futures had risen by 12 points or 0.2%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had inched up by 23 points or 0.1%.\n\nThe main indices on Wall Street were mixed to end the previous week after New York Fed President John Williams noted that policymakers were not \"really talking about\" interest rate cuts \"right now.\" The comments served to temper hopes that the central bank would start to lower rates from more than two-decade highs as early as the spring.\n\nLast week, the Fed voted to keep borrowing costs steady at 5.25% to 5.50%. However, fresh quarterly projections showed that members, buoyed by signs of cooling inflation and resilient economic growth, were pricing in 75 basis points in cuts in 2024. The announcement helped lift the benchmark S&P 500, 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average, and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite to their seventh consecutive week of gains. U.S. Treasury yields, which move inversely to prices, also slipped.\n\n2. Gold shines\n\nThe Fed's dovish outlook has also driven a jump in gold prices, putting the yellow metal on pace for its first annual increase since 2020.\n\nAccording to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool, investors now see a roughly 65% chance that the bank will unveil a quarter-point rate reduction as soon as March next year, up from just under 42% in the prior week. The probability that the Fed will roll out a further cut in May stands at around 58%, well above last week's mark of about 24%.\n\nStory continues\n\nThese expectations have dented the appeal of holding zero-yield bullion. A slide in the U.S. dollar has also burnished gold, making it less expensive for overseas buyers. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies, shed 1.3% last week.\n\nAt 05:01 ET on Monday, spot gold prices had risen by 0.2% to $2,023.13 per troy ounce.\n\n3. Illumina to divest Grail\n\nIllumina has said it will divest cancer-screening start-up Grail, as the gene-sequencing device maker looks to appease antitrust regulators in both the U.S. and Europe.\n\nIn a statement on Sunday, San Diego-based Illumina noted that divestiture will be executed through a \"third-party sale or capital markets transaction.\"\n\nIllumina acquired Grail in 2021 in an agreement that valued the seller of a blood test designed for the early detection of cancer at $7.1 billion. However, the agreement has faced heavy scrutiny, particularly after it was completed without the formal approval of the European Commission. The divesiture of Grail would be \"consistent\" with an order from Brussels, Illumina noted.\n\nThe troubled deal has also faced pushback from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, which flagged that Illumina could deny crucial inputs into cancer-detecting blood tests offered by Grail's rivals.\n\nOn Friday, a federal appeals court found that while the FTC was right to issue the challenge, it must conduct a new review of the purchase. Illumina said it would not appeal the ruling.\n\nShares in Illumina edged higher in premarket trading in New York on Monday.\n\n4. SenseTime shares slip after AI firm announces death of co-founder\n\nShares in SenseTime Group (HK:80020) slumped on Monday, touching an all-time low, after the Chinese artificial intelligence business announced that founder Tang Xiao'ou had died.\n\nSenseTime (HK:0020) said over the weekend that Tang had died of an unspecified illness on Friday. He was 55 years old, CNBC reported.\n\nTang, a professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, set up SenseTime in 2014. Its AI-based content generation and facial recognition technology have since received strong demand from both the public and private sectors.\n\nBut the firm has also been blacklisted by U.S. authorities since 2019. Washington has alleged that SenseTime aided Beijing in running state surveillance of Uyghur minorities in China's Xinjiang region.\n\n5. Oil choppy\n\nOil prices were volatile on Monday, as traders weighed Russian export reductions and jitters over attacks on commercial vessels in the Red Sea with weak business morale data out of top European economy Germany and a fresh forecast from Goldman Sachs.\n\nBy 06:23 ET, the U.S. crude futures traded 0.5% higher at $72.17 a barrel, while the Brent contract climbed by 0.6% to $76.99 per barrel. Both benchmarks posted limited gains last week, stemming seven straight weeks of declines, thanks in large part to hopes for Fed rate cuts next year.\n\nCrude prices received support from Russia, which said on Sunday that it would deepen oil export cuts in December by around 50,000 barrels per day. Additionally, concerns are growing over the potential for disruption to global supplies as a number of shipping firms said they would avoid the Suez Canal given the increase in assaults on commercial vessels in the Red Sea by Houthi militants in Yemen.\n\nHowever, according to figures from the Ifo Institute, the mood amongst German companies unexpectedly worsened in December, with energy-intensive industries \"having a particularly tough time.\" The survey said that firms were \"more skeptical about the first half of 2024.\"\n\nAlso impacting sentiment was a decision by Goldman Sachs to trim its price expectations for Brent crude in 2024 by $10 per barrel to between $70 to $90. The bank said strong U.S. output could mitigate possible upward pressure on oil prices.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFutures edge up, Illumina to divest Grail - what's moving markets\n\nFed's Mester says next phase is to see how long its policy needs to remain 'restrictive' - FT\n\nHigher rates trigger big retreat in global non-bank sector", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/futures-edge-illumina-divest-grail-062443066.html", "symbols": ["0020.HK", "80020.HK", "ILMN.US", "ILU.F"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": -0.631, "neg": 0.079, "neu": 0.84, "pos": 0.081}}, {"date": "2023-12-18T01:16:00+00:00", "title": "Illumina to Shed Cancer-Test Maker Grail After Antitrust Battle", "content": "Gene-sequencing company Illumina said Sunday it will divest itself of cancer blood test maker Grail, following Illumina\u2019s loss in its legal battle against U.S. antitrust regulators.

(NASDAQ: ILMN) announced that the company will divest GRAIL.\n\nThe divestiture will be executed through a third-party sale or capital markets transaction, consistent with the European Commission's divestiture order, with the goal of finalizing the terms by the end of the second quarter of 2024.\n\nOn December 15, the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals issued its decision in the matter of Illumina v. the Federal Trade Commission.

As the company has previously stated, if it was not successful with either its European Court of Justice jurisdictional appeal or in a final decision of the Fifth Circuit, it would divest GRAIL.\n\n\"We are committed to an expeditious divestiture of GRAIL in a manner that allows its technology to continue benefitting patients,\" said Jacob Thaysen, CEO of Illumina. \"The management team and I continue to focus on our core business and supporting our customers.
