The grant will provide 1008 samples of the Infinium\u2122 Global Diversity Array with Polygenic Risk Score Content plus Illumina Polygenic Risk Score software-Predict module to generate polygenic risk scores (PRS) for pain and opioid use disorder.\n\n\"Polygenic risk scores represent a person's relative genetic liability for a behavior, disease, or psychiatric disorder, and are created using summary results from genome-wide association studies (GWAS),\" says Johnson. \"In this case, we're interested in using the results from GWAS for chronic pain and opioid use disorder-which have identified genetic variations between people who experience either chronic pain or opioid use disorder and those who don't-and using that data to create polygenic risk scores in a unique and diverse cohort.\"\n\nThe contest received submissions from noteworthy research groups in nine different countries spanning North and South America, Europe, and Asia. Each entry was judged on novelty, feasibility, scientific merit, potential impact on human health, and the authors' previous accomplishments.\n\nWhile chronic pain and opioid use are known to be genetically correlated, previous GWAS never investigated these disorders simultaneously in carefully characterized groups. Instead, the studies focused on the causal relationship between them.\n\nJohnson and collaborator Simon Haroutounian, PhD, chief of the Division of Clinical and Translational Research and chief of Clinical Pain Research at Washington University Pain Center, wondered if genetic factors might influence that relationship. For example, different genetics might affect the reward processes that govern how people perceive pain or respond to opioids.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Dr. Haroutounian has been studying a unique cohort with deep clinical phenotyping for chronic pain, opioid use, and opioid craving, as well as symptoms of depression and anxiety,\" says Johnson. \"Also, the DNA has already been extracted from this diverse group of 1500 samples. Winning this contest will allow us to genotype just over a thousand of those samples. Then we'll use Illumina's PRS software with the Predict module to create scores for chronic pain and opioid use disorder.\"\n\nIn addition, the team, which also includes collaborator Arpana Agrawal, PhD, will perform a cross-trait multivariate genome-wide study to look at potential genetic factors that are shared across chronic pain and opioid use disorder. From there, they can link these PRS to baseline preoperative pain and acute and chronic postoperative pain, as well as anxiety, depression, pain ratings, and analgesic craving.\n\n\"This was the perfect opportunity to genotype this unique cohort to better understand the relationship between chronic pain, substance use, and other psychosocial factors,\" says Johnson. \"We hope this work will improve the management and treatment of chronic postsurgical pain, eventually giving clinicians a better tool to identify patients who might be at greater risk of developing an opioid use disorder alongside their chronic pain.\"\n\nThe Illumina Polygenic Risk Scores Research Grant was launched to recognize researchers who can drive advances in genetic risk prediction. Although PRS can impact complex disease research and healthcare in various ways, unraveling the complexities of the genome using the full potential of PRS-based research remains a developing field that is rich with opportunities for scientific advancements.

One student describes her summer experience\n\nOriginally published on Illumina News Center\n\nNORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / October 10, 2023 / When Adee Newman started her summer as a research associate Intern at Illumina in June 2023, she had no prior industry experience. Originally from Palo Alto, California, she spent two years at De Anza College before transferring to University of California, San Diego (UCSD). Currently, she is a master's student in biology with a research emphasis of epigenetics and genomics at UCSD.\n\nNewman's internship was based in San Diego, but she was able to work remotely. We caught up with her at the end of her internship last month to hear about her experience.\n\nHow did you first become aware of Illumina? Why did you apply for an internship?\r\nAdee Newman: We use Illumina sequencers in the lab that I do research in, which is how I first learned about Illumina. I saw a few ads for the internship on LinkedIn and Handshake and applied when I got a message from a recruiter. I was curious about experiencing industry so I can make an informed decision about my next career decision-so this felt like the perfect opportunity!\n\nHas anything surprised you about working in industry?\r\nAN: I wasn't sure what to expect the day-to-day to be like, but it has been wonderful. I appreciate the independent work, but it doesn't get lonely either, as we collaborate a lot. I've learned about organizational structures and various other career paths. There is no \"right way\" to go about your career path and you should keep an open mind when you are starting out! In speaking with people within the company I've received a lot of advice and fresh perspectives, which is unbelievably valuable to me at this point in my career.\n\nWhat kind of work are you doing?\r\nAN: I'm interning with the Clinical Affairs team and I've learned so much about clinical trials. My internship project was creating a process map of all the actions and activities that are required during a clinical trial, as well as reviewing the standard operating procedures and work instructions for the various activities. I also met with subject matter experts from various Clinical Affairs teams-protocol and clinical study report writing from Medical Writing, data handling from Clinical Data Management, and others-to better understand the process and better create a process map.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat did you learn about clinical trials?\r\nAN: My favorite thing I learned is that we're able to have a direct impact on people and health outcomes much sooner just with how clinical trials work-it's so complex and has so much cross-functional collaboration, it basically looks like a Chutes and Ladders game. You can take some steps that can move you through the board faster, but if someone wants to change something or if there's an issue with a specific aspect, you might hit a chute and it could take you back almost to the start! Because of that, teamwork and collaboration are extremely important, and I love that about Clinical Affairs.\n\nAre you interested in pursuing any specific area in biotech? \r\nAN: I'd love to work on and support various clinical trials that focus on improving aspects of human health on a large scale. I think it would be amazing to work on a project that would help or provide a solution for a problem that affects a large population. It would also be great to work on oncology and companion diagnostics.\n\nHas your internship experience helped you determine the next steps in your career?\r\nAN: Yes! Hearing everyone's experiences has helped me decide that I will likely work for a few years before deciding if I want to continue or go back to academia. If you want to pursue academia, you should be passionate about it-otherwise it may not be the right career choice for you.\n\nWhat advice would you give students contemplating moving from academia to industry?\r\nAN: Give it a try! If you are curious about it, you should experience it for yourself so you know what you will be doing. It's one thing to hear from people, but another thing to see it for yourself. Don't be scared of stepping out of your comfort zone.\n\nIllumina's internship program introduces students to the corporate world while remaining centered around learning: learning about yourself, learning about the biotech and genomics industries, and learning from experienced professionals and leaders in your field. Each summer, our interns apply their knowledge to impactful projects and discover the various career paths available to them. The hands-on work, professional development workshops, and simple conversations with mentors and peers can influence one's path forward. Interested in experiencing life at Illumina?
