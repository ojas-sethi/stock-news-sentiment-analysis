He will take the seat of board Chairman John Thompson, who failed to win reelection.\n\nIllumina's market value of $30 billion made the fight this year's largest proxy contest to go to a shareholder vote. Its shares closed down 9% at $193.53 on Thursday after Icahn failed in his bid to change the company's management by also ousting Chief Executive Francis deSouza from the board.\n\nIcahn had accused Illumina of poor oversight, especially with regard to its $7.1 billion acquisition of cancer test maker Grail. Illumina completed the deal despite opposition from U.S. and European antitrust regulators, who are now trying to force the company to unwind it.

Some companies lobbied against the changes, arguing it favored activist investors.\n\nIllumina shareholders also voted against the pay arrangements of top executives in an another blow to the company.
