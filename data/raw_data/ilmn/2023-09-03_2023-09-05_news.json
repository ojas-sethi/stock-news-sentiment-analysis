But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.\n\nThere are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.\n\nExelixis and Illumina are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #4 (Sell), respectively, right now. This means that EXEL's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.\n\nValue investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.\n\nOur Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.\n\nEXEL currently has a forward P/E ratio of 23.10, while ILMN has a forward P/E of 202.05. We also note that EXEL has a PEG ratio of 1.12. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. ILMN currently has a PEG ratio of 9.10.\n\nAnother notable valuation metric for EXEL is its P/B ratio of 2.86. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, ILMN has a P/B of 4.06.\n\nStory continues\n\nThese are just a few of the metrics contributing to EXEL's Value grade of B and ILMN's Value grade of D.\n\nEXEL sticks out from ILMN in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that EXEL is the better option right now.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value Trap", "content": "Value-focused investors are always on the hunt for stocks that are priced below their intrinsic value. One such stock that merits attention is Illumina Inc (NASDAQ:ILMN). The stock, which is currently priced at $161.2, recorded a loss of 4.31% in a day and a 3-month decrease of 23.3%. The stock's fair valuation is $337.35, as indicated by its GF Value.\n\nUnderstanding the GF Value\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with ILMN. Click here to check it out.  ILMN 30-Year Financial Data The intrinsic value of ILMN\n\nThe GF Value represents the current intrinsic value of a stock derived from our exclusive method. The GF Value Line on our summary page gives an overview of the fair value that the stock should be traded at. It is calculated based on three factors:\n\nHistorical multiples (PE Ratio, PS Ratio, PB Ratio and Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow) that the stock has traded at. GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth. Future estimates of the business performance.\n\nWe believe the GF Value Line is the fair value that the stock should be traded at. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. On the other hand, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher. Is Illumina (ILMN) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value Trap\n\nScrutinizing the Risks\n\nHowever, investors need to consider a more in-depth analysis before making an investment decision. Despite its seemingly attractive valuation, certain risk factors associated with Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN) should not be ignored. These risks are primarily reflected through its low Piotroski F-score and high Beneish M-score. These indicators suggest that Illumina, despite its apparent undervaluation, might be a potential value trap. This complexity underlines the importance of thorough due diligence in investment decision-making.\n\nCompany Overview\n\nIllumina provides tools and services to analyze genetic material with life science and clinical lab applications. The company generates over 90% of its revenue from sequencing instruments, consumables, and services. Illumina's high-throughput technology enables whole genome sequencing in humans and other large organisms. Its lower throughput tools enable applications that require smaller data outputs, such as viral and cancer tumor screening. Illumina also sells microarrays (less than 10% of sales) that enable lower-cost, focused genetic screening with primarily consumer and agricultural applications.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite the promising fair value of $337.35, Illumina's stock is currently priced at $161.2. This discrepancy, coupled with the company's low Piotroski F-score and high Beneish M-score, warrants a cautious approach. Is Illumina (ILMN) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value Trap\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, while Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN) appears to be undervalued at first glance, the potential risks associated with the stock suggest that it might be a value trap. The low Piotroski F-score and high Beneish M-score are red flags that investors should not ignore. Therefore, a prudent approach would be to conduct thorough due diligence before making an investment decision.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/illumina-ilmn-too-good-true-153534909.html", "symbols": ["ILMN.US", "ILU.F"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.985, "neg": 0.085, "neu": 0.769, "pos": 0.146}}, {"date": "2023-09-05T15:33:00+00:00", "title": "Illumina Names Jacob Thaysen as New CEO", "content": "Jacob Thaysen was named to the role after Francis deSouza resigned from the gene-sequencing maker in June amid a fight with regulators.\n\nContinue reading", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/m/52eaca92-7545-325a-8c9c-429d844c3f98/illumina-names-jacob-thaysen.html", "symbols": ["ILMN.US", "ILU.F"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": -0.557, "neg": 0.18, "neu": 0.82, "pos": 0}}, {"date": "2023-09-05T14:36:52+00:00", "title": "Lowe's and Oracle upgrades, Illumina CEO: Market Movers", "content": "Stocks trend lower this morning entering the first trading of September, a historically weak month for markets.

(NASDAQ: ILMN), a global leader in DNA sequencing and array-based technologies, today announced that its Board of Directors has appointed Jacob Thaysen, Ph.D., senior vice president of Agilent Technologies and president of its Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group, as Chief Executive Officer, effective September 25, 2023. Illumina, Inc. Logo\n\nMr. Thaysen's extensive background and experience in genomics, life sciences, and technology fits closely with Illumina's mission. Since 2018, he has overseen the unit responsible for Agilent's market-leading analytical instrument portfolio, informatics, and cell analysis franchise.
