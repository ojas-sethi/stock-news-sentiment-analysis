[{"date": "2023-11-10T23:12:00+00:00", "title": "Illumina, Inc. investors: Please contact the Portnoy Law Firm to recover your losses", "content": "LOS ANGELES, Nov.  10, 2023  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Portnoy Law Firm advises Illumina, Inc. (\u201cIllumina\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (NASDAQ: ILMN) investors that a lawsuit filed on behalf of investors that purchased Illumina securities between May 1, 2023 and October 16, 2023, inclusive (the \u201cClass Period\u201d).\n\nInvestors are informed that they must petition the Court within 60 days from the issuance of this notice if they wish to act as the lead plaintiff in this case.\n\nInvestors are encouraged to contact attorney Lesley F. Portnoy,\u00a0by phone 844-767-8529 or email: lesley@portnoylaw.com, to discuss their legal rights, or click here to join the case via www.portnoylaw.com. The Portnoy Law Firm can provide a complimentary case evaluation and discuss investors\u2019 options for pursuing claims to recover their losses.\n\nIllumina disclosed on August 10, 2023, after market hours, that the SEC was examining the company's declarations about its recent purchase of GRAIL, Inc., including issues related to the behavior and remuneration of some Illumina and GRAIL managers.Following this announcement, Illumina's share price dropped by $4.64, or 2.5%, ending at $180.48 on August 11, 2023.Later, on October 17, 2023, Carl Icahn filed a lawsuit against current and former Illumina directors, accusing them of breaching their fiduciary responsibilities. Although the lawsuit was initially sealed, Reuters reported that Icahn, at the 13D Monitor Active-Passive Investor Summit in New York, stated the lawsuit concerned Illumina's completion of its acquisition of cancer diagnostic test producer Grail.Subsequently, Illumina's stock price fell again by $7.42, or 5.6%, closing at $124.45 per share on October 18, 2023.The lawsuit in this class action claims that during the Class Period, the Defendants provided false and/or misleading statements and failed to reveal crucial negative information about Illumina's business, operations, and future. Specifically, it alleges that the Defendants did not inform investors that: (1) some company insiders had personal financial reasons for acquiring GRAIL; (2) Icahn's criticism, contrary to Illumina's attempts to downplay it, was accurate in identifying a misalignment between insiders\u2019 interests and the Company\u2019s; and (3) consequently, the Defendants' optimistic comments about Illumina's business, operations, and prospects were significantly misleading and/or lacked a solid foundation.\n\nThe lawsuit contends that when these undisclosed details became public, investors suffered financial losses.\n\nPlease visit our website to review more information and submit your transaction information.\n\nThe Portnoy Law Firm represents investors in pursuing claims against caused by corporate wrongdoing.

(Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. \r\nI would now like to hand the conference over to Salli Schwartz, Vice President of Investor Relations.\n\nSallilyn Schwartz\n\nHello, everyone, and welcome to our earnings call for the third quarter of 2023. During the call today, we will review the financial results we released after the close of the market and offer commentary on our commercial and regulatory activity, after which we will host a question-and-answer session. Our earnings release can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at illumina.com. \r\nParticipating for Illumina today will be Jacob Thaysen, Chief Executive Officer; and Joydeep Goswami, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Strategy and Corporate Development Officer. Jacob will provide an update on the state of Illumina's business, and Joydeep will review our financial results, which include GRAIL. \r\nAs a reminder, GRAIL must be held and operated separately and independently from Illumina pursuant to the transitional measures ordered by the European Commission, which prohibited our acquisition of GRAIL under the EU merger regulation. \r\nThis call is being recorded, and the audio portion will be archived in the Investors section of our website. \r\nIt is our intent that all forward-looking statements regarding our financial results and commercial activity made during today's call will be protected under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual events or results may differ materially from those projected or discussed. All forward-looking statements are based upon current available information, and Illumina assumes no obligation to update these statements. \r\nTo better understand the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ, we refer you to the documents that Illumina files with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including Illumina's most recent Forms 10-Q and 10-K. \r\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Jacob.\n\nStory continues\n\nJacob Thaysen\n\nThank you, Salli. Good day, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. As you know, I assumed the role as Illumina's CEO a little over 6 weeks ago. It is an honor to lead this company. I joined Illumina after more than a decade at Agilent, where I ran both the Diagnostic and Genomics Group; and more recently, Agilent's largest business, the Life Science and Applied Markets Group. I have long admired Illumina for its role in building the genomics market, and I'm incredibly excited to be here. \r\nDuring my first weeks, I prioritized getting to know our employees and meeting with several of our customers. Illumina has a highly capable team, and I have been impressed with their level of passion and commitment to our work. Both our employees and our customers are driven to move genomics forward. \r\nLike our team, I'm passionate about genomics and the role that this field can play in health care and personalized medicine, particularly in the oncology space. This is a massive opportunity, and Illumina will remain the key player even as others enter the market. Illumina's infrastructure that they have built over 2.5 decades, our compelling offerings that sets the global standard and our deep commitment to innovation for the future will continue to drive the use of genomics and multiomics around the world. \r\nTurning to our third quarter results. In Q3, Illumina delivered revenue of approximately $1.12 billion, flat year-over-year or up 1% on a constant currency basis. This was a disappointing result. The macroeconomic environment remains challenging for our industry and for our customers with customers increasingly cautious and constrained in their purchasing decisions. \r\nDespite a lower gross margin year-over-year, tight management of our operating expenses allowed us to deliver diluted non-GAAP EPS of $0.33, also approximately flat year-over-year. While we cannot control external environment, Illumina's management team and I remain focused on supporting our customers and our own operational execution. \r\nPart of my comprehensive review of the business includes reexamining our strategic initiatives and our targets for long-term revenue growth and operating margins. We will lay out our new targets for you later next year. \r\nA key priority for me is to get clarity on the GRAIL situation. Therefore, I have requested and the Board has established a special committee to expedite decisions on GRAIL. Furthermore, we have retained advisers and are preparing for sale and capital markets transactions. We expect to file a Form 10 on a confidential basis with the SEC. Hereafter, we will contact third parties as investment capital sources or as potential purchases as our appeals are ongoing. \r\nI know there have been questions regarding our appeals. These appeals are not just about GRAIL. They provide Illumina with flexibility for any divestiture of GRAIL and also for future transactions. The appeals will not impact our ability to move swiftly. Make no mistake, I'm here to focus on the core business, which I will talk more about after Joydeep's remarks. Joydeep?\n\nJoydeep Goswami\n\nThank you, Jacob. I'll start by reviewing our consolidated financial results, followed by segment results for core Illumina and GRAIL and then conclude with my remarks on our current outlook for 2023. I will be discussing non-GAAP results, which includes stock-based compensation. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures, which can be found in today's release and in the supplementary data available on our website. \r\nAs Jacob noted, in the third quarter, consolidated revenue of $1.12 billion was flat year-over-year and up 1% on a constant currency basis. Consolidated revenue was down 5% from the second quarter of 2023. Although we correctly anticipated a sequential decrease in high-throughput consumables revenue due to the NovaSeq X transition, we placed fewer NovaSeq X instruments than we expected in the quarter as customers purchase constraints led to lengthened sales cycles. \r\nNon-GAAP net income was $52 million or $0.33 per diluted share, which included dilution from GRAIL's non-GAAP operating loss of $155 million for the quarter. Despite our lower revenue, non-GAAP EPS exceeded our expectations primarily due to continued execution of expense-reduction initiatives and a higher gross margin than we forecast. \r\nGAAP net loss was $754 million or $4.77 per diluted share, which included goodwill and intangible impairments of $821 million related to the GRAIL segment. These impairments were primarily the result of a decrease in Illumina's consolidated market capitalization and a higher discount rate used for the fair value cancellation of the GRAIL segment. \r\nOur non-GAAP tax rate was 39.7% for the quarter, which decreased from 43.2% in Q3 2022 with both quarters reflecting the impact of R&D capitalization requirements. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the non-GAAP tax expense, impact of R&D capitalization requirements given increased amortization of capitalized R&D expenses. Our non-GAAP weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was approximately 158 million. \r\nMoving to segment results. Core Illumina revenue of $1.11 billion was flat year-over-year on both a reported and constant currency basis and included anticipated reductions of approximately 7 percentage points from 2 primary categories: one, the decrease in COVID surveillance and the effect of sanctions in Russia that together represent approximately 3.5 percentage points; and two, the year-over-year reduction in China revenue, that also is approximately 3.5 percentage points. \r\nCOVID surveillance contributed approximately $4 million in total revenue in Q3 2023 compared to $28 million in Q3 2022. Core Illumina sequencing consumables revenue of $695 million was down 4% year-over-year. The decrease was primarily driven by a 12% decline in sales to research customers. These customers were impacted by the NovaSeq X transition and are reducing NovaSeq 6000 consumables purchases before they have fully ramped up activity on NovaSeq X. \r\nTotal sequencing consumables revenue was also impacted by the COVID, Russia and China factor, I noted previously, as well as the impact of macroeconomic conditions and customers' purchasing power and project planning. Strength in sales to clinical customers partially offset the decline in research with clinical sequencing consumables growing 10% year-over-year, led by continued momentum in oncology and genetic disease testing. \r\nTurning to sequencing activity. Total sequencing gigabase output connected high- and mid-throughput instruments grew 5% from Q2 2023 and 29% year-over-year. We are encouraged by the trends we are seeing across both research and clinical high-throughput customers that have a NovaSeq X installed. As expected, these customers show higher overall growth in sequencing output than high-throughput customers that have not yet adopted the NovaSeq X, both on a quarter-over-quarter and a year-over-year basis. \r\nAs a reminder, we believe this data is a useful reference that shows the general activity trends across our installed base and is directionally correlated with revenue over time. \r\nSequencing instruments revenue for core Illumina of $179 million grew 10% year-over-year driven primarily by NovaSeq X, which more than offset the decline in NovaSeq 6000 shipments. Growth in high-throughput instruments was partially offset by the expected decline in mid-throughput due to increasing capital purchase and cash flow constraints that continue to impact our customers' purchasing behaviors globally as well as by local competition in China. \r\nFor NovaSeq X, we exited Q3 with more than 310 orders since launch. Our shipments of 97 NovaSeq X instruments in Q3 brought our total installed base to 273 instruments. Core Illumina sequencing service and other revenue of $142 million was up 15% year-over-year driven primarily by higher instrument service contract revenue on a growing installed base as well as an increase in lab services revenue. \r\nMoving to regional results for core Illumina. All regions continued to be impacted by 2 key issues: one, tighter funding and budget pressures that are impacting customer purchasing power and project planning; and two, the impact of high-throughput customers transitioning to NovaSeq X as customers continue to reduce NovaSeq 6000 consumables purchases before they have fully ramped up activity on NovaSeq X. \r\nAmericas revenue of $650 million grew 10% year-over-year, attributed to NovaSeq X placements as well as clinical testing volume driving greater consumables revenue. Clinical sequencing consumable shipments grew more than 20% year-over-year. \r\nEurope revenue of $260 million was flat year-over-year or up 1% on a constant currency basis. Growth in sequencing consumables was driven by mid-teens growth in clinical and strength in mid-throughput consumables, offset by the decline in COVID surveillance and the negative impact of exchange rates. \r\nFor sequencing instruments, growth in high throughput due to NovaSeq X placements was more than offset by a decline in mid-throughput instruments. EMEA revenue of $98 million declined 22% year-over-year or 19% on a constant currency basis, which included an 11 percentage point impact from sanctions in Russia. The year-over-year decrease was also driven by softness in Japan due to the macroeconomic factors I mentioned earlier as well as the expected slowdown in COVID surveillance. \r\nGreater China revenue of $98 million represented a 26% decrease year-over-year or 25% on a constant currency basis, reflecting continued macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges as well as local competition in mid-throughput. \r\nMoving to the rest of core Illumina P&L. Core Illumina non-GAAP gross margin of 66% decreased 290 basis points year-over-year primarily driven by product mix and less fixed cost leverage on lower manufacturing volumes as well as lower instrument margins and higher field service and installation costs due to the NovaSeq X launch, which is typical in a launch year. \r\nCore Illumina non-GAAP operating expenses of $481 million were down $33 million year-over-year and were lower than expected primarily due to continued expense-reduction initiatives. As a result of these factors, core Illumina non-GAAP operating margin was 22.5% in Q3 2023 compared to 22.6% in Q3 2022. Despite our lower gross margin, operating margin was approximately flat year-over-year due to our proactive cost management initiatives. \r\nTransitioning to financial results for GRAIL. GRAIL revenue of $21 million for the quarter grew 110% year-over-year driven primarily by adoption of Galleri. GRAIL non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $161 million and increased $12 million year-over-year driven primarily by efforts to scale GRAIL's commercial and R&D organizations. \r\nMoving to consolidated cash flow and balance sheet items. Cash flow provided by operations was $139 million. Third quarter 2023 capital expenditures were $45 million, and free cash flow was $94 million. We did not repurchase any common stock in the quarter. \r\nWe ended the quarter with approximately $933 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. During the third quarter of 2023, the company used $750 million in cash to repay the outstanding principal of convertible notes that matured in August 2023. \r\nMoving now to 2023 guidance. We now expect full year 2023 consolidated revenue to decline 2% to 3% from 2022, including core Illumina revenue that is down 3% to 4% year-over-year. As a reminder, these ranges include anticipated reductions from COVID surveillance of approximately 200 basis points, the impact on our business from sanctions in Russia of approximately 100 basis points, reductions in our business in China as well as a year-over-year negative impact from foreign exchange rates. \r\nGRAIL revenue is now expected to be at the low end of the range of $90 million to $110 million for 2023. \r\nFor fiscal 2023, we now expect core Illumina sequencing instrument revenue to decline 5% to 6% year-over-year driven by capital and cash flow constraints that have continued to impact our customers' purchasing behaviors globally as well as the decline in our business in China. The decrease from our prior guidance is primarily driven by our lower NovaSeq X shipment expectations for 2023. \r\nWe now expect to ship between 330 to 340 NovaSeq X instruments for the year as customers' purchasing constraints lead to lengthened sales cycles. We also now expect core Illumina sequencing consumables revenue to decline 5% to 6% year-over-year driven primarily by the decrease in NovaSeq 6000 consumables as customers transition to NovaSeq X, the impact of macroeconomic conditions on customer project planning and budgets, the effect of sanctions in Russia, the slowdown in COVID surveillance, and the decline in our business in China. The decrease from our prior guidance primarily reflects a slower ramp in NovaSeq X consumables, in part due to our lower placement expectations as well as the increasing impacts of macroeconomic constraints. \r\nWe now expect core Illumina total sequencing revenue to decline 3% to 4% year-over-year. This continues to include intercompany sales to GRAIL of approximately $30 million, which are eliminated in consolidation. We now expect consolidated non-GAAP operating margin of 4% to 4.5% and core Illumina non-GAAP operating margin of 19% to 19.5%. Our revised operating margins reflect our lower revenue expectations for the year, partially offset by continued expense-reduction initiatives. We now expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 39% for 2023 due to discrete tax benefit recognized in Q3 2023 related to prior year return adjustments. \r\nLastly, we now expect non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.60 to $0.70 for 2023, reflecting non-GAAP diluted shares outstanding of approximately 159 million shares. Dilution from GRAIL's non-GAAP operating loss is now expected to be approximately $660 million as GRAIL continues to manage its expense base in line of its latest revenue outlook. \r\nI will now turn it back over to Jacob for his closing remarks. Thank you.\n\nJacob Thaysen\n\nBefore we go to Q&A, I wanted to reiterate Illumina's commitment to supporting our customers in this difficult macroeconomic environment. While we cannot control for external factors, we can optimize our own actions to successfully navigate through this period and position the company for a return to accelerated growth on the other side. \r\nI know you're interested to hear our views for 2024. With the caveat that we haven't finished 2023, we're still looking at our budget for 2024. Our initial view is that 2024 results will look very similar to 2023. We don't expect near-term improvement to the macroeconomic environment, and geopolitical issues have been persistent. \r\nWe are encouraged with the early signs we're seeing for NovaSeq X utilization and the continued rollout of the X position us very well for the ramp in consumables and overall growth when the market conditions improve. This is clearly a dynamic situation, and we want to be able to develop our views in depth. Therefore, for 2024, we will not provide guidance before our Q4 earnings call in February. \r\nThe main reason that I joined Illumina was my strong conviction about the future of the core Illumina business. While over the coming months, I'll continue to listen and learn, I would also be focused on several key priorities. First, we need to drive our top line as much as possible in this environment. This means continued placements of the NovaSeq X and all of our instruments, laying the groundwork for increased consumables demand. \r\nWe'll continue working closely with our customers around the world, whether they are integrating new instruments into their workflows, starting new projects or building new tests or assays. \r\nSecond, we need to keep driving innovation that is highly focused on our customers with priorities. These innovations include automation and sample-to-answer solutions, served to strengthen our leadership position around the world. At the same time, we need to manage our R&D investments with discipline and rigor. \r\nWe most recently launched our 25B rating kit. This was highly anticipated by our customers, and it will unleash the full power of the NovaSeq X. \r\nThird, we need to focus our own operational excellence across geographies, functions and processes. Earlier this year, we announced a plan to reduce our annualized run rate expenses. Our team has executed well and has been able to reduce annualized run rate expenses by approximately $175 million, ahead of our original projection of more than $100 million. These savings will continue to support flexibility and further investment in high-growth areas and our margins. \r\nI'm committed to executing against all of these priorities with a strong sense of urgency. We are focused on delivering tangible improvements that support profitable long-term growth from Illumina and for our shareholders. \r\nI will now invite the operator to open for the line of Q&A.\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.\n\nVijay Muniyappa Kumar\n\nJacob, welcome to Illumina. My maybe one question is on GRAIL, maybe a 2-parter here. I think the EC divestiture order asks for 2.5 years of cash outlay. What does that mean given GRAIL's current OpEx spending? Is that $1.75 billion of cash out there. And I think related to that, I saw you announced a special committee, who is on the special committee? What is the focus for this committee? Is there any more details and it sounded something different, I just wanted to understand what is different, what has changed?\n\nJacob Thaysen\n\nYes, Vijay. Thank you very much, and I'm really excited to be here at Illumina. And let me start with your second question, and then I'll have Joydeep step in also on talking about the -- what those 2.5 years means. But as I discussed here, coming into the company, I felt it was very important to get clarity on GRAIL. And it was very important for me to have the support for the Board and to make swift decisions to move forward. \r\nAnd thereby, we started a special committee with 3 of the Board members, including -- and then besides me, that is the chairing of that committee. So I have 3 Board members plus me, that will work with the management team to really walk through all the elements around the divestiture order to make sure we can make some fast decisions. \r\nWe need to make decisions which path we're going to follow. Is it going to be a trade sale, the spin, the split, with or without a sponsor? And of course, there's a lot of considerations related to that. That's really what the special committee is helping me and the rest of the management team to do. Joydeep?\n\nJoydeep Goswami\n\nYes, Vijay. So in the 2.5 years of cash support to GRAIL, we're still working with the European Commission on exactly what that means in terms of numerical number. So I'm not at liberty to disclose those details. We will come back with that once we have alignment. \r\nBut I think as Jacob alluded to, right, this is not something that we have to provide all on our own, right? We have several options now that we have worked with the EC to come out with a -- or to have a divestiture order that is in line with our expectations for flexibility to use even in the case of a spin or a split decision, we can get in a sponsor that can support all or part of the requirement for the 2.5 years of cash support or we can go to the markets and raise that money as well, right? So stay tuned on that one.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our next question will come from Dan Brennan with TD Cowen.\n\nDaniel Gregory Brennan\n\nJacob, welcome. Maybe just -- I'll ask one. Obviously, it's all we have, but maybe a couple parter. So maybe, Jacob, obviously, you left a great job at Agilent before coming here. And certainly, would be interested to get your view on the growth rate and outlook for Illumina when you're ready to give that. But I'd be interested to get your view on kind of the overall NGS market in taking a job. Like thoughts on what type of growth characteristics you think are reasonable in that market? Because given the price cuts, there's just a lot of question on demand elasticity. \r\nSo I guess, first one is on the NGS overall market, few of view there. And then, b, I just had a question on the X specifically. I understand, obviously, has a lowering replacement number given customer constraints. But can you give any color on the orders or the backlog that you have as of right now? \r\nAnd then the final part would just be on guidance. Illumina has had a series of kind of guidance reductions. A lot of peers are facing the same issue, but you guys have had a more elongated period of this. So I'm just wondering kind of what changes can be made in order to hopefully better set guidance so that the risk of these reductions is elemented going forward.\n\nJacob Thaysen\n\nThanks, Dan. And I think I will have Joydeep also jumping in on some of those elements here. But let me just start by coming here into Illumina. And my observation both from when I was outside Illumina but also coming in, I think that the core business has a tremendous opportunity. I think there's a lot of opportunities in the NGS markets. And I think we are definitely through a tough period right now. I think the whole life science tools industry is seeing it. And certainly, here at Illumina, we're not immune for that. \r\nBut the growth rates, even though -- I will spend time here over the next period of time still learning the business and really understand the organization. So at this point of time, I don't have a final opinion about what the -- what I think is the right growth rate for the business and what we're committing to. But I will certainly come back later in '24 and share all of that with you when I'm ready for it. \r\nBut in the meantime, I think that the overall market is very healthy and there will be a lot of growth opportunities for Illumina going forward. And I can then say that my -- some of the findings coming into the company and really digging deep into our innovation engine and what our road maps look like. I'm very excited for the future of this company. I think we will continue to pioneer in this area. \r\nSo I think on guidance and, Joydeep, join in here also, but in the end, we wanted to make sure when we signal also from, especially '24 here, that at this point, we want to be prudent in how we set our -- it's not a guidance yet, but at least how we view '24 as we simply don't see any change -- short-term change in the economical environment. And therefore, we felt it was important for -- to go out now and share our observations. But Joydeep, do you want to?\n\nJoydeep Goswami\n\nNo. I think, Jacob, that's right. On the guidance piece, look, we made a commitment to you to come back to you with any read on the macroeconomics we see. And I think we've held up to that commitment. In fact, we may have been a little bit canary in the coal mine signaling some of this earlier to you, especially this year than others, right? \r\nOne of the things, of course, you did bring up was the elongated sort of lack of growth or the reduced growth that we have had. That is true. I think part of what hit us at the same time as a macroeconomic going down is the transition -- major transition on our platform, which has hit us as customers move from the 6000 to the expert. There's a gap between when they burn down some of their inventory on the X and then wait to fully ramp up on the X. So you will see that balance out over time. We don't have any doubts on that. \r\nAnd then on the X, I want to reemphasize, and I think you will have seen this from your channel checks as well, demand and interest in the innovation and the capabilities that the X brings remain strong. I think we are very excited about the launch of the 25b. And I think those of you who attended ASHG would have seen our customers interest in that and the data that's coming out of the 25B and the improvements that we continue to make on the software really resonate with our customers. So we remain very interested in that.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our next question will come from Puneet Souda with Leerink Partners.\n\nPuneet Souda\n\nJacob, good to have you on board here. So if I could ask 2-part questions just with the 25B launch, can you talk a little bit about how -- and maybe Joydeep can chime in and talk about how the transformation is going to be sort of over the next couple of months. You obviously get a price uptick with the 25B, but not all customers are going to be able to essentially fill up that flow cell. So there is going to be a bit of an ebb and flow. So maybe if you could talk a little bit about that, at least qualitatively in the near term. \r\nAnd then a bigger competition question. Jacob, you've seen the LCMS business and other businesses in China. What do you imagine for China, for Illumina with one of the bigger competitors over there? How do you see Illumina's position in China longer term? \r\nAnd if I may just ask on -- again, on competition, one of your diagnostic customers, NIPT and MRD customer pointed out that they're validating different platforms. So again, what's your view on competition?\n\nJacob Thaysen\n\nThank you very much, Puneet. And again, I'm very pleased to be here. Let me start with the China question. Yes, you're right, I have certainly some experience of running businesses in China, very familiar with the Chinese -- the China itself and how to operate businesses there.\r\nSo what is, of course, more unique for Illumina than some of our -- some of the other life science tools companies is that Illumina has a Chinese competitor that have at least good enough sequencing capabilities here. But China continues to be an extremely important country for us. And we are right now working through and -- in China for China strategy to really be much better positioned in China going forward, and we are committing to China. And I think we can actually do really well in China.\r\nMany of our customers in China prefers to work with Illumina for what we stand for both quality but also that we are the number one brand out there. So we will continue to be very strong in China.\r\nGenerally speaking, on competition, yes, you're right. I mean there are competition out there. As you also know, I'm very familiar with being in a very competitive environment. And I think that with what Illumina has, which I think will serve us extremely well, is that we have a very strong brand. We have a very strong installed base. Almost all payables coming out is based on our technology.\r\nAnd also, of course, what I see internally with the road map we have for the pipeline of new products coming out, our innovation capabilities will continue to position us very extremely competitive in this environment. But of course, I understand and I'm fully aware that we will be in a very competitive situation forward. And in the end, I think that just keeps us really focused on our customers, and we'll do our best for our customers. So I'm here, I'm ready to fight for it.\n\nJoydeep Goswami\n\nYes. Maybe I'll tag on there. Let me start with the competition. We obviously, as Jacob said, take it seriously but also monitor it very carefully across the globe through what we're seeing out in the field. So I will say, outside of China, we have seen the competition. And share have been what we had expected, right? Obviously, with new market entrants, you will see a little bit of a decline in share, but it has been, outside of China, very much according to expectations.\r\nOn the 25B, Puneet, so let me start by saying what we have seen, and this is early indicator, is that when we look at sequencing activity growth, and we measure it by gigabase, we are seeing that customers who have adopted Dx have seen a faster growth rate in output, in sequencing output than customers who have not adopted Dx, right? So this is an encouraging sign that X is actually spurring more sequencing activity at these customers.\r\nAnd again, it's still very early days. They're ramping up. They're validating fully on their particular workflows. With 25B, I think you're right, it will spur even more capacity and experiments. We've heard customers that want to run very large single-cell experiments, for example, be very excited about this 25B and the capabilities that it brings. So we expect that to play out.\r\nI think when you get into the dynamics of whether you're running full flow cells or not, there is a very complex interaction of things that will lead to higher prices per gigabase until we fully load your flow cells. So we can get into that off-line. But we do expect those dynamics to be very similar to what you saw when you brought on NovaSeq 6000 and some of the other flow cells, et cetera.\n\nJacob Thaysen\n\nBut I think also, Joydeep, just to finish on the opportunity that we have seen, at least the customers that I've met here also in the clinical space, are very excited with the new flow cells as this opens up for new assays, new products offering that they haven't had before. So while it will take them a little while, of course, to validate and get up and running, we see many of them right now are rushing to be first to market with us.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our next question will come from Dan Arias with Stifel.\n\nDaniel Anthony Arias\n\nJacob, just a follow-up on the special committee that will look at GRAIL. What's the general time line that they're expected to be on with respect to reaching a decision? And then can you update us on when the GRAIL team is expecting to see a readout for the NHS-Galleri study at this point?\n\nJacob Thaysen\n\nYes. So I can tell you that we are working as quickly as we can under the framework to look at the options here. And I can tell you the -- I'm as frustrated as all of you, and I look forward to get this behind us. So we are working on very tight time lines. At this point, I don't want to commit to anything because I want to make sure that I can deliver on my commitments on any time line here.\r\nSo by the way, I also want to share with you that this morning, we got the feedback from the ECJ that they have now put in a date for the hearing -- oral hearing, which would be mid-December. So it's good news in the way that things now are moving forward.\r\nAnd just on that, that the appeals are important to us, obviously, for the reason of GRAIL, but probably as important for ensuring that we have the flexibility for future transactions that we will look into. So -- and obviously, also, we can get rid of the fine and so on. So that's why the appeals continues to be important.\n\nJoydeep Goswami\n\nNHS GRAIL readout timing, I think as I stated before that's -- the final expectation on that is some point in 2024, and they will have an early readout as well -- a preliminary readout before that.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd we have a question from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America.\n\nMichael Leonidovich Ryskin\n\nWelcome board. I guess I want to follow up on the earlier question about sort of underlying demand in the market and what gives you confidence in some of the longer-term view. And I guess I'll phrase it in terms of your update to the guide here in the third quarter. I mean you're citing some of the same macro headwinds that others are in terms of what's going on in China, in terms of broader funding concerns and budget tightness. And you're saying that that's sort of weighing on consumables purchases.\r\nBut at the same time, you're not getting the switchover to the Nova X because if you're looking at the order book, the orders have barely grown between 2Q and 3Q. You went from 260 to 310. So orders were up 50 units in the quarter and you placed 97. So it's not like there's a ton of demand growing for Nova X, and yet the Nova 6000 consumables seems to be really slowing. \r\nSo I'm just trying to reconcile that. I mean if people aren't sequencing on the Nova 6000 because they're gearing up for the Nova X, then you would at least see those orders grow. So how can you confidently state that some of this is that transition between instruments and not just less underlying demand in the market?\n\nJacob Thaysen\n\nYes. So let me just start again, address that the -- that we do see the demand in the market space. We also mentioned this overall that we see more gigabase growth rate. So we see definitely there's a lot of activities out there. And again, there's no doubt that the long-term perspective in this market is very healthy. I think what you're seeing is that we're running through and a very challenging environment that everybody else is seeing.\r\nAnd I think everybody -- also last year when they were providing guidance, they were probably optimistic that things will spring back in the second half. And everybody got surprised or at least -- that it didn't. So therefore, we are right now a little more prudent in how we look out in the future. So I think that's one element to it. But if you look into the specifics, I think Joydeep can provide little more insights.\n\nJoydeep Goswami\n\nYes. So I think the -- there's a couple of things when we look at why is it -- further -- the slowdown is further impacted by the transition, right? So definitely, Michael, there is an element of the overall macro slowdown.\r\nBut two things I will tell you about the transition, right? So we look very carefully at high-throughput customers that have purchased the X versus those that have not purchased an X. And we see definitely that the 6000 consumables slowdown is much more pronounced to these customers that have bought the X, right? So that gives us a very good control mechanism of isolating the impact of transition versus the broader macroeconomic trends.\r\nAnd again, realize that they're still ramping up with the X and the 25B. Really for many of these customers that are early adopters, they're really the higher users -- the higher-output users for the NovaSeq X, right? So you will see that transition coming, the ramp-up on the X consumables coming, especially after the launch of the 25B. But it will take them a few months to get up to full capacity once they've validated their workflows.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our next question comes from Tejas Savant with Morgan Stanley.\n\nTejas Rajeev Savant\n\nJacob, welcome to Illumina. I had a couple of questions for you here, starting on the GRAIL side of things. Looks like you're expecting this ECJ decision in mid-'24. So can you just walk us through the implications of that in terms of what the committee can really do ahead of that time frame?\r\nAnd then beyond the ongoing sort of court cases and figuring out if it end and how to divest this asset, how are you thinking about monetizing the data value that's embedded within GRAIL? Is that an active discussion that's being had at the Board level within this committee as well?\r\nAnd the final part of my question really is a broader one on core Illumina. Where are you in terms of the key leadership roles. Are those -- do you feel like you have a settled team yet? Or could we see some sort of significant changes in the months ahead?\n\nJacob Thaysen\n\nYes. So let me start by addressing the GRAIL situation. And as I think I mentioned before, that's why I put the committee in place or special committee in place is that we have the European divestiture order. And obviously, while we still run the appeals, we will do everything within the framework to move as quickly as possible. As I also mentioned in my remarks is that as soon as we have filed the Form 10, we will go out there and start to talk to potential acquirer and so on -- also looking for the spin and so on.\r\nSo we are moving as quick as we can within that framework. And we will move -- yes, again, we will move as much as we can here. So there's really nothing that holds us back from -- the appeals really runs in parallel. So there's nothing that it prevents us from moving as quick as we can within that. So I think that's -- on that, if you look at the monetization of GRAIL, I don't know, Joydeep, do you have any, thinking about that?\n\nJoydeep Goswami\n\nI think mostly, it's -- you're talking about GRAIL data here. So this is one of the options that obviously the committee will consider and we will consider as a team. But it also really depends on the divestiture option that's chosen and what we agree going back and forth with the European Commission here. So it is one of the things that is absolutely in consideration of the various options that Jacob mentioned that the committee is going to bring on.\n\nJacob Thaysen\n\nYes. And then the last question, I think, was on the leadership team, and I will put it more broadly saying that I will be performing a comprehensive business view over the next period of time. Again, I've been here 40 days, and I'm really impressed with the team and the talented people we have in the organization. But I will, of course, keep you updated on what my thinking is, why we move forward here in '24.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd we have a question from Dan Leonard with UBS.\n\nDaniel Louis Leonard\n\nNow that you're sort of transitioning to maybe a bit more of a hand-to-mouth demand cycle for the X given that you don't have much backlog left, I was hoping you could elaborate what the pipeline looks like. Any metrics you could offer? And is it possible you could quantify how much is the sales cycle lengthening? Is it double what it used to be? Is it some different multiple? Just anything you could help us contextualize that?\n\nJacob Thaysen\n\nI think that, again, I would like to invite Joydeep in to provide a little more insights on where we are. But I can say, generally speaking, the sales cycles is extended quite a lot from what we're used to, not only because it takes time to make the decision, but also to get it through all the levels that there's much more scrutiny on all levels in the decision-making. And we've seen that. I mean we see that in Illumina, but I think that's a general thing that is happening in the industry right now. But Joydeep, do you want to...\n\nJoydeep Goswami\n\nI just want to corroborate, Jacob, what you said, right? We see strong interest in the X. And obviously, with the launch of the 25B, that has perked up even more. And the pipeline continues to have hundreds of opportunities there, right? So we're not suffering decline in the pipeline. We continue to add opportunities for the pipeline.\r\nWhat has been -- because of the macroeconomic situation is a little bit more challenging for us is converting those, that pipeline into orders as quickly as we had imagined, right? So that is the lengthening of the sales cycle that you talked about. And we expect that, that will continue for us and for others for a little bit of time into the future here, right, till macroeconomic conditions return.\r\nBut there's no doubt that they're not -- it's not that the demand is shifting to some other technology or some other instrument. It is still very much centered on the X, and we still continue to have conversations with our customers to get them there. And once they have bought it to really ramp them up and get them ramped up as quickly as possible so that they can pull through the consumables as quickly as possible.\n\nJacob Thaysen\n\nYes. And again, I mean, as Joydeep was saying, we have a healthy pipeline. And just as an evidence that this is moving, we just here -- over the last few days, we received a 10 order -- or 10 pieces -- or was it 10-instrument order on X so -- from one of our biggest customers. So we're definitely seeing that there is really customers who really like the X and can really see that it can be utilized very nicely.\n\nJoydeep Goswami\n\nYes. Jacob, that's a good point. That's a fleet expansion order. So they've had experience with the X, and they are doubling down, right, so.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd we have a question from Sung Ji Nam with Scotiabank.\n\nSung Ji Nam\n\nWelcome, to Jacob. Just a quick one on GRAIL. Kind of what's the key driver of the guidance, the updated guidance being at the low end of the prior range?\n\nJacob Thaysen\n\nJoydeep?\n\nJoydeep Goswami\n\nI can handle this. Yes, so again, it's mostly 2 things. So they did have this particular year, some challenges with their PDX revenue. This is the pharma services revenue. And then Galleri sales are -- while they're growing nicely, have been lower than their initial expectations, right? So both those have impacted it.\n\nJacob Thaysen\n\nBut still a healthy growth.\n\nJoydeep Goswami\n\nStill a very healthy growth. We're seeing that at 100%-ish.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our next question comes from Kyle Mikson with Canaccord.\n\nKyle Alexander Mikson\n\nWelcome, Jacob. Two-part question. First on GRAIL, second on core. On the GRAIL funding in conjunction with the divestiture, if it is a capital mortgage transaction, the company is going to need 2.5 years of cash. I think that was touched on earlier. You could provide that via equity raise or debt issuance. Could you just walk through what your exact options are to produce that capital if you don't do equity or debt offering?\r\nAnd then on the core business. You guys mentioned the initial view on 2024, is that -- it look similar to 2023. Does that mean that revenue is going to be flat year-over-year for the third year in a row? And then maybe you could just comment on orders and placements for next year. Like could placements grow in '24?\n\nJacob Thaysen\n\nYes. So let me start by the second question here. And again, we will come up with a full guidance in our Q4 '23 call in February. But I'm just sharing you with the initial view we have on '24 right now. And due to the macroeconomic environment, we want to -- and we don't see that change right now.\r\nIf it changes during '24, obviously, we will see more momentum in the business. But I felt it was important to share with all of you right now on how we see the year. There are more details behind it, but we're still working through the rest of this year and we're still finalizing the, of course, 2024 budget also. So it's too early for me to share details about the debt here.\r\nBut what I can tell you, as we said before, is that we still have a strong pipeline on X particularly. And we expect -- and we're just seeing that the sales cycle is taking longer than we expected. But you should actually see that the consumables is starting to pick up in '24 also.\n\nJoydeep Goswami\n\nAnd on the GRAIL, I think I've mentioned this earlier, look, there are several options now on the table that we could help pay for the 2.5 years of funding requirements, right? So for example, if we went for a spin, there are options around the sponsored spin where a sponsor could put in a fair chunk of the money on -- some or all of the money that is required for that funding.\r\nThe other one, which is more of a capital markets transaction, which is more of a split kind of option, where you could go and raise money in capital markets for GRAIL and IPO market for GRAIL. So we're looking through and working through those various options. They are, of course, dependent on specific market conditions and interest in GRAIL from private placement. So we'll keep you posted on that as we go out to the market and consider those options.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd we'll take a question from Catherine Schulte with Baird.\n\nCatherine Walden Ramsey Schulte\n\nWelcome, Jacob. I guess just on your comments on '24, when you say results might look similar to '23. In that case, I guess, how do you view core Illumina op margins? Would those also look similar to '23? Or given some of the cost reductions that you guys have talked about, do you think there's room for improvement there?\n\nJacob Thaysen\n\nYes. Thanks for that. So I think right now, that Illumina have a wonderful model, actually. I think we have really strong operating gross margins. So obviously, with growth, we can really fuel that to the bottom also. But in a flat environment and with, of course -- we are seeing that more challenges. So right now, we're expecting to be flat both on top line and on the bottom line.\n\nJoydeep Goswami\n\nYes. And I think you're right. We do expect to see an improvement in gross margins next year, obviously, with more consumables mix in there. Off the cost reductions that we have made this year, I just want to remind you that some of that -- a substantial portion of that, has already been recognized this year. So there won't be incremental to next year as we go through.\r\nAnd then offsetting those 2 positives is we do expect that the variable compensation of sort of rationalization and year-on-year comp on that will be -- will eat away into that goodness that you've had and coupled with merit increases and inflation, right? So -- and again, we did not pay executives the stock-based compensation and variable compensation this year as our performance has not been up to par. So we do expect that, that will come back into next year as we correct some of that.\n\nJacob Thaysen\n\nBut I think -- on that, I think I'm everything I see here, as I mentioned, also the gross margins are strong in the company, but there's a lot we can do to continue to improve that. So I don't see anything that is -- for me, at least coming in here, see there's any difference in the thesis about Illumina going back to what has been historical margins. And we will work on that.\r\nI think historically, we have been -- the logic has been this will come through growth. And clearly, we need growth to drive some of that. But we were also really focus on operational excellence to build that going forward.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our next question comes from Conor McNamara with RBC Capital Markets.\n\nConor Noel McNamara\n\nJacob, welcome to San Diego. If I look at kind of what you've said about 2024 from pre-pandemic levels from 2019 to 2024, that would imply an annual growth rate on the core business of about 5%, which is roughly in line with the overall life science tools market despite the fact that you guys have consistently spent about 20% of sales in R&D.\r\nSo if I'm an investor looking at Illumina, should I think of this as an EBIT margin expansion story from here where you bring R&D down in line with peers? Or do you think that you guys -- you can drive a return to growth above historic life science tools growth levels?\n\nJacob Thaysen\n\nYes, that -- I mean, again, I want to be careful on coming with too many comments right now, I'm 40 days into my work here -- to my job here. But I think I still believe that Illumina has a better growth opportunity than many of the other life science tools company. And I will come back and give you more insights when I'm ready for it in -- later in 2024. \r\nBut I don't think that Illumina is in a place where it's in the level of many of the other companies right now. But it's too early for me to give you a clear guidance. But yes, so wait and see.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our next question will come from Rachel Vatnsdal with JPMorgan.\n\nRachel Marie Vatnsdal Olson\n\nWelcome to Illumina, Jacob. So first up, I just wanted to ask on core Illumina margins, follow up on some of the earlier questions. Specifically, it looks like that implied 4Q margin step down for core Illumina. But also given the lower placement number, your mix should be more skewed towards consumables than typical in 4Q. So is there anything else that we should look at from a onetime perspective or anything else on the puts and takes on that margin implied for 4Q?\n\nJacob Thaysen\n\nJoydeep, do you want to take that?\n\nJoydeep Goswami\n\nYes. So Rachel, a couple of things, right? So we -- you will see margins and operating margins decline. We are seeing a step-down in revenue from Q3 into Q4. So that's one element of that.\r\nThe second element is gross margins are impacted for several reasons, right? One, that we do see every time you see a reduction in volume, you have less absorption of fixed cost. So you have that flowing into it. The second piece is around, yes, we are seeing some shift from instruments into consumables. But we are seeing a reduction because of the transition effects of NovaSeq 6000 consumables, which are highly profitable. And so you're seeing a little bit of margin -- gross margin decline because of that.\r\nAnd then the third is we have some components of strategic deal revenue that we have coming in, in Q4 versus Q3. And that is also pulling down our gross margin. So those 3 components are really what are impacting the gross margin component.\r\nAnd then in the operating margin side, I think we obviously are getting some of the benefits of the cost action that we saw. But we did have some movement of R&D-specific timing investments that moved from Q3 into Q4. So that is taking down our -- taking up our Q4 operating expense a little bit compared to what we had in Q3.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And that does conclude our question-and-answer session. I will now hand the call back over to Jacob Thaysen for closing remarks.\n\nJacob Thaysen\n\nThank you, everyone. As we finish the year and move into 2024, I want to reiterate the great foundation that we have here, both in the infrastructure that we have built and in the significant markets that we serve. It is clear to me that there is a tremendous opportunity to create value for our customers and our partners worldwide and, of course, for our shareholders.\r\nThank you again. We're looking forward to see you at upcoming conferences and other events. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. That does conclude today's conference. We do thank you for your participation.

Quote\n\nSequencing Instrument revenues for Core Illumina of $179 million grew 10% year over year. The increase was primarily led by strength in NovaSeq X shipments, which more than offset the decline in NovaSeq 6000 shipments.\n\nCore Illumina sequencing service and other revenues were $142 million (up 15% year over year). This was driven primarily by higher instrument service contract revenue on a growing installed base, as well as an increase in lab services revenue.\n\nGRAIL contributed $21 million to revenues during the reported quarter compared with $10 million in the year-ago period.\n\nMargins\n\nThe adjusted gross margin (excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets) was 65.3% in the reported quarter, highlighting a contraction of 310 basis points (bps) year over year. The decline is attributed to product mix and less fixed cost leverage on lower manufacturing volumes, as well as lower instrument margins and higher field service and installation costs due to the NovaSeq X launch.\n\nStory continues\n\nResearch and development expenses decreased 3.1% year over year to $315 million, whereas SG&A expenses came in at $303 million compared with $146 million in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted operating costs increased 31.2% to $618 million. The adjusted operating profit in the quarter was $113 million, down 61.3% year over year.\n\nFinancial Update\n\nIllumina exited the third quarter of 2023 with cash and cash equivalents plus short-term investments of $933 million compared with $1.56 billion at the end of the second quarter of 2023. The company did not repurchase any common stock in the quarter.\n\nCumulative net cash provided by operating activities at the end of the third quarter of 2023 was $254 million compared with $245 million in the last year\u2019s comparable period.\n\n2023 Guidance\n\nIllumina updated its 2023 outlook. The company expects 2023 consolidated revenues to decrease 2-3% (the earlier guidance was nearly 1% growth) compared with the previous year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $4.60 billion.\n\nAdjusted EPS for 2023 is expected in the range of 60 cents to 70 cents (the previous guidance was 75 cents to 90 cents). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at 78 cents.\n\nCore Illumina revenues are now expected to decrease 3-4% year over year (earlier projection was flat revenue growth). GRAIL revenues are anticipated to be at the low end of the $90 million to $110 million range (earlier projection, between $90 million-$110 million).\n\nKey Announcements\n\nThroughout the third quarter, Illumina headlined on many occasions. Notably, the company launched TruSight Oncology 500 (TSO 500) ctDNA Version 2, a liquid biopsy assay that enables comprehensive genomic profiling of circulating tumor DNA. Major improvements include a faster turnaround time of less than four days, higher sensitivity with lower input requirements and a more streamlined workflow.\n\nThe company also announced the opening of a new office and state-of-the-art Illumina Solutions Center in Bengaluru, India, to grow the genomics market in the most populous country in the world. The expansion will help unlock opportunities for advancing healthcare and combat the effects of climate change in South Asia.\n\nOur Take\n\nIllumina delivered better-than-expected third-quarter 2023 earnings, while revenues were a miss. Core Illumina\u2019s performance across all regions was affected by tighter funding and budget pressures impacting customers\u2019 purchasing power, as well as the high-throughput customers transitioning to NovaSeq X. Contraction in margins, as well as a reduced full-year outlook, is also discouraging.\n\nOn a positive note, Illumina has been executing well in its plan to reduce the analyzed run rate expenses, having reduced by approximately $175 million, which is ahead of the original projection of more than $100 million. This appears promising.\n\nZacks Rank & Key Picks\n\nIllumina currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are DexCom DXCM, Medpace MEDP and The Ensign Group ENSG.\n\nDexCom, carrying a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy), reported a third-quarter 2023 adjusted EPS of 50 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 47.1%. Revenues of $975 million outpaced the consensus mark by 4%.

(c) The year-over-year decrease in gross margin was primarily driven by less fixed cost leverage on lower manufacturing volumes, product mix, as well as lower instrument margins and higher field service and installation costs due to the NovaSeq X launch, which is typical in a launch year.\n\nGRAIL\n\nGAAP Non-GAAP (a) In millions Q3 2023 Q3 2022 Q3 2023 Q3 2022 Revenue $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 21 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 10 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 21 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 10 Gross (loss) profit $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (27) $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (32) $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1 R&D expense $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 79 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 74 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 79 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 74 SG&A expense $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 87 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 81 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 82 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 75 Goodwill and intangible impairment $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 821 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3,914 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 Operating loss $ (1,015) $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (4,101) $\u00a0\u00a0 (155) $\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (148)\n\n(a) See Table 3 included in the \"Results of Operations - Non-GAAP\" section below for reconciliations of these GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.\n\nAs previously stated, Illumina is committed to moving as quickly as possible through the legal and regulatory processes associated with its acquisition of GRAIL.

The company's financial measures under GAAP include substantial charges such as amortization of acquired intangible assets among others that are listed in the itemized reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release, as well as the effects of currency translation. Management has excluded the effects of these items in non-GAAP measures to assist investors in analyzing and assessing past and future operating performance, including in the non-GAAP measures related to our Core Illumina and GRAIL segments. Additionally, non-GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share are key components of the financial metrics utilized by the company's board of directors to measure, in part, management's performance and determine significant elements of management's compensation.\n\nThe company encourages investors to carefully consider its results under GAAP, as well as its supplemental non-GAAP information and the reconciliation between these presentations, to more fully understand its business. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP results are presented in the tables of this release.\n\nUse of forward-looking statements\n\nThis release may contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

As a result, certain amounts may not recalculate using the rounded amounts provided. (a) Non-GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share exclude the effects of the pro forma adjustments as detailed above. Non-GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share are key components of the financial metrics utilized by the company's board of directors to measure, in part, management's performance and determine significant elements of management's compensation. Management has excluded the effects of these items in these measures to assist investors in analyzing and assessing our past and future operating performance. (b) Refer to the Itemized Reconciliations between GAAP and Non-GAAP Results of Operations for the components of these amounts. (c) Amounts represent the impact of GRAIL pre-acquisition net operating losses on GILTI and the utilization of U.S. foreign tax credits. (d) Incremental non-GAAP tax expense reflects the tax impact of the non-GAAP adjustments listed. (e) Amounts represent the difference between book and tax accounting related to stock-based compensation cost. (f) In loss periods, GAAP basic loss per share and diluted loss per share are identical since the effect of potentially dilutive shares is anti-dilutive and therefore excluded. For non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, the impact of potentially dilutive shares from our convertible senior notes and equity awards is included and is calculated based on the sum of weighted-average common shares and potentially dilutive shares outstanding during Q3 2022 and YTD 2022. (g) Amount represents interest expense on the 2023 Convertible Senior Notes, net of any income tax effects, which is added back to the numerator used to calculate non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, for purposes of the if-converted method, as it would have a dilutive effect on the calculation of non-GAAP diluted earnings per share.\n\nIllumina, Inc.\n\nResults of Operations - Non-GAAP

But unfortunately, some companies simply don't succeed. For example the Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) share price dropped 64% over five years. That's an unpleasant experience for long term holders. And some of the more recent buyers are probably worried, too, with the stock falling 49% in the last year. Furthermore, it's down 40% in about a quarter. That's not much fun for holders.\n\nThe recent uptick of 3.8% could be a positive sign of things to come, so let's take a look at historical fundamentals.\n\nView our latest analysis for Illumina\n\nIllumina wasn't profitable in the last twelve months, it is unlikely we'll see a strong correlation between its share price and its earnings per share (EPS). Arguably revenue is our next best option. Generally speaking, companies without profits are expected to grow revenue every year, and at a good clip. That's because it's hard to be confident a company will be sustainable if revenue growth is negligible, and it never makes a profit.\n\nIn the last half decade, Illumina saw its revenue increase by 8.8% per year. That's a pretty good rate for a long time period. The share price return isn't so respectable with an annual loss of 10% over the period. It seems probably that the business has failed to live up to initial expectations. That could lead to an opportunity if the company is going to become profitable sooner rather than later.\n\nYou can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image). earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nIllumina is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. If you are thinking of buying or selling Illumina stock, you should check out this freereport showing analyst consensus estimates for future profits.\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nIllumina shareholders are down 49% for the year, but the market itself is up 17%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 10% over the last half decade. We realise that Baron Rothschild has said investors should \"buy when there is blood on the streets\", but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining SomaLogic's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. I'm pleased to report another solid quarter marked by consistent progress on our commercial initiatives and increased operational rigor throughout the organization. \r\nDespite a challenging macroeconomic environment, we achieved third quarter revenue of $22 million, reflecting 14% year-over-year growth when excluding nonrecurring licensing revenue that we received in the third quarter of last year. Given our progress, we are raising our full year 2023 revenue expectations to $82 million to $85 million from the prior range of $80 million to $84 million. \r\nBefore turning to our results in more detail, I'd like to highlight our recent merger announcement. In early October, following a comprehensive review of strategic options, we announced our intention to combine in an all-stock merger with Standard BioTools, a leading provider of mass cytometry and microfluidic technologies. The merger establishes a leading platform of multi-omic technologies to power research insights across a broad and growing market while expediting SomaLogic's path to scale and cash flow breakeven. \r\nIt expands our commercial reach with cross-selling opportunities and complementary offerings. We believe the combined business will be positioned to meaningfully accelerate our path to probability, and we continue to expect the merger to close in the first quarter of 2024. We expect our proxy to be on file shortly, which will provide additional background and details regarding the transaction. \r\nNow shifting to our third quarter results, starting with our core SomaScan services offering. Customer retention and acquisition remain the focus of our commercial efforts, and we are finding new ways to validate the therapeutic pipelines of our customers. For example, the recent rise in GLP-1 agonists have increased interest in the use of SomaScan to identify early indications of efficacy across clinical trial candidates. \r\nIn a recent paper published by Diabetes Care, investigators were able to identify meaningful changes in cardiovascular risk, glucose tolerance, liver fat, body fat and cardiopulmonary fitness as a result of weight loss intervention by utilizing the SomaScan platform. By attaining an early read on efficacy, pharma investigators can allocate resources to the most promising therapeutic candidates before expensive and time-consuming longitudinal studies are undertaken. This represents just one of the many promises of the SomaScan platform. \r\nIn the third quarter, we continued to execute on our authorized site strategy. The primary goal of this strategy is to expand the ways in which customers can adopt and utilize SomaScan. We've been especially focused on expansion in Europe and Asia Pacific, as it is often more difficult for customers in those regions to send samples into our world-class services lab in Boulder, Colorado. As we establish more sites and generate higher sample volumes, we expect our authorized sites to offer more predictable and higher-margin revenue while reducing sample delivery times for researchers globally. \r\nIn March, we shared that we had established 8 distinct authorized sites, and we committed to doubling that base by year-end. As of today, we have 14 sites up and running, and we remain on track to meet our commitment. \r\nTurning to progress with Illumina. In the third quarter, we also advanced our effort to grow our distributed business through our partnership with Illumina. The partnership is focused on delivering a co-exclusive, co-branded NGS-based distributed solution. \r\nOur work remains on track, and we continue to expect early access for customers in Q1 of 2024. This joint proteomics product will combine Illumina's market-leading installed base and commercial force with the breadth and depth of the SomaScan assay to deliver differentiated insights to researchers across a wide range of customer segments. \r\nWhile attending the American Society of Human Genetics meeting in Washington, D.C. last week, I had the opportunity to speak to a number of prospective customers who are really excited about being able to leverage their Illumina NGS instrumentation to gain deeper proteomic insights in their research. The energy around this effort is palpable, and the level of interest from customers is high. \r\nFinally, we are incredibly excited to announce the commercial launch of the 11K SomaScan assay. The new high-plex platform provides 11,000 total protein measurements and is the largest proteomics offering available on the market. We now have the ability to measure more than half of the human proteome in a single assay. \r\nFollowing the 7K SomaScan offering, our prior core technology, the 11K SomaScan platform is expected to give researchers a considerable edge in the discovery of biomarkers and drug targets for translational medicine. Proteins make up more than 90% of all known drug targets. And having a broader view of the human proteome provided by this expanded platform gives our customers more opportunities to make unique and novel biological discoveries. \r\nThe aptamer-based platform retains the previous version's low coefficient of variation, which is the standard measure of reproducibility versus the 10% to 20% in antibody-based platforms. This improves accuracy with fewer, smaller samples, which is often critical in population studies with limited sample volumes. \r\nAs early innovators in this space, we know that the discovery and development of disruptive therapeutics benefit substantially from a more complete view of the proteome. We look forward to driving adoption of this platform for the benefit of researchers across our customer base. \r\nNow before I turn the call over to Eliot Lurier, our Interim Chief Financial Officer, I'd like to reiterate that we are making strong progress towards our business objectives. And we remain excited for our future as part of the combined company with Standard BioTools. We look forward to the close of our merger and the realization of shareholder value that we can unlock together. \r\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Eliot Lurier, our Interim Chief Financial Officer, to review our financials.\n\nEliot M. Lurier\n\nThank you, Adam. Revenue for the 3 months ended September 30, 2023, was $22 million as compared to $41.7 million in the third quarter of 2022, a 47% year-over-year decline on a GAAP basis. Excluding $22.3 million in royalty revenue in the third quarter of 2022 from NEB, our revenue increased by 14% year-on-year. \r\nOur underlying third quarter performance was driven by increasing adoption of the SomaScan platform as well as an increase in revenue through our authorized sites. Product revenue associated with our authorized site strategy was up close to $2.5 million versus Q3 '22 and up $0.5 million or 17% sequentially from Q2 of this year. \r\nGross margin for the third quarter of 2023 was 47.2%, a decrease from 72% in the prior year period. Excluding the NEB royalty revenue in the third quarter of 2022, gross margin increased by 7.4% year-on-year. As we noted earlier in the year, we continue to expect full year 2023 gross margins in the mid-40% range and expect our margin profile to improve long term from our combined distributed solution and future royalty revenues. \r\nTotal operating expenses for the third quarter of 2023 were $38.5 million, a 46% decrease from $70.7 million in the third quarter of 2022. R&D expenses for the third quarter of 2023 were $10.5 million compared to $19.4 million in the third quarter of 2022. \r\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the third quarter of 2023 were $23.9 million compared to $49.5 million in the third quarter of 2022. Transaction expenses for the third quarter of '23 were $4.2 million compared to (inaudible) in the third quarter of 2022. Transaction costs in third quarter are related to our upcoming (technical difficulty) Q3 '22 were related to the (inaudible). \r\nLastly, I would like to note the prior year's operating expenses include (technical difficulty). Our third quarter results reflect substantial progress across ongoing expense reduction initiatives. We remain on track to recognize approximately $170 million in full year operating expenses. \r\nAdjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2023 was a loss of $20.1 million compared to an adjusted EBITDA loss of $30.2 million in the third quarter of 2022. Accounting for the NEB royalty in Q3 '22, the adjusted EBITDA would have been a loss of $52.5 million. \r\nWe ended the third quarter with $454 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Our cash burn in the quarter was $20 million, reflecting a significantly sequential decrease as we implement greater spending control. \r\nWe anticipate ending the year with approximately $430 million in cash, equivalents and short-term investments, implying a significantly lower cash burn rate than we had originally guided for the year. Ending with our full year outlook, as Adam mentioned, we are raising our 2023 revenue guidance to $82 million to $85 million. \r\nAt this point, I'd like to turn the call back to Adam.\n\nAdam Taich\n\nThanks, Eliot. In a moment, I will turn the line over to our operator, Shannon, to open up the queue for questions. Before I do, I would like to ask that our audience to focus our questions on our third quarter business results and progress rather than on the announced merger with Standard BioTools as our proxy statement has not yet been filed. \r\nShannon, we're now ready for questions.\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Kyle Mikson with Canaccord Genuity.\n\nKyle Alexander Mikson\n\nSo looking at the enhanced (inaudible) library, I was just curious sort of new indications that you've seen (inaudible). I know it's, obviously, very early days. And I guess more so (inaudible).\n\nAdam Taich\n\nShannon, I think as you just saw from the -- Eliot and I are unable to -- we weren't able to hear the question.\n\nEliot M. Lurier\n\nWe're hearing a lot of background static.\n\nOperator\n\nKyle, could you please repeat your question?\n\nKyle Alexander Mikson\n\nYes. So (inaudible). So regarding the enhanced protein library, I was just curious what new indications that you're seeing researchers use the library for? I know it's early days, but just kind of curious kind of where -- what type of research to (inaudible)?\n\nAdam Taich\n\nYes. (inaudible) But we also wanted to ensure that we were looking on (inaudible) in the areas of scientific interest (inaudible) gathering proteins with new menu. I hope that's audible. And I'll defer that, Shannon, to you.\n\nKyle Alexander Mikson\n\nGot it. I could definitely hear you loud and clear. And then my other question just would be I guess looking at the performance, would you say that this (inaudible). Would you say some of this performance is driven more so the (inaudible) research or like on the biopharma?\n\nAdam Taich\n\nYes. I would say most of the -- we're seeing fantastic growth in both customer segments, but we're really starting to accelerate and penetrate more deeply in the biopharma. Those, as I've discussed earlier, can oftentimes (inaudible) along the road, and then you'll see those customer bases. And we're starting to see more and more growth different therapeutic areas (inaudible) discovery aspect all the way (inaudible) highlighted on GLP-1 in our comments. We're finding ourselves also in those clinical discussions as well.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is coming from the line of Dan Brennan with TD Cowen.\n\nKyle Boucher\n\nIt's Kyle on for Dan. I had one on the kits business in regards to the authorized sites. You said you're up to 14 sites. How is the activity level with each of those sites? And do you have plans to expand this in '24?\n\nAdam Taich\n\nYes. So (inaudible) some of those new sites that we've gotten up and running, but (inaudible) one of the things we've tried to do over the last several quarters is selecting great partner. And we've done so thus far. So activity level is great and (inaudible).\n\nKyle Boucher\n\nGot it. And how should we sort of think about the Q-over-Q growth in the kits business? It picked up sequentially. And I think you guys beat the quarter by about $1.5 million relative to The Street and raised the midpoint of the guide. Should we just carry the speed sort of over in Q4? The Street numbers look relatively fine where they are. How should we think about that?\n\nAdam Taich\n\nI apologize. Can you repeat the question?\n\nKyle Boucher\n\nYes, we might be having some technical difficulties here. So you beat the quarter by about $1.5 million rate at the midpoint of the guide, about $1.5 million. Are you comfortable where The Street is for the fourth quarter? Or I guess what are sort of the puts and takes of 4Q?\n\nAdam Taich\n\nYes. I think part of the reason that we increased guidance is we're expecting the fourth quarter to look more similar to the third quarter. And so we're feeling good about that. Our business (inaudible).\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Arias with Stifel.\n\nUnidentified Analyst\n\nIt's Paul on for Dan. Apologies if this has been asked. I'm having trouble hearing, but I think the audio (inaudible). Just wondering in terms of setting up these authorized sites, now that you're up to 14 becoming, I guess, a little more frequent. Can you talk about -- are you starting to see any improvement in terms of faster pace of training or customers staying up to speed and sort of in terms of the normalized pull-through. Is that kind of something that you're seeing as more and more authorized sites are getting out there? Or is it just more status quo as new customers (inaudible)?\n\nAdam Taich\n\nNo, I think (inaudible) as we learn (inaudible). We continue to increase in the site (inaudible).\n\nUnidentified Analyst\n\nOkay. Great. And then the last one is in terms of the guidance raise, is that something that -- is there a specific geography that's contributed more so to that? Or you're seeing more strength than you expected a quarter ago or is that relatively broad-based?\n\nAdam Taich\n\nIt's fairly broad based, to be honest with you. It isn't any ERP. In particular, I think (inaudible) so what we're seeing is really more broad-based growth as we extend our (inaudible) in Europe historically, we're seeing really nice uptick in (inaudible).\n\nOperator\n\nI would now like to turn the call back over to Adam Taich for closing remarks.\n\nAdam Taich\n\nGreat. Thanks, Shannon. And apologies for a little bit of technical difficulty right at the Q&A. I hope it's audible. I just really want to thank you for your time and your efforts to join this call. And we look forward to another strong quarter and closing the merger with Standard BioTools. Thank you so much.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

No matter the market conditions, they seem able to find the silver lining. There are very few \u201csell\u201d recommendations, with most stock endorsements being a \u201cbuy\u201d or \u201cstrong buy.\u201d Yet maybe they\u2019re seeing something through those rose-colored glasses they wear.\n\nNasdaq 100 stocks are down 4% from recent highs in July but was technically in a correction toward the end of October. The tech-heavy index recently jumped higher on news from the Federal Reserve regarding interest rates, so there is good reason to see the positive side of things.\n\nHistory suggests that a bull market eventually erases every double-digit decline in the stock market. Also, we measure bear markets in months while bull markets are measured in years. So analysts have good reason to see the bright side of Nasdaq 100 stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNaturally, exuberance can be taken to an extreme. Sometimes caution is warranted. What follows are seven Nasdaq 100 stocks that Wall Street believes can soar as much as 367%!\n\nSirius XM Holdings (SIRI) Person holding mobile phone with logo of US broadcasting company Sirius XM Holdings Inc. (SIRI) on screen in front of web page. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSatellite radio operator Sirius XM Holdings (NASDAQ:SIRI) has not been kind to investors since the turn of the century. Shares occasionally spike higher, only to give up all the gains and then some.\n\nWe saw that this past July when they suddenly surged 40% higher in one day on a short squeeze play only to plunge lower immediately afterward.\n\nAt $4.71 per share as of this writing, Sirius stock is down 41% from that peak. That hasn\u2019t stopped analysts from expecting good things still from the satellite radio star. The consensus estimate for Sirius is $7 per share, which implies a possible 50% return over the next year. On the high side, one analyst pegs it as an $8 stock, or nearly double where it sits today.\n\nWhile advertisers have been cautious, business is coming back. Sirius already booked more advertising in the first three quarters of 2023 than it did for all of 2022. Subscriptions grew to 34 million at the end of September while customer churn remains very low at 1.6%.\n\nStory continues\n\nSirius is also expanding the availability of its 360L audio platform by making it available to more OEM vehicle manufacturers.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the rumored merger with Liberty Media (NASDAQ:LSXMA)(NASDAQ:LSXMB)(NASDAQ:LSXMK) which already owns 83% of the company. There is uncertainty still about the combination, but it would bring Sirius fully under its corporate umbrella. The Liberty tracking stocks for Sirius would be combined with the satellite radio operator and then spun off into a new company.\n\nComplexity always creates doubt, but a successful merger and its turnaround plan gaining traction could allow Sirius XM Holdings to soar, which is why it\u2019s one of the Nasdaq 100 stocks to buy now.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) Walgreens (WBA) store exterior and sign in Pompano Beach, Florida\n\nSource: saaton / Shutterstock.com\n\nAiling pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) has also been on a long slide lower. Not just this year, but over at least the last decade.\n\nIt lost two-thirds of its value over that time but is down 50% from its recent 52-week high. There are a lot of reasons behind Walgreens\u2019 slow death spiral, but the current slump surrounds the pharmacy\u2019s decision not to sell its U.K. operations or its beauty care business.\n\nIt encouraged investors that Walgreens intended to focus on its domestic healthcare business. However, when the pharmacy reversed course and said it would not sell the Boots chain or No7 Beauty, they sold off the stock.\n\nYet keeping its eye on the U.S. healthcare market remains a priority for Walgreens. It owns almost two-thirds of Village MD, expanding its reach into primary, specialty care, and urgent care. And in January Village MD bought Summit Health, which owns CityMD. The $9 billion deal created one of the largest independent provider groups in the country.\n\nThat could be why analysts see Walgreens Boots Alliance having 96% upside. Even if it doesn\u2019t get that high, the pharmacy\u2019s 9.2% dividend yield buoys investor portfolios. Walgreens is the highest-yield Dividend Aristocrat and one of the Nasdaq 100 stocks worth holding onto while waiting for the turnaround to materialize.\n\nIllumina (ILMN) Illumina (ILMN) logo displayed on reddish stone facade building against blue sky background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/JHVEPhoto\n\nGenetic testing outfit Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN) was something of a market darling ever since its IPO in 2000. The sheen wore off in 2021, however, after Illumina defiantly acquired cancer test maker Grail for $7.1 billion despite regulatory objections.\n\nThe case is ongoing as Illumina challenges the European Union\u2019s demand it divest Grail, but its CEO also subsequently resigned and the board faces a proxy fight and lawsuit from billionaire investor Carl Icahn.\n\nWith all those clouds hanging over Illumina\u2019s head, it\u2019s surprising analysts have a $259 per share price target on the stock. That suggests the genetic testing company could see shares surge 130% over the next year.\n\nIllumina has a new management team and plenty of money to pay the $453 million in fines the EU proposes. It is planning to launch a new flow cell for its latest gene sequencing machine. The NovaSeqX is off to a strong start with 10% penetration across its 1,000 or so existing customers.\n\nIt is also introducing two new sequencing kits usable with existing hardware. Although China has seen slower than expected growth, Illumina is also entering the India market where there is significant growth potential.\n\nIt won\u2019t be a quick rebound, but the worst could be behind the genetic testing company. Illumina may just be able to achieve Wall Street\u2019s goals.\n\nModerna (MRNA) Moderna logo is seen at the entrance to its headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Moderna, Inc., (MRNA) is an American pharmaceutical and biotechnology company.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvestors might be surprised to see Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) shares fell 55% from recent highs. But Wall Street is convinced the biotech can recover the luster it held during the Covid pandemic. Analysts have a $222 per share one-year price target on the stock, indicating they think it can more than triple in value.\n\nIt looks like another tough slog. In financial results just published, Moderna posted a quarterly loss of $3.63 billion, or $9.53 per share. Half of that was from trashing expiring unused Covid-19 shots. It\u2019s also scaling back vaccine manufacturing. People don\u2019t feel the same need to vaccinate or get boosters as they did during the pandemic.\n\nHowever, the biotech said it expects to launch a vaccine in the U.S. next year to protect against respiratory syncytial virus. It is one of the key products Moderna is developing to jumpstart sales next year. That will put it in competition against GSK (NYSE:GSK) and Pfizer (NYSE:PFE). However, its RSV vaccine is 82.4% effective against the disease while Pfizer\u2019s fell to 78.6% and GSK\u2019s slipped to 84.6% from 94%.\n\nAs low as Moderna has fallen, investors might be just as surprised as it rebounds on better performances.\n\nJD.com (JD) JD.com (JD) logo displayed at the entrance to the company's Silicon Valley office.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nChinese online marketplace JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) still suffers from the crackdown Beijing launched into tech stocks. While those investigations are winding down, China\u2019s economy is slowing.\n\nThere is also significant geopolitical turmoil weighing on the stock, particularly as the U.S. and China spar over trade, Taiwan, and more recently, the Middle East.\n\nChina is no longer seen overtaking. Economists see China\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) slowing to 3.5% growth in 2030 and to 1% by 2050. Still, China is massive and its people want to spend. JD.com hosts the Chinese midyear shopping spectacle known as 618 (June 18).\n\nFirst launched in 2004 to celebrate the retailer\u2019s founding, this year\u2019s extravaganza ran for several weeks through mid-June. JD didn\u2019t pin a dollar figure on sales, but did say it was a record.\n\nWall Street is looking for JD\u2019s stock to soar to around $85 a share, a 214% increase from where it trades today. While the stock is down 60% from its January peak, making up a lot of the lost ground seems possible\n\nEnphase Energy (ENPH) mobile phone screen with Enphase Energy (ENPH) logo on it to represent renewable energy stocks\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt\u2019s been a long road lower for residential solar inverter leader Enphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH). The solar market is cyclical at best, and Enphase looks like it\u2019s in one of the downward swings.\n\nShares are off 77% from its 52-week high. The good news is Wall Street thinks it can shine again very soon. Analysts set a $316 price target on the stock, or 300% above its current level.\n\nEnphase is one of just two dominant manufacturers of residential inverters and has a 50% share of the market. SolarEdge Technologies (NASDAQ:SEDG) is second with a 40% share and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is a distant third at 5%. Inverters convert the direct current (DC) produced by solar panels into the alternating current (AC) used in homes.\n\nAfter a difficult 2022, the U.S. solar industry is expected to rebound this year. Analysts forecast a record 32 gigawatts of production capacity will be added in 2023. They estimate operating capacity to grow from 153 GW today to 375 GW by 2028 as Covid-era supply constraints fade.\n\nThat bodes well for Enphase, but persistent inflation and high interest rates conspire against consumers adopting solar. Solar energy systems cost a lot of money, and financing them become uneconomical in the current environment.\n\nDespite that, Enphase is holding the line on pricing. It\u2019s why the inverter leader says it is maintaining margin guidance north of 40%. It\u2019s a plan with short-term pain, but possible long-term gain.\n\nAs it expands internationally gives it greater reach and softens the blow of any regional weakness. It might get uglier before it looks better, but investors should have a long-term outlook anyway.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a LONG position in WBA stock.

Giving the proper treatment to the right patient at the right time is the goal of precision medicine.\n\nAccording to Straits Research, \u201cNorth America is dominating the market with the highest revenue and is expected to reach USD 97.32 billion in 2030, growing at a CAGR of 9.7% during the forecast period,\u201d\n\nDownload Free Sample Report PDF @ https://straitsresearch.com/report/precision-medicine-market/request-sample\n\nKey Drivers\n\nDNA sequencing technology has undergone significant technological advancements, which have paved the way for a deeper understanding of some diseases like cancer. Depending on the genetic profiles of those individuals, the advancements have made it possible to develop treatments that are better suited to them. Patients with breast, lung, or colorectal cancer who have undergone genetic testing as part of routine patient care can measure this molecular transformation of medicine. As a result, the process's accuracy and the time required to finish it have increased. With the collection of more medical data, there has been an increase in understanding of how the treatment a patient receives affects the patient's overall health. It is possible to use precision medicine for preventive care when interventions target disease risk factors to lower the disease risk. One example of this would be the treatment of high blood pressure to prevent patients from experiencing heart attacks or strokes.\n\nGrowth Opportunities\n\nMost precision medicine providers focus on developed markets, leaving emerging markets untapped. Large populations at risk for diseases requiring gene sequencing in China, India, Australia, the Middle East, and Africa present an opportunity to expand the precision medicine market. Genetics and precision medicine have made significant progress in developing countries over the past decade regarding regulations, product approvals, and implementation of novel methods and procedures in healthcare.\n\nSearching for mendelian germline genetic mutations, such as those in cancer genetics, is likely the first step for emerging nations' public healthcare systems. Private healthcare investment funds help small innovative players develop new genetic tests in emerging regions. Developing nations' proper and uncomplicated approval of GINA helped ban genetic discrimination in health insurance and employment. This creates a modern and humanized genomic medicine environment in the country.\n\nRegional Analysis\n\nThe North American segment dominates the market with the highest revenue, and The United States dominates North America's precision medicine market. Advanced research and development in molecular diagnostics and targeted therapeutics have significantly aided our understanding of the biology of various infectious diseases and forms of cancer, such as lung cancer, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer.\n\nSeveral well-established diagnostics manufacturers in North America are focusing on expanding their portfolios of NGS-based molecular diagnostics and collaborating with service providers and pharmaceutical behemoths to co-market molecular diagnostics solutions alongside their complementary precision medicine solutions. In addition, the U.S. government finances new molecular diagnostics and precision medicine start-ups.\n\nKey Highlights\n\nThe global precision medicine market size is projected to reach USD 280.67 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 11.12% during the forecast period (2022\u20132030).Based on the ecosystem, the global precision medicine market is segmented into sciences, precision diagnostics, precision therapeutics, and digital health and information technology.
