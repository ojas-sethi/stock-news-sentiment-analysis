(Photo: Joramco)\n\nBoeing is establishing its eighth production line for converting Boeing 737-800 passenger aircraft to freighters after agreeing with Amman, Jordan-based maintenance and repair company Joramco to carry out the aftermarket work.\n\nJoramco, a subsidiary of service company Dubai Aerospace Enterprise, is the first site in the Middle East to support Boeing\u2019s 737-800 conversion program. It will reconfigure used aircraft for customers in the Middle East, Europe, North Africa and the Commonwealth of Independent States. Dubai Aerospace Enterprise has a leasing company with 550 aircraft, including 140 of the 737 family. Tuesday\u2019s announcement suggested that DAE Capital would utilize Joramco to overhaul some of its own 737s for dedicated cargo business.\n\nJoramco has expanded to occupy five hangars with 22 maintenance lines by the end of 2024.\n\n\u201cWe continue to look for opportunities to bring freighter conversion capacity closer to our customers,\u201d said Mike Doellefeld, Boeing\u2019s vice president of engineering services, converted freighters and subcomponents, in the news release.\n\nBoeing did not provide details about the Joramco supplier relationship, such as when the new production line will be ready to begin work and any initial orders that will be sent to Amman. It typically takes more than a year for Boeing (NYSE: BA) partners to set up a hangar for conversion, acquire the necessary technology and tooling, and train staff.\n\nThe expansion of Boeing\u2019s conversion program comes in the middle of a serious downturn in air cargo volumes that has resulted in a sharp reduction in orders for converted freighters by lessors and all-cargo operators. During the pandemic, when air cargo capacity was at a premium, passenger-to-freighter conversions were the rage. Rising values of narrowbody aircraft at a time when manufacturers are having difficulty meeting commitments for factory-built planes is also discouraging investment in conversions.\n\nBut Boeing\u2019s outlook sees a need for 1,300 standard-size freighter conversions, such as the 737-800 and Airbus A321, by 2040. Boeing has delivered more than 130 converted 737-800s, with a backlog of 120 orders and commitments. In March, Boeing announced plans to activate a 737-800 production line in India.\n\nStory continues\n\nBoeing 737-800 BCF (Boeing Converted Freighter) at SJO/Juan Santamaria Int\u2019l Airport.\r\nCosta Rica is a beautiful country pic.twitter.com/PqSLEr9IDp\n\n\u2014 #cockpitview (@lonlowe) August 22, 2023\n\nCooperativa Autogestionaria de Servicios Aeroindustriales, a licensed partner in Costa Rica that installed its first conversion kit in January, recently completed a modification for WestJet Cargo, according to a post on social media showing the finished plane at the San Juan airport. WestJet, whic started its freighter airline earlier this year with three leased aircraft, confirmed on LinkedIn on Thursday that the cargo jet has joined its fleet. The fourth 737-800 took longer to convert because it was a WestJet passenger aircraft that required different modifications than the other aircraft.\n\nClick here for more FreightWaves stories by Eric Kulisch.\n\nContact reporter: ekulisch@freightwaves.com\n\nRECOMMENDED READING:\n\nBoeing adds 737-800 conversion line in India\n\nThe post Boeing adds Middle East site for 737-800 cargo conversions appeared first on FreightWaves.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/boeing-adds-middle-east-737-182423129.html", "symbols": ["BA.MX", "BA.US", "BCO.F", "BCO.XETRA", "BOEI34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.938, "neg": 0.019, "neu": 0.929, "pos": 0.052}}, {"date": "2023-08-24T17:19:04+00:00", "title": "Markets Fall Midday as Tech Rally Fades Ahead of Speech by Fed Chair Powell", "content": "U.S. equity markets fell in midday trading on Thursday, Aug. 24, 2023, as tech gains following Nvidia's earnings beat faded ahead of Fed Chair Jerome Powell's coming speech at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium.\n\nContinue reading", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/m/2909174d-22f5-3b74-98ec-aebf23307412/markets-fall-midday-as-tech.html", "symbols": ["A1MD34.SA", "AMD.F", "AMD.MX", "AMD.US", "AMD.XETRA", "BA.MX", "BA.US", "BCO.F", "BCO.XETRA", "BOEI34.SA", "GSPC.INDX", "NVD.F", "NVD.XETRA", "NVDA.MX", "NVDA.US", "NVDC34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.34, "neg": 0, "neu": 0.936, "pos": 0.064}}, {"date": "2023-08-24T17:03:00+00:00", "title": "Here Are the 2 Stocks Overshadowing Nvidia's Big News", "content": "Investors interested in artificial intelligence got the news they wanted, as Nvidia continued to show dominating performance in the tech sector.

To expand its 787 Dreamliner family jet, Qantas is looking to add four more 787-9 and eight 787-10 airplanes to its already existing portfolio of 14 787-9 jets.\n\nBoeing\u2019s 787 Dreamliner family of jets can fly with sustainable aviation fuel,\u00a0and eco-friendly GE engines will assist Qantas in taking a step forward in its sustainability goals and reducing emissions by up to 25%. These jets are capable of flying a longer distance non-stop and provide Qantas with the benefits of adding new routes to its network and using less fuel.\n\nWhat\u2019s Favoring Boeing?\n\nBoeing\u2019s latest Commercial Market Outlook projects the demand for 42,000 new commercial airplanes for the next 20 years. The report further suggests passenger traffic to continue to show strength. This reflects bright growth prospects for commercial aerospace players like Boeing.\n\nIt remains the largest aircraft manufacturer in the United States in terms of revenues, orders and deliveries. The strong demand for its commercial planes can be gauged by revenues in the Commercial segment, which increased 41% year over year, mainly driven by higher 787 deliveries.\n\nBoeing delivered 136 commercial planes during the last reported quarter, thus recording growth of 12% year over year. The backlog for its Commercial segment remained healthy, with more than 4,800 airplanes valued at $363 billion.\n\nSuch an impressive order backlog assures strength in the performance of the top line of the company, thus boosting its overall returns.\n\nPeer Prospects\n\nApart from Boeing, aircraft manufacturers in the industry that have an established position in the aircraft manufacturing market and may gain from the flourishing demand are as follows:\n\nAirbus EADSY enjoys strong demand in the commercial aircraft segment. EADSY delivered 189 commercial aircraft in the second quarter, thus registering growth of 21.9% year over year.EADSY expects to deliver 720 commercial aircraft in 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe long-term (three to five years) earnings growth of EADSY stands at 12.4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 sales calls for a growth rate of 17.8%.\n\nEmbraer ERJ continues to witness the strong market demand for its E-jets worldwide. ERJ delivered 17 commercial jets in the second quarter compared with seven in the prior quarter. ERJ\u2019s commercial jet deliveries are projected in the band of 65-70 jets, while Executive Aviation deliveries are expected in the band of 120-130 aircraft.\n\nEmbraer\u2019s long-term earnings growth rate is 17%. ERJ shares have returned 42.5% in the past year.\n\nPrice Performance\n\nShares of Boeing have rallied 39.7% in the past year against the industry\u2019s fall of 7%.

The latest quality issue is due to improperly shaped holes in the aft pressure bulkhead of some planes.\n\nThe bulkhead is a structure that seals off the rear of the pressurized cabin. The parts in question were made by Spirit, whose shares were down 6.4% in premarket trading on Thursday.\n\nBut not all 737 fuselages will be impacted as Spirit uses multiple suppliers for the aft pressure bulkhead.\n\nBoeing believes the defect is limited to a portion of its bestselling MAX 8 model, but was evaluating if older-model 737 Next Generation jets have also been impacted.\n\n\"It is early days on both the near and long-term financial impacts of the issue, but it appears the fix is likely to take several weeks for completed aircraft,\" Citi analyst Jason Gursky said in a note.\n\nThe planemaker's ratio of enterprise value to sales for the next 12 months is 2, compared to 1.3 for rival Airbus, as per Refinitiv data.

This will expand Embraer\u2019s presence in the Chinese aviation market, thus potentially leading to increased sales from China in the days ahead.\n\nEmbraer\u2019s\u00a0Prospects in China\n\nChina is poised to show rising domestic demand for traveling, which is likely to boost the growth of the civil aviation market. Per the CAAC, China\u2019s domestic passenger traffic volume recorded growth of a whopping 135% to reach 224.8 million year to date compared to the 2022 levels, thus effortlessly surpassing the 2019 levels.\n\nPer Embraer\u2019s latest 20-Year Market Outlook, the Asia Pacific, including China, is poised to witness growth of 4.4% per year in its Revenue Passenger Kilometers over 20 years. The report also suggests the possible thriving demand for narrow-body aircraft in the up to 150-seat segment in China.\n\nThis unfolds immense opportunities for Embraer, which is currently seeking to broaden its presence in the region to capitalize on the probable growing demand. The recently acquired certification by the CAAC is a step forward for the company in fulfilling its commitment to solidifying its positioning in China\u2019s aviation market.\n\nPeers to Gain\n\nApart from Embraer, aircraft manufacturers in the industry that have an established position in China and may gain from the flourishing demand are as follows:\n\nAirbus EADSY: The company enjoys significant demand in the region, with its service fleet in China rising to more than 2,100 aircraft up to 2023, implying more than 50% of the market.\n\nIn April 2023, Airbus reached an agreement in the region to expand the A320 Family\u2019s final assembly capacity with a second line at its Tianjin site. The agreement will contribute to Airbus\u2019 overall rate objective of 75 aircraft per month in 2026 throughout its global production network.\n\nStory continues\n\nBoeing BA: The company witnesses strong demand in China. More than 50% of commercial jetliners operating in China are Boeing airplanes.\n\nThe aerospace giant secured an order for eight 787-9 Dreamliners at the 2023 Paris Air Show in June 2023. With this order, the carrier will introduce 24 super-efficient 787s over the next several years.\n\nPrice Movement\n\nIn the past year, shares of Embraer have rallied 40.6% against the industry\u2019s decline of 6.5%.

The award has been offered by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.\n\nDetails of the Deal\n\nValued at $14.7 million, the contract is expected to be completed by June 2028. Per the terms of the deal, Boeing will procure one Harpoon Weapon System (HWS) joint common test set (JCTS); one two-year HWS JCTS interim spares kit; and technical manuals.\n\nUnder this agreement, the jet giant will also offer JCTS weapons station installation and checkout, installation and checkout equipment loan, temporary shipment/loan of tools, weapon station training, JCTS checkout and calibration support, and engineering technical services.\n\nThe contract will serve the government of Egypt. Majority of the work related to this deal will be carried out in St. Charles, MO.\n\nBenefits of the Deal\n\nIncreasing geopolitical tensions worldwide have prompted nations to further strengthen their defense systems. With rapid technological upgrades, missile defense has steadily become pivotal in a nation\u2019s defense strategy. With the United States being the world\u2019s largest weapon supplier and Boeing being a prominent U.S. missile maker, the increased missile defense adoption by the nations provides the company with solid growth opportunities.\n\nNotably, Boeing\u2019s Defense, Space & Security segment engages in the research, development, production and modification of products and related services, including strategic missile and defense systems. Its Harpoon missile is the world\u2019s most successful anti-ship missile and is in service with the armed forces of more than 30 countries.\n\nHarpoon missiles have been upgraded over the years and are now available as the Harpoon Block II. Some other missiles in Boeing\u2019s product portfolio include the supersonic Bomarc missile, the Thor missile, the AGM-86B/C Air Launched Cruise Missile and the GAM-77 Hound Dog Missile.\n\nWith such advanced weaponry in its portfolio, Boeing enjoys solid demand in the missile defense space. The latest contract win is a bright example of that, which, in turn, should boost BA\u2019s top-line growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nGrowth Prospects\n\nNations have increased their defense spending on military equipment and various arsenals to strengthen their defense capabilities. The surge in demand for defense products is primarily due to rising geopolitical tensions and amplified terrorist threats. Hence, military missiles, an integral part of any defense system, have registered a steady growth in demand.\n\nPer a report from Mordor Intelligence, the missiles and missile defense system market is projected to witness a CAGR of 4.8% during 2023-2028. Such abounding growth trends indicate ample development opportunities for Boeing as it enjoys a lucrative position in the missile market.\n\nA few defense primes that can reap the benefits of the aforementioned market are Northrop Grumman NOC, RTX Corporation RTX and Lockheed Martin LMT.\n\nNorthrop Grumman designs and produces missile products, including advanced high-speed propulsion systems, fuses, warheads and controls for air, sea and land-based systems.\n\nThe company boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 4.10%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NOC\u2019s 2023 sales indicates an improvement of 5.6% from the 2022 reported figure.\n\nRTX is a leading designer, developer, integrator, producer and sustainer of integrated air and missile defense systems. Its product portfolio includes Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM), Guidance Enhanced Missile (GEM-T), the National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System (NASAMS), Tomahawk, Standard Missile 2 (SM-2) and a few more.\n\nRTX\u2019s long-term earnings growth rate is 7.9%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2023 sales indicates a 9.9% increase from the prior-year reported figure.\n\nLockheed Martin\u2019s Missiles and Fire Control (MFC) is a recognized designer, developer and manufacturer of precision engagement aerospace and defense systems for the United States and allied militaries. MFC develops, manufactures and supports advanced combat, missile, rocket, manned and unmanned systems for military customers. These include the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, NASA and dozens of foreign allies.\n\nLMT boasts a four-quarter average earnings surprise of 5.04%.

Then it remained grounded on the tarmac.\n\nThree days later, a spare part crucial for navigation systems with a declared value of over a quarter of a million dollars, made by U.S. company Northrop Grumman, arrived for the jet, Russian customs records show.\n\nA week later, on Nov. 24, the A320 took off for Moscow and has been busy ferrying passengers across Russia and Central Asia ever since, according to flight tracking data.\n\nDespite Western sanctions designed to stop Russian carriers from procuring parts for their Airbus and Boeing jets, Ural Airlines has imported over 20 of the U.S.-made devices since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, the customs data show.\n\nAll told, at least $1.2 billion worth of aircraft parts flowed to Russian airlines from May last year - when most U.S. and European trade curbs and export bans over Ukraine were in force - to the end of June this year, a Reuters analysis of the customs records shows.\n\nThe equipment ranged from essential items needed to keep a jet airworthy - such as the Northrop Grumman devices, cabin pressure valves, cockpit displays and landing gear - to more mundane spares, such as coffee makers, flight attendant telephone handsets and toilet seats.\n\nThe customs records showed the parts made their way to Russia through middlemen in countries including Tajikistan, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Turkey, China and Kyrgyzstan \u2013 none of which has endorsed Western sanctions on Russia.\n\nThe $1.2 billion tally underestimates the total value of aircraft parts imported during the period reviewed by Reuters as it only includes shipments destined directly for Russian airlines or their maintenance units - and not plane parts shipped to other companies in Russia.\n\nOleg Panteleev, head of the AviaPort aviation think-tank in Moscow, said Russian airlines have \"solved the problem\" of operating under Western sanctions.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"At first there was a shock, no one knew what to do,\" he told Reuters. \"After two to three months, new supply channels were found and, after six or nine months, quite a lot of alternatives appeared, which allowed for a reduction in prices and delivery times.\"\n\n'UNNECESSARY INFORMATION'\n\nUral Airlines Deputy Chief Executive Kirill Skuratov declined to comment on how the Russian carrier procured its spare parts. \"I definitely will not tell you that,\" he told Reuters. \"It is unnecessary information.\"\n\nAfter reviewing the list compiled by Reuters, Northrop Grumman said it did not identify any sales or repair services by the company to Russian entities. Northrop Grumman said it has \"robust processes and procedures to help ensure compliance with all applicable export and sanctions-related laws and regulations.\"\n\nThe U.S. government said its export controls and those of its allies had severely affected the Russian aviation sector.\n\n\"We will continue to vigorously enforce our controls by rooting out and disrupting illicit networks, pursuing individuals evading restrictions, and directly engaging with industry and foreign governments to ensure compliance,\" a Department of Commerce spokesperson said.\n\nA European Union official said the bloc was closely coordinating with countries that had imposed similar trade curbs to ensure they were not circumvented.\n\n\"Systems are being put in place in some countries for monitoring, controlling and blocking re-exports,\" the official said.\n\nTo be sure, Western sanctions have made life more difficult for Russia's aviation sector.\n\nIn mid 2022, aviation industry sources described how some Russian airlines were stripping some planes for parts. And Russian carrier S7 Airlines said in June last year that it had to scrap plans to launch a low-cost operator because it could not take delivery of the Airbus planes it had ordered.\n\nLike its U.S. rival Boeing, the European planemaker cut links with its Russian clients when sanctions kicked in.\n\nBut as of May 1 this year, Russian carriers had 541 Western planes in active service or under maintenance, according to data compiled by Swiss aviation intelligence provider ch-aviation. That's more or less on a par with before the war, taking into account the 75 planes being leased by Russian airlines that were repossessed by their foreign owners, the ch-aviation data show.\n\nRussian airlines carried 10.1 million passengers in June, according to Russia's federal statistics agency Rosstat, compared to 8.87 million in June 2022 and 11.1 million in June 2021.\n\nWithout Western aircraft, Russian airlines would have had to downsize massively because they only have about 150 Russian-made passenger planes in their fleets, according to ch-aviation data.\n\nRussia's trade ministry and civil aviation authority did not respond to messages seeking comment.\n\nCIRCUITOUS ROUTE\n\nBefore the trade restrictions, Ural Airlines, Aeroflot , S7 and other Russian carriers relied on maintenance support from global firms such as Lufthansa Technik of Germany.\n\nWhen those firms stopped providing services \u2013 Lufthansa Technik said it suspended sales to Russia from Feb. 28, 2022 \u2013 Russian airlines turned to a pool of far smaller suppliers.\n\nIn April 2022, for example, S7's maintenance unit, S7 Engineering, began importing parts from a company in Moldova called Air Rock Solutions, according to the customs records.\n\nThe first shipment was for water filters for Airbus galleys with a declared value of $1,700. Over the next 14 months, S7 received at least $1.23 million of parts from Air Rock, the records show.\n\nIvan Melnicov, chief executive of Air Rock and another aircraft parts distributor in Moldova called Aerostage Services, denied selling products to Russia. He said most of his clients were in the UAE and Kyrgyzstan, among others.\n\n\"Business with Russian companies is impossible to be done from Moldova, simply considering that their banks are banned in Moldova and payments are not processed,\" Melnicov told Reuters. \"We are not interested in losing our local and international partners for short-term income.\"\n\nMost of the shipments listed in Russian customs records as having been made by Air Rock and Aerostage took circuitous routes, transiting through the UAE or Kyrgyzstan. Asked if that could indicate his clients in those countries had re-routed deliveries to Russian airlines, the Moldovan businessman did not respond.\n\nS7 and Aeroflot did not respond to messages seeking comment.\n\nNOSE TO TAIL SERVICES\n\nThe serial number listed in Russian customs records for the Northrop Grumman device sent to Yekaterinburg last year shows the part was manufactured in October 2008, and used on different aircraft, including one in Saudi Arabia six year ago, according to an industry source with access to maintenance databases.\n\nWhile the customs records don't name the company that shipped the device in November, they do show how more of the same crucial U.S. parts fitted with high-tech laser gyroscopes reached Urals Airlines during the 14-month period reviewed by Reuters.\n\nIn July 2022, for example, one was shipped to Ural Airlines via the UAE by Istikloliyat 20, a civil engineering company based in Tajikistan. In September 2022, another Tajik civil engineering firm, Kafolati Komil, also sent one of the parts to Russia via the UAE, the data show.\n\nMahmadbashir Yakubov, chief executive of Istikloliyat 20, did not respond to phone messages seeking comment. Reuters was unable to reach Komilchon Yakubov, the chief executive of Kafolati Komil.\n\nSome of the shipments of Northrop Grumman parts to Ural Airlines that went through the UAE were handled by a company named Skyparts FZCO, the customs records show.\n\nCreated in June 2022 and registered in a single-room office in one of Dubai's free economic zones, Skyparts says on its website it was founded by aviation professionals and offers customers \"nose to tail\" support for their aircraft.\n\nAsked about the shipments of the Northrop Grumman device, Skyparts manager Saeed Abdulloev told Reuters he was familiar with the part and confirmed that the Dubai firm was doing business with Tajik companies, including Istikloliyat 20.\n\nHe said Skyparts had procured one of the Northrop Grumman parts from a U.S. supplier but denied ever sending it to Russia. He declined to identify the U.S. firm.\n\nHUSBAND AND WIFE\n\nOne Russian carrier, Nordwind Airlines, appears to have harnessed family ties to procure parts for the 12 Airbus and 15 Boeing aircraft in its fleet, the customs data show.\n\nOwned by Russian entrepreneur Karine Bukrey, according to corporate records, the airline imported hundreds of parts from Ramses Turizm. Based in the Turkish resort town of Antalya, Ramses Turizm is owned by Bukrey's husband, Ramazan Akpinar.\n\nNordwind and Bukrey did not respond to messages seeking comment.\n\nContacted by Reuters on April 4 this year, Akpinar confirmed owning Ramses Turizm and being married to Bukrey. He did not answer questions about aircraft part exports to Nordwind.\n\nThe Russian records show Nordwind stopped receiving parts from Ramses Turizm three days after Reuters asked about them. However, the airline carried on importing parts from another Turkish company, Na Havacilik ve Teknik, also based in Antalya.\n\nReuters was unable to reach Nusret Alper, who founded Na Havacilik in August 2022, for comment.\n\nNordwind also imported parts via its maintenance unit, NW Technic, according to the customs records. Chief Executive Valery Pashaev told Reuters his unit was solely focused on maintaining aircraft and was not involved in parts procurement.\n\n\"People bring me parts and tell me where to install them,\" Pashaev said. \"I take the parts and install them.\"\n\n(Additional reporting by Lisa Barrington in Dubai and Maurice Tamman in New York; Editing by David Clarke and Daniel Flynn)", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/insight-russia-keeps-fleet-western-064004121.html", "symbols": ["AIR.F", "AIR.MC", "AIR.PA", "AIR.XETRA", "AIRA.F", "BA.MX", "BA.US", "BCO.F", "BCO.XETRA", "BOEI34.SA", "EADSF.US", "EADSY.US", "NOC.US", "NOCG34.SA", "NTH.F"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.676, "neg": 0.024, "neu": 0.944, "pos": 0.033}}, {"date": "2023-08-22T16:51:47+00:00", "title": "S&amp;P Slashes Ratings Of 5 US Banks, SEC Fines Fintech Adviser Titan For Misleading Crypto Claims, Microsoft Modifies Activision Blizzard Proposal: Today's Top Stories", "content": "Benzinga\n\nS&P Slashes Ratings Of 5 US Regional Banks Facing Growing Challenges\n\nS&P Global Ratings has cast a spotlight on the challenges faced by several U.S. regional banks, resulting in a series of downgrades that have reverberated through the financial sector.

The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD, has awarded the deal.\n\nValued at $59.3 million, the contract is scheduled to be completed by December 2025. Per the terms of this deal, RTX Corp. will procure Lot 16 advanced long-lead-time hardware in support of Lot 18 F135 propulsion systems equipped in F-35 Lighting II Joint Strike Fighter aircraft.\n\nThe work related to the deal will be carried out at multiple locations across the nation.\n\nWhat\u2019s Favoring RTX?\n\nPratt & Whitney enjoys a considerable order inflow for military jet engines, buoyed by its in-depth expertise in manufacturing the same. The business unit has been manufacturing and sustaining the F135 engine for the U.S. government\u2019s F-35 Joint Program to power the single-engine F-35 Lightning II aircraft produced by Lockheed MartinLMT.\n\nF135 propulsion system configurations are used for the U.S. Air Force\u2019s F-35A, the U.S. Marine Corps\u2019 F-35B and the U.S. Navy\u2019s F-35C jets. F135 engines are also used in F-35 aircraft purchased by Joint Strike Fighter partner countries and other countries through foreign military sales arrangements.\n\nThe strong demand for F35 has indeed been beneficial for Pratt & Whitney as it has led to a steady stream of orders for F135 engines. Lockheed Martin has successfully delivered 944 F-35 airplanes since the program's inception as of Jun 30, 2023. This underscores the concurrent demand for the F135 engine, which is the power source for this advanced stealth fighter jet.\n\nGoing forward, LMT anticipates F-35 delivery numbers in the band of 147-153 jets per year in 2023 and 2024. Lockheed Martin also expects to supply nearly 156 jets in 2025 and beyond. This ensures a steady flow of F135 engine production and sustainment orders for RTXCorp., like the latest one. This should bolster RTX\u2019s revenues from the Pratt & Whitney business unit.\n\nStory continues\n\nGrowth Prospects\n\nAs nations continue to prioritize bolstering their defense capabilities, in the days ahead, we can expect to see a growing commitment to investing in advanced fighter jets.\n\nPer the reports from Expert Market Research, the global military aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of 5.1% from 2023 to 2028.
