We are assessing with Boeing how this will impact the 24 737 aircraft which are scheduled for delivery in the remainder of April, May and June.\u201d Boeing 737 Max aircraft - REUTERS/Peter Cziborra/File Photo\n\nBoeing\u2019s 737 Max and rival Airbus\u2019s A320 single-aisle jets are the workhorses of cross-continental flight, carrying passengers between European and North American cities for work and holidays.\n\nThey have both been crucial in the nascent recovery of air travel after the pandemic. Any slowdown in production could hit airlines\u2019 plans for expansion.\n\nBoeing is also struggling to recover confidence in the 737 Max after two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019 claimed the lives of 346 passengers and triggered a grounding of the craft. Faulty software was found to be the cause.\n\nThe company said it had told its regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration, about the construction error, adding that it was \u201cworking to conduct inspections and replace the non-conforming fittings where necessary\u201d.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe problem affects other craft in the 737 Max \u201cfamily\u201d, Boeing said, including the Max 7, Max 8 and Max 8200 planes, in addition to the P-8 Poseidon maritime surveillance aircraft.\n\nSpirit said it and Boeing would work towards a solution.\n\nSmaller jets contribute the majority of sales at both Boeing and Airbus, with intercontinental jets with two aisles proving less popular among customers.\n\nAlthough the 737 Max jets have now been signed off as safe by regulators, Boeing has been hit by supply chain problems and production delays. But airlines are keen to acquire the aircraft as it will cut carriers\u2019 fuel costs and reduce emissions.\n\nIn February, it emerged Boeing would cut 2,000 office jobs in the US as the struggling planemaker battles to improve its stalling production line.\n\nRoughly a third of the roles being cut will be outsourced to India, The Seattle Times reported, with the remainder disappearing completely.\n\nBoeing said it will increase its overall workforce size by 10,000 this year, with a \u201cfocus on engineering and manufacturing\u201d roles.

We're seeing Boeing shares really hammered here, Brad, down about 5% here. Losses really accelerating here throughout the early going. And very disappointing for Boeing. Just a couple of weeks ago--\n\nI'll do a name drop here because it's Friday. And I feel like I want to do that. I talked to Dave Calhoun on a call when they struck a big, almost $40 billion deal with Saudi Arabia. And he sounded like a confident CEO. CEOs are always confident. But he sounded like, you know what, Brian, we're starting to get beyond the major problems-- production problems we have had. He told me that the supply chain was starting to improve.\n\nAnd then, Brad, you have news like this. And it's just like, wow, what is the state of Boeing? And when are they officially going to be just that good, old-fashioned US manufacturer that is steady Eddie? And maybe it's not today.\n\nBRAD SMITH: Yeah, into some of the numbers here, during the first quarter of 2023, they delivered about 113 737 MAXes. Of course, the news today is that they're going to have to halt and ultimately inspect for where Spirit AeroSystems and the kind of manufacturing mishap took place.\n\nBut here's where the real issue is. The number of-- we mentioned 113 737 commercial airplanes in delivery that had taken place during the first quarter. That was out of a pie of 130 total, which means you only had one 747 get delivered. You only had one 767 get delivered. You only had 777s get delivered and then 11 787s there.\n\nNow, at the end of the day for Boeing, this is important to remember because between Boeing and Airbus, they make up essentially 90% based on some Thiel Group data, 90%, if not more than that, of the large plane orders internationally. And so with that in mind, I mean this is significant because it really paints this picture, at least in the orders that Boeing has taken on, where there are still some of the uncovers of where--\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd Spirit AeroSystems, this is not the first time that they've been in the news about one of these issues with regard to the production. So at the end of the day, I think coming right back to that, it just goes, once again, against everything that Boeing's been trying to paint in this recovery story as well, which, for the 737, had done well. I flew a 737 a couple of weeks back.\n\nBRIAN SOZZI: You actually flew the plane?\n\nBRAD SMITH: I did not fly it.\n\nBRIAN SOZZI: Oh, I've been on the show in a while. So I've missed, I think, a couple of things. But I thought, wow, what did I miss?\n\nBRAD SMITH: I've got a lot of side gigs, flying planes isn't one of them.\n\n[LAUGHTER]\n\nBRIAN SOZZI: Wow, my god.\n\nBRAD SMITH: I wish.\n\nBRIAN SOZZI: Oh, it's Friday.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/video/boeing-stock-slides-company-halts-134256322.html", "symbols": ["BA.MX", "BA.US", "BCO.F", "BCO.XETRA", "BOEI34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.989, "neg": 0.031, "neu": 0.864, "pos": 0.105}}, {"date": "2023-04-14T13:41:09+00:00", "title": "Boeing Falls as Parts Issue Stifles 737 Max Deliveries", "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Boeing Co. is pausing deliveries of some 737 Max jets to address a production issue on the rear end of some aircraft, dealing a setback to the US manufacturer just as it ramps up production of the model that\u2019s a major cash cow for the company.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nUS Embarrassed After 21-Year-Old Arrested in Classified Documents Leak Arnault's Wealth Soars to $210 Billion, Leaving Musk in the Dust US-Saudi Oil Pact Breaking Down as Russia Grabs Upper Hand JPMorgan Says Frank\u2019s Javice Moved Millions to a Shell Company US Arrests 21-Year-Old National Guardsman in Classified Documents Leak\n\nThe shares fell 6.1% to $200.49 as of 9:37 a.m. in New York Friday after Boeing said late Thursday it expects deliveries to decline in the near-term as it inspects affected aircraft. Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc., which supplies the faulty part, declined 18% \u2014 its biggest drop in more than three years \u2014 to $29.18.\n\nBoeing was just regaining its footing following years of turmoil caused by the pandemic and a global grounding of the single-aisle Max. The planemaker had been briefing customers on plans to increase production rates of the Max, Bloomberg reported last week. Days later, Boeing reported a surge in quarterly deliveries that outpaced rival Airbus SE for the first time in almost five years.\n\n\u201cPrior to the announcement, Boeing was coming off a high,\u201d Jefferies analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu wrote in a note.\n\nBased on preliminary knowledge, the analyst expects to cut her estimate for Max deliveries this year by 20% from its current level of 425 planes. She sees an $800 million hit to free cash flow for Boeing, where the Max represents more than a quarter of expected 2023 revenue.\n\nRead More: Boeing to Boost Output of 737 Jets in Push for More Cash\n\nThe planemaker said it was formally notified of the issue on April 12 by Spirit, which assembles most of the 737\u2019s aluminum frame. The problem involves two of the eight fittings that attach the jet\u2019s vertical tail to the rear end of its fuselage.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe issue involves Boeing\u2019s best-selling 737 Max 8, Max 7, a high-density version, along with a militarized 737 known as the P-8. Spirit and Boeing said they have identified the production numbers of the planes with the problematic fittings, though not every jet is affected.\n\nIt\u2019s too soon to tell if the quality flaw will affect Boeing\u2019s plans to speed up 737 production. The planemaker is working to learn the extent of the problem and what\u2019s required to address it, according to the company.\n\nAirlines\u2019 Max Dependence\n\nUnited Airlines Holdings Inc. said it doesn\u2019t expect a significant impact to flying plans for the summer. Southwest Airlines Co. said it\u2019s talking with Boeing to determine the effect on deliveries this year and beyond, but has a \u201cnear term cushion\u201d in terms of available aircraft.\n\nSouthwest, which is counting on the Max for future fleet growth, estimates it will receive 100 of the aircraft this year, while United is scheduled to receive 135, according to regulatory filings.\n\nThe manufacturing issue doesn\u2019t immediately affect the safety of planes in the air, Boeing said. It likely involves a significant number of undelivered aircraft that are either in production or storage, and a portion of in-service jets built as far back as 2019, according to the company.\n\nBoeing stock was down about 4.8% in European trading on Friday, after closing at $213.59 in New York. Wichita, Kansas-based Spirit fell 12% from its Thursday close of $35.60.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says:\n\n\u201cThe stoppage is concerning given the airplane is vital to Boeing\u2019s turnaround. Its importance likely means a remedy will be urgently pursued, though reworking it could be costly and an extended pause would significantly hurt commercial profit, cash generation and the balance sheet.\u201d\n\n\u2014 George Ferguson, BI aerospace industry analyst\n\nClick here to read the research\n\n\u201cWe have processes in place to address these of types of production issues upon identification, which we are following,\u201d Spirit said in a separate statement. \u201cSpirit is working to develop an inspection and repair for the affected fuselages.\u201d\n\nInspections, Rework\n\nThe inspections will take place in an accessible area of the structure. That means any rework is likely to be far less disruptive than Boeing\u2019s repairs to address structural imperfections with the 787 Dreamliner, the company said.\n\nDeliveries of those planes were halted for more than a year, starting in mid-2021, over tiny manufacturing flaws in the jet\u2019s carbon-composite frame. In some instances they could only be reached by ripping out aircraft cabins.\n\nBoeing temporarily paused Dreamliner deliveries again earlier this year after learning of a documentation issue with a fuselage component. Analysts expect Boeing officials to provide updates on the company\u2019s efforts to stabilize 737 and 787 production at its April 18 annual meeting and first-quarter earnings report on April 26.\n\n\u201cThis is another loss of credibility and trust in Boeing production quality and standards,\u201d said aviation consultant Mark D Martin. \u201cWhile the extent of the rework required is unknown, on the face of it, it could be extremely expensive.\u201d\n\n--With assistance from Richard Clough, Siddharth Philip, Anurag Kotoky and Mary Schlangenstein.\n\n(Updates with opening shares in second paragraph; Adds airlines comments from ninth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nA Smart Gun Is Finally Here, But Does Anyone Want It?

As the New Year arrived, the bubble burst, and the index has remained below that level for more than 30 years!\n\nHowever, Japanese stocks have seen demand this year\u2013with the Nikkei up over 9% year to date\u2013as signs of easing inflation and a leadership change in the Bank of Japan saw markets bet that the central bank will maintain its ultra-easy monetary policy in the near term.\n\nNews that America\u2019s most popular investor has increased his holdings in Japan\u2019s five major trading houses as well as talk that he is considering more local investment is likely to lead to more widespread interest.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Futures just lower; Tesla cuts Model 3 price in Germany\n\nU.S. futures traded marginally lower Friday, with investors consolidating after the previous session\u2019s strong gains ahead of the start of the new earnings season.\n\nAt 04:30 ET (08:30 GMT), the Dow futures contract had dropped 95 points or 0.3%, S&P 500 futures inched 7 points or 0.2% lower, and Nasdaq 100 futures fell 27 points or 0.2%.\n\nThe main indices closed firmly higher Thursday, with investors cheered by the cooling of the March producer prices, suggesting a less hawkish Federal Reserve going ahead.\n\nThe earnings from a number of the nation\u2019s biggest banks will be in focus Friday [see above].\n\nElsewhere, big insurer UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) is also expected to report earnings. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has lowered the price of its Model 3 in Germany by around 4.5%, according to data on its website, and Boeing (NYSE:BA) has halted deliveries of some 737 MAXs as it grapples with a new supplier quality problem.\n\n4. U.S. economic data deluge\n\nFresh off the release of the lowest U.S. headline inflation rate in almost two years and minutes from the last Federal Reserve meeting talking about a \u201cmild recession\u201d, investors have a number of economic data releases to study later Friday.\n\nRetail sales for March are expected at 08:30 ET (12:30 GMT), and are expected to show a year-over-year gain of 5.9% versus the 5.4% in the previous month, and a monthly contraction of 0.4%, same as before.\n\nIndustrial production, released 45 minutes later, is seen growing 0.2% on the month in March, an annual drop of 0.9%, while the preliminary reading of the consumer sentiment index from the University of Michigan is due at 10:00 ET.\n\n5. Oil prices creep higher, heading for another positive week\n\nCrude prices edged higher Friday, with the market heading for a fourth straight week of gains, supported by signs of a tightening global market.\n\nBy 04:30 ET, U.S. crude futures were 0.1% higher at $82.25 a barrel, while the Brent contract edged up to $86.10 per barrel.\n\nThe monthly report from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, released on Thursday, forecast that world markets would be under-supplied by about 2 million barrels a day in the fourth quarter as a result of the cartel\u2019s recent cutbacks.\n\nThe International Energy Agency is set to release its monthly oil market report later in the session, and traders will be looking to see if the Paris-based organization downgrades its global demand outlook given the faltering macroeconomic growth.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nBig bank earnings, IEA report, Tesla prices - what's moving markets\n\nDollar set for longest stretch of weekly losses since 2020\n\nU.S. money market funds draw inflows for fifth straight week", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-bank-earnings-iea-report-045145051.html", "symbols": ["BA.US", "C.US", "GSPC.INDX", "JPM.US", "TL0.F", "TL0.XETRA", "TSLA.MX", "TSLA.US", "TSLA34.SA", "UNH.US", "WFC.US"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.986, "neg": 0.05, "neu": 0.854, "pos": 0.096}}, {"date": "2023-04-14T00:18:12+00:00", "title": "Boeing says deliveries of 737 Max jet will be held up by production issue", "content": "Boeing said on Thursday that a production issue would affect its ability to deliver a \u201csignificant\u201d number of 737 Max jets, worsening aircraft shortages for airlines around the world.

The award has been offered by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.\n\nDetails of the Deal\n\nThe contract, valued at $1.17 billion, is expected to get completed by March 2029. Per the terms of the deal, Boeing will supply 400 RGM-84L-4 Harpoon Block II Update (HIIU) Grade B canister tactical missiles, four RTM-84L-4 Block II HIIU Grade B canister exercise missiles, 411 containers, four blast test vehicles and two Harpoon Weapon System Joint Common Test Sets (JCTS).\n\nThe jet giant will also deliver Harpoon Coastal Defense System (HCDS) spares, weapon station support equipment, JCTS spares and missile spares. It will also provide HCDS training equipment, integrated logistics support and technical publications, field service representatives and training.\n\nA major portion of work related to this deal will be executed in McKinney, TX and Pontiac, MI.\n\nBenefits of the Deal\n\nIncreasing geopolitical tensions worldwide have prompted nations to further strengthen their defense systems. With rapid technological upgrades, missile defense has steadily become pivotal in a nation\u2019s defense strategy. With the United States being the world\u2019s largest weapon supplier and Boeing being a prominent U.S. missile maker, the increased missile defense adoption by the nations provides the company with solid growth opportunities.\n\nNotably, Boeing\u2019s Defense, Space & Security segment engages in the research, development, production and modification of products and related services, including strategic missile and defense systems. Its Harpoon missile is the world\u2019s most successful anti-ship missile and is in service with the armed forces of more than 30 countries.\n\nHarpoon missiles have been upgraded over the years and are now available as the Harpoon Block II. Some other missiles in Boeing\u2019s product portfolio include the supersonic Bomarc missile, Thor missile, AGM-86B/C Air Launched Cruise Missile and GAM-77 Hound Dog Missile.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith such advanced weaponry in its portfolio, Boeing enjoys solid demand in the defense space. The latest contract is a bright example of that, which, in turn, should boost its top-line growth.\n\nGrowth Prospects\n\nNations have increased their defense spending on military equipment and various arsenals to strengthen their defense capabilities. The surge in demand for defense products is primarily due to rising geopolitical tensions and amplified terrorist threats. Hence, military missiles, an integral part of any defense system, have registered a steady growth in demand.\n\nPer the report from Mordor Intelligence, the missiles and missile defense system market is projected to witness a CAGR of 4.9% from 2022-2027. Such abounding growth trends indicate ample development opportunities for Boeing as it enjoys a lucrative position in the missile market.\n\nA few defense primes that can reap the benefits of the aforementioned market are Northrop Grumman NOC, Raytheon Technologies RTX and Lockheed Martin LMT.\r\n\r\nNorthrop Grumman designs and produces missile products, including advanced high-speed propulsion systems, fuses, warheads and controls for air, sea and land-based systems.\n\nThe company boasts a long-term earnings growth of 3.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NOC\u2019s 2023 sales reflects an improvement of 4.6% from the 2022 reported figure.\n\nRaytheon\u2019s Missiles & Defense is a leading designer, developer, integrator, producer and sustainer of integrated air and missile defense systems. The unit serves as a prime contractor or major subcontractor on numerous missile and related programs with the U.S. Department of Defense.\n\nRaytheon\u2019s long-term earnings growth is pegged at 8.3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for RTX\u2019s 2023 sales indicates a 7.8% increase from the prior-year reported figure.\n\nLockheed Martin\u2019s Missiles and Fire Control (MFC) is a recognized designer, developer and manufacturer of precision engagement aerospace and defense systems for the United States and allied militaries. MFC develops, manufactures and supports advanced combat, missile, rocket, manned and unmanned systems for military customers. These include the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, NASA and dozens of foreign allies.\n\nLMT\u2019s long-term earnings growth is pegged at 6.9%. Shares of the company have gained 4.4% in the past year.\n\nPrice Performance\n\nShares of Boeing have rallied 16.8% in the past year against the industry\u2019s 8.9% decline.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co., AbbVie Inc. and NextEra Energy, Inc. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today's research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nShares of JPMorgan Chase have outperformed the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry and the broader market over the past year (+0.9% vs. -16.7% for the industry and -8.2% for the S&P 500 index). The stock has lagged the broader market as well as the industry over the past month or so since the banking problems took center stage.\n\nThe stock was up in response to the last quarterly release on January 13th when the company handily beat estimates and provided reassuring commentary on broader business trends. Ahead of Q1 earnings release before the market's open this Friday (April 14th), estimates have largely been unchanged. A lot will be riding on management's characterization of business conditions following the Silicon Valley episode.\n\nHigher rates and a steady loan demand are expected to have aided net interest income (NII) growth in the Q1 report. Yet, the volatile nature of the capital markets business and higher mortgage rates are likely to have made fee income growth challenging. We expect non-interest income (managed) to be relatively stable this year.\r\n\r\nHowever, steadily rising costs is a major woe, and we expect the same to rise 5.8% in 2023. Given the possibility of an economic slowdown, provisions are likely to keep rising, with we projecting the same to jump 53.1% in 2023.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on JPMorgan here >>>)\r\n\r\nAbbVie shares have gained +4.5% over the past year against the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry's gain of +7.5%. The company has several new drugs in its portfolio that have the potential to drive the top line to make up for lost Humira revenues. Skyrizi and Rinvoq have established outstanding launch trajectories bolstered by the approval of new indications.\r\n\r\nIt has several early/mid-stage candidates that have blockbuster potential. However, there are concerns about long-term sales growth since Humira generics have entered the U.S. market. Slowing consumer demand due to economic pressure is hurting the aesthetics franchise's sales.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, though revenues are expected to decline in 2023, AbbVie expects to return to robust sales growth in 2025. Estimates have declined ahead of Q1 earnings. AbbVie has a positive record of earnings surprises in recent quarters.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on AbbVie here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of NextEra Energy have gained +8.4% over the past six months against the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry's gain of +13.7%. The company continues to expand its operations through the efficient execution of organic projects and strategic acquisitions. The company currently has many renewable projects in its backlog and their completion will ensure reduced emissions.\r\n\r\nThe merger of Gulf Power and FPL strengthens NextEra's position in Florida. FPL's customer base is expanding as Florida's economy improves and continues to boost demand for its services. NextEra has ample liquidity to meet its near-term debt obligations and efficient debt management acting as tailwinds. Its shares have lost narrower than industry in the past one year.\r\n\r\nHowever, the nature of its business is subject to complex federal, state and other regulations. Risk in operating nuclear units, unfavorable weather conditions and an increase in supply costs adversely impact earnings.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on NextEra Energy here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include The Boeing Co. and Canadian Natural Resources Ltd.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +6.2 average gain per year.

Tetra-1 is healthy and ready for mission operations.\n\n\"Tetra-1 has helped us learn about small satellites' potential to operate in super GEO,\" said Capt JeanCarlo Vasquez, Tetra-1 deputy program manager at SSC. \"Due to Tetra-1's maneuverability, it has enabled us to experiment and train with various tactics, techniques, and procedures. Thus, allowing our program office and operators to identify what roles small satellites can potentially play in future USSF Missions. Furthermore, Tetra-1's robustness permitted SSC to work with Space Delta 11 in Space Training and Readiness Command and perform maneuvers dedicated solely to a live on orbit training campaign, known as 'Scarlet Star.'\"\n\nSSC is now assuming full spacecraft operations, using the procedures developed jointly with Millennium Space Systems.\n\n\"We developed new operations tools to ease the planning for actions like station changes and planning and executing on-orbit maneuvering,\" said Mike Todaro, vice president of Mission Operations & Integration at Millennium Space Systems. \"This is particularly important for super GEO, where if you're not mission capable, you're considered in the graveyard.\"\n\nSuper GEO is new ground for small satellites, with known and unknown challenges operating so far away \u2013 about 38,000 km from Earth.\n\n\"When Guardians work on Tetra-1, they'll learn new ways of doing things that were previously done on much larger satellites,\" said Todaro. \"Because Tetra-1 is smaller, more agile and maneuverable, you have different options. It's like the difference between maneuvering a speed boat versus a cruise ship.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nThe experience Tetra-1 provides is critical to space operators understanding how to manage a small satellite. An example is operating during eclipse season.\n\n\"Actions for what you want the satellite to do are taken more deliberately because it has a smaller power system,\" said Todaro. \"And operators must manage consumables differently compared to a larger satellite, all of which requires training beyond just having classroom knowledge \u2013 it takes hands-on experience.\"\n\nMillennium Space Systems delivered the spacecraft and ground software to SSC to operate independently, and provided a different type of training, simulation and confidence-building for operators to understand the nuances of a small satellite. This training experience, new tools and space-qualified spacecraft components support Millennium Space Systems' ability to deliver small satellites for high-stakes critical missions for National Security Space.\n\nMedia Contact: \r\nDana Carroll, vice president, Marketing\r\nMillennium Space Systems\r\ndana.carroll@millennium-space.com\n\nAbout Millennium Space Systems\n\nMillennium Space Systems, a Boeing Company, delivers high-performance prototype and constellation solutions across advanced national security and environmental observation missions.

These companies are household names with track records of steady growth and operational profitability in some cases over decades. They\u2019ve weathered economic cyclicality and the recessions that come with it, making them particularly timely.\n\nWe\u2019re exploring those blue-chip stocks that beat the market in 2023. I define that as providing better returns than the average of the 7.35% return from the S&P 500 year-to-date and the 1.05% return from the Dow Jones Industrial Average. So, we\u2019re talking about shares that exceeded 4.2% returns in 2023, also listed here.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBlue-Chip Stocks: American Express (AXP) the American Express logo etched into wood\n\nSource: First Class Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) is well-known for providing credit cards catering to more affluent customers. Those same affluent customers tend to be less affected by economic downturns. In turn, it\u2019s logical to guess that the company stands to do better in the difficult environment this year. So far, that has been the case.\n\nAmerican Express had a very strong 2022, during which it reached its goal of delivering 25% revenue growth. It did exactly that, reaching $52.86 billion in sales on payments volume that increased by a slightly smaller 21%.\n\nThe company\u2019s strategy focuses on acquiring more customers and growing that base. American Express established 12.5 million new card accounts in 2022. Investors should expect companywide EPS to increase by 15-17% in 2023. The company has rewarded investors for the strong year by planning to increase its dividend by 15%. American Express\u2019s stable business and customer base give it advantages in this environment, suggesting continued strength.\n\nBoeing (BA) It Will Be a Very Long Road to Recovery for BA Stock\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nStory continues\n\nBoeing (NYSE:BA) is moving into a new chapter as sales ramp up and problems of the recent past fade. A strong sales trajectory and a backlog of business suggest that Boeing is back. That said, Boeing continues to have operational difficulties that resulted in net losses overall in 2022, a continuation of 2021 results.\n\nBoeing\u2019s 2022 sales increased by 7% to $66.61 billion. Boeing suffered a net loss again in 2022 but posted a positive operating cash flow of $3.5 billion, largely due to Q4 results. That led to positive cash flows during the year.\n\nBA stock is trending upward in 2023 because the business is now headed in the right direction after major setbacks. Boeing delivered 480 commercial planes and recorded 808 orders overall. With supply chains returning to normal, Boeing should be able to better fulfill that backlog, including a large order of its 787 Dreamliners to Saudi carriers. Thus, it is among the top blue-chip stocks.\n\nDisney (DIS) dis stock the Disney logo in red font on a storefront\n\nSource: David Tran Photo / Shutterstock.com\n\nDisney (NYSE:DIS) continues to grow at an impressive rate, especially for a firm of its size. Meanwhile, the company is undertaking efforts to reorganize to increase efficiency. Let\u2019s focus on those two aspects of its story to understand why it does well even in a challenging economy.\n\nDisney\u2019s fiscal year\u2019s first quarter ends on Dec. 31, which, for most other firms, is the end of the fiscal year. Despite the slight difference, Disney moved into the new year with strong momentum on an 8% increase in sales. That solid growth increased EPS from $0.63 to $0.70 in Q1 year-over-year.\n\nMeanwhile, Disney is reorganizing for efficiency as the economy tightens. Structurally, the company has realigned its three core businesses, Entertainment, ESPN, Parks, Products, and Experiences, to be headed separately. The company believes the reorganization will reduce inefficiency leading to $5.5 billion in savings.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) McDonald's restaurant in Thailand.\n\nSource: Tama2u / Shutterstock\n\nLet\u2019s face it, current headlines about McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) expose the brutal truth of business. Even when business and stock are strong, restructuring will continue to occur. Like Disney, another thriving business, McDonald\u2019s is restructuring and conducting layoffs.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s began a round of layoffs beginning April 3, targeting hundreds of corporate employees. I can\u2019t speak to their individual performance. They may indeed be less productive. But McDonald\u2019s grew by 12% in Q4 with double-digit growth across all segments. During 2022, company-wide sales increased by 10%. Business is business, but there\u2019s a human toll exacted that broad metrics simply can\u2019t account for.\n\nThe result of current layoffs is likely to be a boon to MCD stock from the perspective of the markets. It\u2019ll be viewed as leaner and ready for the next growth cycle. McDonald\u2019s has also continued to focus on affordability and a pared-down menu which are arguably strengths currently.\n\nWalmart (WMT) Walmart sign on front of Walmart store at sundown\n\nSource: fotomak / Shutterstock.com\n\nReaders are likely aware that Walmart (NYSE:WMT) is the world\u2019s largest retailer. But the facts about its massive scale provide a bit more perspective for us to understand its relevance. Let\u2019s look at some of those statistics.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest retailer tallied $572.75 billion in worldwide revenues in 2022 from its 10,953 locations, 4,650 of which are U.S. located. That means that 140 million customers visit Walmart every week.\n\nThe company has become the largest grocery store in the U.S. as well. That\u2019s probably not surprising to those of you who have visited recently: The grocery section dominates the store. However, what is interesting \u2013 at least to me \u2013 is that Walmart became the largest U.S. grocer back in 2001.\n\nI\u2019m trying to make a simple point: Walmart continues to dominate in 2023 with low-price offerings, especially on staple items. That is a strong reason that its stock continues to perform well.\n\nGeneral Electric (GE) Company breakups: The General Electric GE logo on a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe past is not a prologue. And that\u2019s a positive for General Electric (NYSE:GE) stock which has provided negative annual returns over the last decade. The company had long been in a slow decline, and following years of declining revenues, it was dropped from the DJIA in 2018 as the last original component. 2023 has started very differently for the firm as it outperforms the market.\n\nThe reason for the strong performance has to do with overarching trends and a military build-up. The firm\u2019s new XA100 military jet engine is shrouded in mystery. Few outside the military have seen the engine, and those that recently did were allowed no recording devices in the room where it was displayed.\n\nGE hopes the engines will be fitted to sixth-generation fighter jets used by the U.S. and its allies. Rising tension in the Pacific ensures GE will continue to receive serious attention for the next few years at least. Thus, it is one of the top blue-chip stocks in my book.\n\nExxon Mobil (XOM) Exxon Mobil logo outside of a corporate building\n\nSource: Harry Green / Shutterstock.com\n\n2022 was an exceptionally strong year for Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) as favorable market prices resulted in $55.74 billion in earnings. That was more than double the earnings Exxon Mobil reported a year earlier.\n\nBut it\u2019s difficult to maintain strength and grow quarter after quarter. Like all big oil firms, Exxon Mobil rewards investors willing to experience that volatility with revenues and share buybacks. Its dividend is extremely safe, having last been reduced in 1983. In any case, the point here is that Exxon Mobil, as a company, is adept at manipulating its share price to remain smooth despite volatile commodity markets.\n\nSo, it does well even when the price of Brent crude trends is lower. However, it might not have to worry as much now about playing defensively. OPEC+ cut production, which suggests that per barrel prices should rise as firms scramble to fill the supply gap. That\u2019s a positive catalyst for XOM stock which has done well over the last three years despite the tumult.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM), AbbVie Inc. (ABBV) and NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nShares of JPMorgan Chase have outperformed the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry and the broader market over the past year (+0.9% vs. -16.7% for the industry and -8.2% for the S&P 500 index). The stock has lagged the broader market as well as the industry over the past month or so since the banking problems took center stage.\n\nThe stock was up in response to the last quarterly release on January 13th when the company handily beat estimates and provided reassuring commentary on broader business trends. Ahead of Q1 earnings release before the market's open this Friday (April 14th), estimates have largely been unchanged. A lot will be riding on management's characterization of business conditions following the Silicon Valley episode.\n\nHigher rates and a steady loan demand are expected to have aided net interest income (NII) growth in the Q1 report. Yet, the volatile nature of the capital markets business and higher mortgage rates are likely to have made fee income growth challenging. We expect non-interest income (managed) to be relatively stable this year.\r\n\r\nHowever, steadily rising costs is a major woe, and we expect the same to rise 5.8% in 2023. Given the possibility of an economic slowdown, provisions are likely to keep rising, with we projecting the same to jump 53.1% in 2023.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on JPMorgan here >>>)\r\n\r\nAbbVie shares have gained +4.5% over the past year against the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry\u2019s gain of +7.5%. The company has several new drugs in its portfolio that have the potential to drive the top line to make up for lost Humira revenues. Skyrizi and Rinvoq have established outstanding launch trajectories bolstered by the approval in new indications.\r\n\r\nIt has several early/mid-stage candidates that have blockbuster potential. However, there are concerns about long-term sales growth since Humira generics have entered the U.S. market. Slowing consumer demand due to economic pressure is hurting the aesthetics franchise\u2019s sales.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, though revenues are expected to decline in 2023, AbbVie expects to return to robust sales growth in 2025. Estimates have declined ahead of Q1 earnings. AbbVie has a positive record of earnings surprises in recent quarters.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on AbbVie here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of NextEra Energy have gained +8.4% over the past six months against the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry\u2019s gain of +13.7%. The company continues to expand its operations through the efficient execution of organic projects and strategic acquisitions. The company currently has many renewable projects in its backlog and their completion will ensure reduced emissions.\r\n\r\nThe merger of Gulf Power and FPL strengthens NextEra\u2019s position in Florida. FPL\u2019s customer base is expanding as Florida\u2019s economy improves and continues to boost demand for its services. NextEra has ample liquidity to meet its near-term debt obligations and efficient debt management acting as tailwinds. Its shares have lost narrower than industry in the past one year.\r\n\r\nHowever, the nature of its business is subject to complex federal, state and other regulations.

Yet, paused production of 777X-9 may result in abnormal production costs which may hurt its performance.\n\nBP Likely to Benefit From Lightsource BP JV Acquisition\r\nThe acquisition will enable BP to increase its access to renewable power generation and simplify the decision-making processes. However, rising exploration expenses concern the Zacks analyst.\n\nDiverse Production Mix to Aid Canadian Natural (CNQ)\r\nThe Zacks analyst sees Canadian Natural's diverse production mix facilitating long-term value and reducing risk profile but is worried about the company's debt maturities each year out till 2027.\n\nStrong Domestic Demand, Cost Cuts Aid Sherwin-Williams (SHW)\r\nPer the Zacks Analyst, Sherwin-Williams will gain from strong U.S. architectural demand and efforts to cut operating costs.

Also, defense shipments rose 2.4% year over year.\n\nCombining both the segments, Boeing\u2019s total deliveries in the first quarter were 172 units compared with the 136 units delivered in the year-ago period. Such strong delivery numbers are likely to bolster BA\u2019s top line in the first quarter.\n\nCommercial Deliveries Remain a Key Contributor\n\nBoeing reported commercial deliveries of 130 airplanes in the first quarter of 2023, a solid increase from the prior-year tally of 95. This was primarily driven by increased 737 and 787 airplane deliveries.\n\nThe shipments of Boeing 737 totaled 113 compared with 86 in the year-ago period, registering growth of 31.4% year over year. Boeing delivered 11,787 jets in the first quarter, while the same in the year-ago quarter was nil. The company also shipped 4,777 jets in the quarter, one more than the year-ago quarter\u2019s tally.\n\nThe shipment of the 767 model was one compared with five in the previous year\u2019s first-quarter tally. The delivery figure of Boeing 747 was one in the quarter, in line with the last year\u2019s figure.\n\nBoeing vs. Airbus\n\nA comparative analysis of Boeing\u2019s arch-rival Airbus SE\u2019s EADSY commercial shipment indicates that the U.S. jet giant came ahead of Airbus in terms of delivery numbers. EADSY delivered 127 commercial aircraft in the first quarter compared with Boeing\u2019s 130 in the same period.\n\nThe year-over-year growth rate of both companies also tells the same story, with Boeing\u2019s deliveries indicating an improvement of an impressive 36.8%. Meanwhile, Airbus registered a decline of 11%, suggesting that BA is on a better growth trajectory.\n\nDefense Deliveries Up\n\nBoeing reported defense deliveries of 42 airplanes in the first quarter of 2023, reporting an increase by one jet from the prior-year tally.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe shipments of AH-64 Apache (remanufactured) deliveries declined by two jets at 13 compared with the year-ago period\u2019s tally. Meanwhile, the delivery of AH-64 Apache (new) remained steady at seven compared with the year-ago period.\n\nMoreover, the company delivered five CH-47 Chinook (new) jets in the first quarter compared with four in the year-ago quarter. Meanwhile, one CH-47 Chinook (renewed) was delivered in the reported quarter compared with three in the first quarter of 2022.\n\nThe shipments of F-15 Models included two jets compared with one in the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the delivery of the KC-46 Tanker declined by three jets year over year at four, while seven F/A-18 jets were delivered compared with four in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nThe delivery of P-8 models remained unchanged at three from the first-quarter 2022 tally. Three commercial and civil satellites were delivered compared to none in the year-ago quarter.\n\nPeer Prospects\n\nJet makers who are yet to report their delivery numbers are Embraer S.A. ERJ and Textron TXT.\n\nIn the last reported quarter, Embraer delivered 30 commercial and 50 executive (33 light and 17 midsize) jets compared with 10 commercial and 23 executive (15 light and eight mid/super-midsize) jets in the prior quarter.\n\nThe long-term earnings growth rate for Embraer is pegged at 17%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ERJ\u2019s 2023 earnings has been revised upward by 28.7% in the past 60 days.\n\nTextron delivered 52 jets in the fourth quarter of 2022, down from 46 in the year-ago quarter. It also delivered 47 commercial turboprops, up from 43 in the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nThe long-term earnings growth rate for Textron is 11.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for TXT\u2019s 2023 earnings indicates growth of 24.2% from the prior-year reported figure.\n\nPrice Performance\n\nShares of Boeing have rallied 20.4% in the past year against the industry\u2019s decline of 7.7%.

That total included seven of the widebody 787s that have been in high demand from airlines but have experienced repeated delays in the last two years due to manufacturing and regulatory issues.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allowed 787 deliveries to resume in mid-March after a weeks-long pause. However, the regulator has also called on airlines to inspect an issue with leaky bathroom faucets in the 787s that may pose a hazard to the jetliner\u2019s electronics. Boeing and the manufacturer have worked on a fix for the problem and are coordinating retrofits with airlines.\n\nFAA WARNS OF SAFETY HAZARD FROM LEAKY FAUCETS IN BOEING 787, CALLS FOR INSPECTIONS Boeing was permitted to resume deliveries of 787 \"Dreamliners\" like the above in March which helped the American aircraft maker edge out its European rival Airbus.\n\nThe bulk of Boeing\u2019s March deliveries were centered on the smaller 737 MAX jet, with a total of 52 delivered and Southwest Airlines and United Airlines landing a dozen each. It also delivered its first 767 of the year after the company resolved a fuel tank problem, in addition to a trio of 777s.\n\nBoeing received new orders for 60 planes in March and received 22 cancellations, leaving the Arlington, Virginia-based firm with 38 new net orders in March. The new orders consisted of 40 737 MAXs and 20 787s, while the cancellations included 16 MAXs and six 787s.
