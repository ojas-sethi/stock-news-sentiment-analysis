[{"date": "2023-11-13T23:30:00+00:00", "title": "Markets Stay Flat Ahead of CPI Tuesday Morning", "content": "You don\u2019t get much flatter than this, folks. Market indices climbed out of the negative territory we saw in today\u2019s pre-market by mid-day, and just sort of stayed there. The Dow was up +54 points, +0.16%, but this was pulled forward by a strong day from Boeing BA; the S&P 500 dipped -0.08%, the Nasdaq took a few profits, -0.22%, and the small-cap Russell 2000 gained +0.01%.\r\n\r\nThe good news for Boeing came this morning, when it was announced the aerospace giant is selling 125 777X wide-body jets to Emirates Airlines, the Dubai-based company that also owns flyDubai. This deal is reportedly worth $52 billion. (777X jets include both the 777-8 and 777-9 models.) Expectations are for the jets to be delivered in 2025. Aside from gaining +4% in today\u2019s session, Boeing is up +15% from late-October lows for the year.\r\n\r\nOther than this, however, and with most of the marquee names for Q3 earnings season already reported, we\u2019ve been pretty uneventful today \u2014 but for good reason: tomorrow morning brings us October Consumer Price Index (CPI) numbers, one of the most important gauges tracking domestic inflation. Month over month and headline year over year (aka the Inflation Rate) are expected to cool down further, helping bring down inflation the way the Fed intends with elevated interest rate levels.\r\n\r\nPerhaps most important of all may be core CPI year over year, which is expected to remain even with the previous month at +4.1%. This suggests stickier inflation when we strip out volatile food and energy costs, though we have come down considerably over the past 12 months \u2014 from +6.3% in October of last year. Yes, we\u2019re still double where the Fed considers optimum inflation levels, but this steady, gradual move downward is a good indication that the efforts to cool the economy have not (thus far) dragged our economy into recession.\r\n\r\nHome Depot HD reports earnings Tuesday, kicking off Retail Week(s) toward the end of earnings season, and already within the holiday shopping quarter just begun. Target TGT and TJX Companies TJX report in Wednesday, and Walmart WMT, Macy\u2019s M and others are out Thursday. By Friday of this week \u2014 even with another couple weeks or so of earnings season to go \u2014 we should have a good take on where the American consumer is situated going into the end of 2023.\r\n\r\nQuestions or comments about this article and/or author?

The deal is estimated to be worth close to $52 billion. Good news for Boeing. Let's get right over to Akiko Fujita has more on this one. Kiko.\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: Good morning to you, Brian. While the Dubai air show being closely watched as a good gauge for the demand in the airline industry, aviation industry in the face of global economic slowdown. It's also seen as a good gauge for what travel looks like in the region against the backdrop of that war between Israel and Hamas. That order for those wide body 777 jets seen as not just a win for Boeing, but also for Emirates, which faces increasing competition in its own back yard.\n\nYou pointed to those numbers there. Emirates already the largest buyer of those 777 Jets. The airline has not confirmed the number of jets ordered, but Reuters and AP reporting the carriers adding 90 new jets to that fleet and a price tag of roughly $52 billion.\n\nThat is a huge boost in confidence to a Boeing program that has been marred by a lot of delays. We're talking about a delivery now expected in 2025. That is five years later than initially scheduled. Its sister airline, we're talking about Emirates sister airline, FlyDubai, also expected to announce an order here, adding to the total of its own fleet with 30 Boeing, 787-9 Dreamliners. That is worth $11 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nYou see what the stock is doing there in pre-market certainly on the back of these big announcements. We should point out this order comes as Emirates faces increasing competition in its own backyard. Turkish Airlines, its largest competitor, also looking to make its own splash with a reported 355 order for Airbus Jets as part of an overall 600 fleet buy. That was reported by Turkey's state-run news agency over the weekend.\n\nAll of these airlines looking to feed travel demand that has seen a big bounce back since the lows of the pandemic. But we should point out this Dubai air show coming against the backdrop of this ongoing war between Israel and Hamas with no end in sight, there certainly going to be concerns about what that does to demand in the region.\n\nBookings to the Middle East have dropped off 26% since October 7, according to travel firm Forwardkeys. But, guys, the expectation, at least among aviation analysts right now, is that drop off is likely going to be short term. But of course, this all depends on how long that conflict extends.\n\n- Akiko, while we have you, several kind of press releases that have rolled across for Boeing this morning seems like it's already been a pretty successful air show for themselves. Royal Air, Maroc, Royal Jordanian, you've also got FlyDubia ordering 30 Boeing, 787. So a mix of the 787 with the 777 here.\n\nWhat more can we expect for this to be one of the areas perhaps that at least strengthens some of the international business at a time where, yes, you did lay out that there is still this geopolitical conflict and that risk that many CEOs are trying to navigate through?\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: Yeah. Let's put this geopolitical issue aside because there's no way to really gauge how long this extends. Reality is for Boeing, they are looking to really bounce back from the lows in the pandemic. But it's sort of been twofold, as you guys have been reporting out.\n\nBoeing having its own issues with its own program. We're not just talking about the 777, but the Dreamliners as well. That has been extended years out.\n\nSo these orders that have been coming through in the Dubai air show certainly a big boost of confidence. And by the way, this is the second largest air show globally. So that's a big boost of confidence, a big announcement on the part of Boeing being able to rack in some of those orders that have been coming through.\n\nCertainly going to be watching over the next few days to see if any other orders come through as well. But as we pointed out, the Boeing stock up more than 4% pre market.\n\n- Yeah. Investors trying to price this in as best they can, even if those orders are set to be delivered over years and in some cases decades as well.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/video/boeing-stock-soars-52b-emirates-151556683.html", "symbols": ["BA.MX", "BA.US", "BCO.F", "BCO.XETRA", "BOEI34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.997, "neg": 0.033, "neu": 0.858, "pos": 0.109}}, {"date": "2023-11-13T15:13:02+00:00", "title": "US STOCKS-Wall St falls as megacaps drag ahead of inflation data", "content": "(For a Reuters live blog on U.S., UK and European stock markets, click or type LIVE/ in a news window.)\n\n*\n\nCPI, retail sales data due this week\n\n*\n\nBoeing up on report China plans to end 737 deal freeze\n\n*\n\nIndexes down: Dow 0.06%, S&P 0.43%, Nasdaq 0.70%\n\n(Updated at 9:41 a.m. ET/1341 GMT)\n\nBy Sruthi Shankar and Amruta Khandekar\n\nNov 13 (Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes slipped on Monday as investors awaited a crucial inflation reading and other economic data this week that could shape expectations around how long the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates elevated.\n\nMegacap growth stocks were a big drag, as the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yield rose.

Emirates is already the biggest buyer of the massive twin-engine 777X, which sports wingtips that fold to make it easier to fit through airports.\n\nBoeing also scored wins with a narrowbody order for as many as 90 of its top-selling 737 Max jets at Turkey\u2019s SunExpress, and 18 of the model from EgyptAir. The US manufacturer picked up more commitments for the hot-selling 787 widebody, with Royal Jordanian adding a handful of Dreamliners and FlyDubai picking up 30 of the model \u2014 the first time the carrier has bought larger twin-aisle aircraft.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty darn big,\u201d Boeing commercial chief Stan Deal said of the order flow in Dubai. \u201cI\u2019m not counting my chickens yet, and it\u2019s not over. But it\u2019s a big one.\u201d\n\nAirbus talks\n\nAirbus, meanwhile, made do with a midsize A220 narrowbody order from AirBaltic and a confirmation from Turkish Airlines that the two sides are close on a major aircraft order. But there was no megadeal, either from Turkish or from Emirates, as talks around engines supplied by Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc proved to be a sticking point to a deal with the Gulf carrier.\n\nDeal spent much of the day shuttling back and forth between Boeing\u2019s offices at the show, where airline executives and prospective customers mingle to get deals over the line, and the main press center where he announced the accords in rapid succession. Emirates made by far the biggest impact with its top-up order, which massively extends the airline\u2019s already huge backlog of widebody planes.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cDemand for travel on Emirates is one of the strongest it\u2019s ever been in its history,\u201d the airline\u2019s president, Tim Clark, said in an interview. \u201cIf we had those aircraft we ordered today in place tomorrow, we\u2019d fill them up. It\u2019s as strong as that.\u201d\n\nWaiting for planes\n\nBoeing\u2019s haul on the first day pushes it into territory last seen a decade ago, when Emirates placed its first massive order for the 777X. The company\u2019s flagship aircraft has been severely delayed by several years amid certification issues, though Deal said the current timeline that sees an entry into service in 2025 is attainable. A Boeing 777X at the Farnborough International Airshow in 2022. REUTERS/Matthew Childs (Matthew Childs / reuters)\n\nThe action on the first day continues the dominant order pattern this year among airlines rushing to place giant orders as delivery slots become scarce. While that\u2019s translated into ever-longer order books and backlogs for Boeing and Airbus, some industry experts have begun cautioning that not all deals will necessarily make it over the finish line.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a massive amount of activity from airlines to line up slots,\u201d said Steven Udvar-Hazy, who runs Air Lease Corp. and helped place a deal on Monday for EgyptAir for 737 single-aisle Boeings. \u201cTime will tell whether all these aircraft will deliver on time, and whether the airlines that ordered them will be able to absorb them at a later time. It would not be surprising if some of these aircraft would get deferred into a later time frame.\u201d\n\nBoeing\u2019s profitable run contrasts with Airbus\u2019s first day of the show, which turned into a more muted performance. The European planemaker has few available delivery slots, and a tougher negotiating stance by engine supplier Rolls under its new CEO has made it harder to bring widebody deals across the finish line.\n\nOver the weekend, Airbus looked to have the upper hand touting a giant order from Turkish Airlines for close to 350 aircraft. The accord hasn\u2019t materialize at the event, though Airbus and its customer confirmed that they\u2019d reached an accord in principle, with final details still be hashed out.\n\nAn order from Emirates, which likes to balance its fleet between the two main rivals, was also elusive for Airbus on the first day. Emirates has said that it\u2019s in the market for more widebody aircraft, including Airbus aircraft. But Clark signaled that talks with Rolls remain a sticking point.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve still got to get over the last jump for the commercial terms of this, and we have to get through some of the engine issues that exist at the moment,\u201d Clark said.\n\nTalks with China\n\nMore good news, meanwhile, beckons for Boeing as it emerges from several years of shaky performance and makes strides in regaining the trust of major customers like Emirates. The new agreement brings the Gulf carrier\u2019s commitment to the 777X to 205 planes, giving the program a shot of support after years of delays.\n\nBoeing has also made progress in its effort to open the door to further jet sales in China.

The new order, which increases Emirates' 777X family backlog to 205 planes, was announced during the Dubai Airshow at a signing event attended by His Highness Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, Chairman and Chief Executive, Emirates Airline and Group; and Stan Deal, president and CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes. Boeing and Emirates announced today that the world\u2019s largest 777 operator has placed an order for 90 777X airplanes, including 55 777-9 and 35 777-8 jets.\n\nIn addition, Emirates updated its 787 Dreamliner order book to better align future capacity to demand. The airline is buying five more 787 jets \u2013 growing its 787 backlog to 35 \u2013 while converting 30 787-9s to 20 787-8 and 10 787-10 airplanes.\n\n\"Emirates is the biggest operator of Boeing 777 aircraft, and today's order cements that position,\" said HH Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, Chairman and Chief Executive, Emirates Airline and Group. \"We've been closely involved in the 777 program since its start up until this latest generation of 777X aircraft. The 777 has been central to Emirates' fleet and network strategy of connecting cities on all continents non-stop to Dubai. We are pleased to extend our relationship with Boeing and look forward to the first 777-9 joining our fleet in 2025.\"\n\nBoeing's relationship with Emirates dates back to the airline's first 777 order in 1992. Today, Emirates has nearly 150 777 jets in its fleet. Based on the most successful twin-aisle airplane ever, the 777, the 777X family is designed to maximize efficiency and environmental performance by 25%, while providing an exceptional onboard experience.\n\n\"This order is an incredible vote of confidence in Boeing's highly efficient widebody family and the versatility of our 777X and 787 airplanes to meet Emirates' needs for global long-haul travel,\" said Stan Deal, president and CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes. \"The 777-9 and 777-8 are the perfect airplanes to support Emirates' growth, improving environmental performance and unmatched payload capability along the way.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nThe 777-9 will be the largest and most fuel-efficient twin-engine jet in the world, with the lowest operating cost per seat of any commercial airplane. Opening new growth opportunities for airlines, the 777-9 seats 426 passengers in a typical two-class configuration, with a range of 13,510 km (7,295 nautical miles).\n\nThe 777-8 seats 395 passengers with a range capability of up to 16,190 km (8,745 nautical miles). The 777-8 also offers airlines more revenue potential through more payload and improved fuel efficiency on short and long flights.\n\nThe 777X family also provides unmatched passenger comfort with a wider cabin and interiors that provide better humidity levels, a smoother ride and more natural light.\n\nThe 787 is the industry's most versatile widebody jet, operating with superior efficiency and comfort across all network segments. The enhanced efficiency and performance of the 787 family reduce fuel use and emissions by up to 25% compared to today's similarly sized airplanes. Passengers enjoy a better experience with the largest windows of any jet, air that is more humid and pressurized at a lower cabin altitude for greater comfort, and technology that senses and counters turbulence for a smoother ride.\n\nBoeing's 2023 Commercial Market Outlook forecasts widebody airplanes will comprise 45% of deliveries to Middle East airlines over the next 20 years \u2500 the highest regional percentage worldwide. Many airlines in the region provide service between major global population centers and as a result, a higher proportion of widebody aircraft are needed to carry larger passenger volumes.\n\nAs a leading global aerospace company, Boeing develops, manufactures and services commercial airplanes, defense products and space systems for customers in more than 150 countries.

The company had said that as of the end of June, about 90% of its 737 Max jets in China had resumed commercial operations.\n\nThe company has been all but shut out of new orders from Chinese carriers since 2017 amid rising political and trade tensions between Beijing and Washington.\n\nBoeing in September slightly increased its annual 20-year forecast for new plane deliveries to China, citing economic growth and increasing demand for domestic travel.\n\nThe U.S. planemaker said that China's fleet would more than double to nearly 9,600 jets over the next 20 years and that its domestic aviation market would be the largest in the world by the end of the forecast period, with demand for 6,470 single-aisle planes such as the Boeing 737 MAX family.\n\nReuters reported in April that China's aviation regulator published a report that Boeing viewed as a key step for the U.S. planemaker to resume deliveries, but none have resumed.\n\nBoeing declined to comment on the Bloomberg report.\n\n(Reporting by Gokul Pisharody in Bengaluru; Editing by Tom Hogue and Gerry Doyle)", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-weighs-ending-freeze-boeing-021535201.html", "symbols": ["BA.MX", "BA.US", "BCO.F", "BCO.XETRA", "BOEI34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.251, "neg": 0.023, "neu": 0.944, "pos": 0.033}}, {"date": "2023-11-13T00:00:00+00:00", "title": "BA Stock Alert: The $52 Billion Reason Boeing Is Up Today", "content": "Boeing stock is rising on Monday as investors in BA react to the company signing a $52 million deal for its 777-X widebody jets.", "link": "https://investorplace.com/2023/11/ba-stock-alert-the-52-billion-reason-boeing-is-up-today/", "symbols": ["BA.US"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0, "neg": 0, "neu": 1, "pos": 0}}, {"date": "2023-11-12T21:55:10+00:00", "title": "UPDATE 1-Looming Emirates 777X deal to kick-start Dubai Airshow -sources", "content": "(Adds context on delays in paragraph 4, analyst quote in paragraph 7)\n\nBy Tim Hepher and Alexander Cornwell\n\nDUBAI, Nov 13 (Reuters) - Middle East carriers look set to order tens of billions of dollars of long-haul jets at the opening of the Dubai Airshow on Monday, as Emirates renews confidence in the delayed Boeing 777X while facing new competition from rivals like Turkish Airlines.\n\nHosts Emirates and low-cost cousin flyDubai are expected to stamp their mark early on the world's second-largest aerospace event, industry sources said, despite concerns about a drop in the economically key travel sector due to Mideast tensions.\n\nThat includes a new order for several dozen Boeing 777X jets, they said, in a boost for the programme amid ongoing uncertainty over the schedule for the world's largest twin-engined jet, currently expected in 2025 after a five-year delay.\n\nPeople familiar with the flagship programme have said the risks are weighted toward further delays as Boeing first gauges the impact of tighter certification rules on other projects.

The region's fleet of dedicated freighters is projected to more than double to 180 jets by 2042, according to the CMO, Boeing's annual long-term forecast of demand for commercial airplanes and services.\n\n\"Airlines in the Middle East have increasingly expanded their influence and reach, transforming the region into an international air transit hub,\" said Darren Hulst, Boeing vice president, Commercial Marketing. \"Air travel and cargo demand continue to gain momentum, driven by significant economic growth and national development plans. As airlines in the region will require efficient and versatile fleet solutions, Boeing products will be ready to meet market demands.\"\n\nThe CMO projects delivery of 3,025 new commercial airplanes in the Middle East by 2042, including 1,350 widebodies. Many airlines in the region provide service between major population centers in Asia, Africa and Europe via growing hubs that offer efficient connectivity. As a result, a higher proportion of widebody aircraft are needed to carry larger passenger volumes.\n\nThe Middle East single-aisle fleet is also expected to more than double as low-cost carriers (LCC) and short-haul networks continue to develop\u00a0and expand. By 2042, nearly half of the region's aircraft will be single-aisle jets.\n\nAdditional 2023 CMO highlights for the Middle East through 2042 include:\n\nTwo-thirds of new deliveries will support air traffic and cargo growth while one-third of deliveries will replace older airplanes with more fuel-efficient models The total fleet will increase 2.4 times to 3,360 airplanes \u2014 1,610 (48%) will be single aisles, while 1,520 (45%) will be widebodies The commercial fleet will generate demand for $335 billion in aviation services including maintenance, repair, training and spare parts\n\nStory continues\n\nCommercial airplane deliveries to the Middle East (2023-2042) Regional Jet 35 Single Aisle 1,570 Widebody 1,350 Freighter 70 Total 3,025\n\nRecent orders and deliveries in the region:\n\nIraqi Airways Celebrates Delivery of its First Boeing 787 Dreamliner (Jun. 22, 2023) SAUDIA to Grow Long-Haul Fleet with up to 49 Boeing 787 Dreamliners (March 14, 2023) New Saudi Arabian Carrier Riyadh Air to Launch with All-Boeing Fleet of up to 72 787-9 Dreamliners(March 14, 2023)\n\nBoeing has published the CMO annually since 1961.
