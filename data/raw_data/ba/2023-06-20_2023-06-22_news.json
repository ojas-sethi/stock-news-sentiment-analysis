I\u2019m Alan Murray.\n\nMichal Lev-Ram: And I\u2019m Michal Lev-Ram. Alan in the last month we've had quite a few CEOs on Leadership Next who have led their companies through some pretty extraordinary challenges. One was Ed Bastian of Delta, who was at the helm of the major airline during the pandemic, during the bankruptcy, even 9/11. Another being Emma Walmsley, who led GSK through a de-merger, sounds like a lot of fun, while some investors and activists were calling for her resignation. And then of course, we had Brian Cornell on just recently, who joined Target at a really low point for the retailer and he's turned it around. So we've got yet another turnaround CEO on the show today, one who you've written about yourself.\n\nMurray: Yeah, that's right, Michal. Today's interview is with Dave Calhoun, who took over as CEO of Boeing in January of 2020, when the aircraft manufacturer was really in crisis. I mean, this is before the pandemic hit, but they had had two planes that had crashed the, the 737 Max catastrophes, and a real contentious back-and-forth with the public and the press over why they crashed. It was a very ugly moment for Boeing.\n\nLev-Ram: I thought he was such a straight shooter about it all. I'm sure it wasn't easy dealing with the press back then. And vice versa, obviously. But it was really interesting hearing his approach, not only overhauling the internal culture of Boeing, but also the company's entire safety protocol, which clearly needed to happen. And this was literally a life or death ask.\n\nMurray: One of our writers asked him, \"Is this the toughest job in America?\" I think at that moment in time it might have been, but Dave has done a lot to right the company, and it hasn't been easy. He's had some pretty serious supply chain problems to deal with, which are still plaguing the company and still causing delays in delivery of airplanes that people have ordered.\n\nLev-Ram: Yeah, I think he semi-jokingly says that he just wants things to be boring again, like that's probably the goal for you know, this industry.\n\nMurray: Go boring.\n\nLev-Ram: Yeah, go boring, we want more boring. But, you know, he got into how the company has changed over the past few years. I think it's important also, at the same time, you know, as we're talking about this turnaround, to point out just how big Boeing is, because that obviously makes steering and righting the ship even harder. So alongside their competitor, Airbus, they make up a duopoly, as we all know, on the aircraft manufacturer market, and Boeing has both a commercial and a military arm. As of late 2022 it was the third largest defense contractor.\n\nMurray: Yeah, the other thing that's interesting about Dave Calhoun is that he was one of a string of corporate leaders who were prot\u00e9g\u00e9e of the of the late Jack Welch, when he was CEO of General Electric, which is now more than two decades ago. And I always think, looking back at Jack Welch, how dramatically corporate leadership has changed in the two decades since he left the scene. We talk about that with Dave in this podcast.\n\nLev-Ram: Yeah, loved your question about that. It was a really fascinating conversation about leadership, about the industry, in particular transforming company culture. And we are excited to bring it all to you. So here's Dave Calhoun, CEO of Boeing.\n\n[Music. Interview begins.]\n\nLev-Ram: Dave, thanks so much for joining us. I know you've seen some challenges in a short amount of time. But let's get started with perhaps the biggest challenge that you faced when you became CEO of Boeing, back in January 2020. And I know there was another one coming down the pipeline very, very quickly. We'll get to that. But there was a complete reevaluation of the safety of Boeing's aircrafts after the fatal crashes of the two Boeing 737 Maxes, and we want to start with that. I know it's a it's a big topic. But what has changed since, in the past three years? And what due to those challenges were some of the toughest decisions that you had to make right off the bat as CEO?\n\nDave Calhoun: Well, it was the toughest moment course I've ever seen in my career, and even with a long history and background in aerospace by virtue of my GE days. Yeah, this was a sort of a situation that was as tough as it gets. I might as well start from my perspective as a board member. Living through the period of time post the second crash where we had already grounded the fleet. So that on one hand, we knew there would be no forward safety concerns. It would give us time to evaluate the leadership and management system that oversaw all of this without taking additional safety risk. On the other hand, we also knew we had to be incredibly decisive. Otherwise, the population that we employ everywhere in the world and our customers would lose faith. So we knew there was a clock running. We had a plan with respect to decisive action, if we needed to do it, I was that plan. We had sort of three successive moments post the second crash where the leadership team had discerned the issue with respect to those particular accidents, and had worked with the FAA to recertify that airplane so that we could again get back into the business of delivering airplanes. And they kept predicting every three months that the cert would be in hand and then we missed on our third. And that is when the board decided it had to move and move quickly. In moving quickly, everybody knows when you have to make a leadership change, sometimes that in and of itself, especially if you don't know who's coming, is going to take time. In our case, this took us about three weeks. So I knew that I would have to close up shop at my existing employer, which I loved, and get into this and get into it quickly. With respect to what I found. You know, the, the issue with respect to the Max, our relationship with the FAA, the most important two elements of that were going to be stop predicting when the FAA would ultimately discover for themselves when the airplane would be recertified because that is their right and we should not try to jump ahead of them in any way, shape, or form. And then secondly, be transparent with literally everything, no matter how uncomfortable the data is or the conversation is, you have to tell everybody, everything, including the media, and you're gonna get whacked along the way and that's life. But for us to regain trust, number one with our own people, and then two the flying public, they were going to have to believe that that was us and that was the culture we were going to carry forward.\n\nMurray: Dave, at some point, we should do a separate podcast on why in March of 2019, you said yes. Because this was one hell of a big challenge that you were taking on. But let me ask you, I mean, I feel like cultural problems are the biggest, most difficult problems that a CEO has to deal with. So let me ask you, first of all, do you buy the critique that Boeing had a fundamental culture problem in March of 2019, that it was prioritizing quarterly profits over safety? And if not, what was the culture problem?\n\nCalhoun: You know, Alan, we had a, we had a culture problem. I'll characterize it quite a bit differently then the media liked to characterize it. The idea that anybody, any human being makes a trade of quarterly profits over safety is just a that's a flawed notion. Like who can do that? Who can look in a mirror and say, Hey, let's compromise safety today? Right? It's just not what happens. What I do think I found was an organization and a company, a culture that was having a hard time being honest with one another, about where programs stood, how much time was required, what things still needed to get completed. And as a result, you know, leadership became disconnected with the ground troops. And that can never happen. It can never happen. As you know, I've seen big companies, I know how that can break up. But the role of leadership in that particular aspect to me is paramount. And we had lost that. We had lost that. I think the symptom, the notion that we could every three months predict we'd have a success cert with an FAA regulator who is looking at everything all the time, and our own people submitting documents and suffering inquiry, without talking to them, that's how you get that's how you create these problems. Every three months, we're gonna get it. Why? Because some, somebody mastermind has a critical path? No, that's not that's not what it takes. The culture has to be willing to talk about what it's facing and the difficulties it's facing. Getting back to that transparent relationship across the company to me was the biggest cultural upside that I could bring.\n\nLev-Ram: Rebuilding that trust internally and externally, and the role that transparency plays, I wonder if you can talk a little bit more about that, and just where that comes for you? I know we'll get into your years at GE a little bit later. But I think it's just fascinating, the difficulty that even leaders in very top positions have with difficult conversations. And you know, you said you knew you'd get whacked along the way but that this was the the best approach. So is that something that you developed over time? Is that something that you're developing in other leaders at Boeing? And how do you do that?\n\nCalhoun: You know, in the world of and particularly in public governance and public companies and the quarterly focus and the desire to always have good news about everything, CEOs are particularly impacted by that. They have to be. Because they always want to present a way forward for everybody. Investors are paramount, but also their employees, etc. So if you let that get carried away and it stops you from reconciling what are more difficult circumstances on the ground with what you would like to project and then you compromise that delicate balance, that's what gets you in trouble. You know, I, I worked for a guy, Alan, you remember him well, Jack Welsh. The one thing you could count on from Jack was pure reality and pure clarity every step of the way. He told you everything he thought about you, about your business, what he heard from the people he visited with at Crotonville the day before, he just went at it. He happened to be sharp and good and he kept us ahead of that game. I grew up in that situation and it just became really important to me. I carried that into my Nielsen life. That whole idea around transparency, how people's confidence grows, when they're confident they can be transparent. And then that hit me right between the eyeballs when I got to Boeing in the CEO role. And yes, I talk about it. There's not a day goes by I don't use the word. I talk about it at the top. I talk about it at the bottom of the organization. I create expectations in the media and with investors that they're not going to like what they hear in many cases. We talk about every little problem that occurs inside our production facility. It creates issues for our regulator. It creates issues with our investor. Our customers appreciate it. They really appreciate it. And we're on that journey.\n\n[Music starts]\n\nMurray: Jason Girzadas, the CEO of Deloitte US is the sponsor of this podcast and joins me today. Welcome, Jason.\n\nJason Girzadas: Thank you, Alan. It's great to be here.\n\nMurray: Jason, everyone in business is talking about A.I. It clearly has the potential to dramatically disrupt almost every industry, but a lot of companies are struggling. What are some of the barriers that companies are facing in creating business value with A.I.?\n\nGirzadas: Yeah, Alan, I think A.I. is on every client\u2019s agenda. I think every CEO and board interaction and conversation that I\u2019m a part of proves the fact that the promise of A.I. is widely held, and the hope is far and deep that it creates business value. But there\u2019s challenges to be sure. What we\u2019ve seen is that the probability of success increases dramatically with strong executive sponsorship and leadership. There has to be a portfolio of investments around A.I., as well as to link the business ownership with technology leadership to see the value of A.I.-related investments. Over time, we\u2019re optimistic and confident that the value will result, but it will be a portfolio where either short-term opportunities for automation improvements around productivity and cost takeout and then longer-term, medium-term opportunities for business model innovation that are truly transformational. So this is a classic case where it won\u2019t be a single approach that realizes value for A.I.\n\nMurray: It sounds like you take it a step at a time.\n\nGirzadas: I think it\u2019s definitely time, and also a portfolio recognizing that some investments will have short-term benefit where you can see immediate use cases creating financial and business impact, but longer-term opportunities to really invent different customer experiences, different business models, and ultimately create a longer-term benefit that we can\u2019t even fully appreciate at this point in time.\n\nMurray: Jason, thanks for your perspective. And thanks for sponsoring Leadership Next.\n\nGirzadas: Thank you.\n\n[Music ends]\n\nMurray: You took on Boeing in March of 2019, when you had a serious problem with the 737 Max crashes. And then in March of 2020, on top of that, you had a global pandemic and serious supply chain challenges that have really held the company back for the last few years, just getting the parts in place. And you know, you said, some of your customers, you talk turkey with your customers, you tell them exactly what's going on. But they're not terribly happy about it. They don't like the delays. They don't like the fact that they can't get their new planes in place, particularly when when travel is is booming. Have you gotten beyond the supply chain challenges? Where are you in that part of the journey?\n\nCalhoun: No, no, we haven't gotten by them. Our industry has not gotten by them. Maybe to reflect on the immediacy with which COVID came on top of our Max issue. I mean, both of them ended up being existential in their own right. But largely because they were dependent on each other. So we couldn't supply and now all of a sudden nobody wanted them. So we're sort of faced with, Oh, my gosh. The supply chain issues in aerospace, and I use that term to define the industry, I think really relate to the demographic issue the industry has had for quite some time. Our demographics have been working against us for quite a while. We have a lot of incredibly experienced engineers at every level of the value chain. So yes, Boeing at the design and assembly level, but also every single one of our supply chain participants, many of which are sole source, because remember, we only make what, a couple 1000 of these things a year? So you can't have two or three sources for every part that goes on two or 3000 airplanes. So it is a highly fragmented supply chain. With that demographic issue who had to face into cutbacks during the COVID moments and now is in the process of rebuilding. It's rarely now a story of can I get the people? It's can I train the people? Can I get them up to speed where all my experienced engineers who may have decided to retire, can I get them up to speed fast enough? They're not, I don't typically run into, we don't typically run into physical capacity constraints. It's technical constraints amongst the leading and best engineers in that supply chain. And it's impacting both manufacturers. So that, yeah, maybe you can relax for a minute that it's not just you. On the other hand, it means our industry is likely to be supply constrained for quite some time.\n\nLev-Ram: Well, so what does that timeline look like do you think if it's if it's more of a training issue? That sounds like that could take a while.\n\nCalhoun: My view is it takes roughly two years, starting at the beginning of this year, to get through our supply chains' capability capacity to then meet the demands of myself and the other player. It will then take, based on the demand that we see now, probably three more years for us to get to real rates that satisfy reasonably current demand, maybe three years worth of demand. Right now, we're out there selling 567 years from now.\n\nLev-Ram: So, and a follow up question there, because Boeing, of course, has both commercial and military businesses, but I'm assuming the supply chain issues impact both and there's, you know, yes, people need to get to Paris and wherever they want to go for vacation, but I'm assuming the military implications of a backlog there, there is slightly higher stakes, right?\n\nCalhoun: Higher stakes, but it's exactly the same issue that we face, many common shared suppliers. And I think if you survey my counterparts across the defense side, you get exactly the same response.\n\nMurray: You know, one of the problems in this industry is that the your customers are dependent on either you or Airbus. They really only have two choices. I think we saw some news this morning that the Chinese are trying to give them a third choice. Are you worried that this delay will give a big leg up to your competition?\n\nCalhoun: No, I'm not. I do believe patience is virtue in this industry, and it always has been. And a long term outlook is a big advantage if you can keep it. So we have two guys, and you're right, we've been at it for quite a long time. Relative parity, we enjoy some advantages in wide bodies, they enjoy some advantages in the narrow body. But basically parity from my point of view. New airplanes get introduced about every 10 years, and I think about 10 years from now we'll see new airplanes come to the market. The 919 as you mentioned, Alan, was introduced this morning. It's going to be a capable airplane. I don't think it can compete in the West yet with with Airbus and Boeing. But do I discount that they will eventually? No, they will. And then I ask myself the question: In 2050, if all the regulators in the world move in their direction for all the right reasons, and they're able to ramp up production at rates commensurate with what maybe Airbus or Boeing had done in their heydays, where would we be in 2050? And the answer is not the most devastating answer in the world. It's a growing market. It will continue to grow from now until 2050. There'll be three players instead of two. Two will have reasonably dominant chairs, and one will probably have 10% to 15% if everything goes right. And I look at my peers in industry, and as you know, coming from GE with so many different industrial interests, three competitors and a growing global market of this size and scale should not intimidate anyone.\n\nMurray: Yeah, yeah. So if this were a drinking game, and we had to take a drink every time you mentioned GE or Jack Welch, we would all be getting a little tipsy by now. So let me, Michal, if I can let me dive into...\n\nLev-Ram: It's not even noon in California, so I'm not there quite yet.\n\nMurray: So let me dive into that one and ask you about Jack Welch. And remember that at Fortune, we were all in. I mean, we named the man manager of the century for the 20th century. And certainly candor and transparency was one of his hallmarks straight from the gut, as his book was called. But there are other parts of the Jack Welch legacy that have not aged as well. The smoothing of quarterly earnings. The kind of rank and yank, not Jack's term, but the rank and yank method of, you know, hiring people at the bottom of the ratings distribution. The notion that there is no such thing as a work-life balance. It feels like the world of management has changed dramatically in the 20 years or 23 years since he stepped down, and I wonder how you feel about that?\n\nCalhoun: Again, it's a different time and a different context. Leaders have to change and adapt to the circumstances that we're faced with and we do. But then I ask the question, do I think Jack would have adapted and lead in those changing circumstances as well as he did back then? I think the answer is yes. Because one of the things he did really, really well is keep a pulse on what was going on around him and he always found a way to stay ahead of the game. Did I like quarterly gotta make it, period? No, I never did. I still don't. I have never used it in my subsequent career. And by the way, he knew that. It's just, uh, you know, for me, I don't like managing around edges and I didn't think it was necessary even at GE. I think there were moments when we may have had breakout opportunity. So I just do it a little differently. But do I disrespect and or fault him as that some major, you know, shortcoming? Answer is no. That was the way he coped with managing a incredibly diverse set of businesses and simplify the communication with his investors.\n\nLev-Ram: Before we let you go, Dave, I wanted to end on a, I guess, another culture question really. And just going back to the the crises that you stepped into, multiple crises, and given the competition that is out there and the supply chain issues and everything that you're up against, how do you kind of get things back to boring, in a way, to just working? To making sure that you know, manufacturing, that, that all of these things are ticking along as as they should be, and especially in this industry, while at the same time making sure that you're driving your employees to innovate, to compete? So many different technologies out there. Sustainability obviously is a big issue these days. So how do you strike that balance and make sure that you're setting the right tone culture-wise going forward?\n\nCalhoun: Yeah, I try to divide the world into two things. One is how we deliver and service the airplanes that we know how to build. That's all things supply chain. And I use the word stability and predictability all the time. That's our goal, stability and predictability. It may sound boring, but right now, every customer in a global aviation world would celebrate that moment. So that's the way we talk about it. And then the other dimension of our company, that we are heavily invested in, is development. How do we develop the technologies and capabilities that will then create that next new airplane? We have to sustain the investment, we have to keep our people motivated. And I always say, if you just want to inventory the landscape, we have three major commercial airplanes in development as we speak yet to be certified. Two in the Max family, one in the 777 family, all of which incredibly competitive, incredibly strong. We have a defense portfolio that has two autonomous players. One that is a refueling tanker for the Navy, the other one is a teamer and both of those airplanes fly today, autonomously. And if you could see the tasks that they take on, it would blow your mind. And I can't even talk about the classified programs we've been involved with. For all of these years, throughout every minute of these downturns and existential moments, we never stopped investing, we didn't shortchange any of them. And all of them have incredible promises we move forward. So we just talk about it in those ways. And I have to admit, until we got recertified on the Max, until we restarted our 87 production line, and started prancing our way back or marching our way back to that stability and predictability, it was hard to talk about development. But I'm incredibly proud of all the things that we've done to sustain that throughout this period. And so I would suggest everyone maybe ask our competitor what they're doing on this, and match it up against this.\n\nMurray: We will do that. One more quick question. One more quick question: How long is it going to be before you can produce an airplane that doesn't contribute to carbon pollution?\n\nCalhoun: Well, I think as an industry, the goal of 2050 will be challenged. But we can make so much progress against that with technologies we know we can get. Almost all of it is built around sustainable aviation fuels. As you may know, most of the engines today that get delivered on new airplanes are capable of running on sustainable fuels. We have a lot of formulations of sustainable fuels. And what it's going to boil down to are the feedstocks, feedstocks that support those fuels. And can aviation, we only represent 2% of global emissions, in carbon, 2%, will it be prioritized over other uses of those feedstocks? That's really where the battle is. We need policymakers to help us. But I do like our chances. I really do. Whether we get all the way to net zero at 2050 I'm not sure. Hydrogen will not be ready. Hydrogen might contribute significantly in the second half of the century. Won't be this one. Electric will help us at the low end. It will replace loud, noisy, inefficient high-emission helicopters. But it won't make a big dent in the overall carbon emission numbers.\n\nLev-Ram: Well, Dave, we appreciate the real talk. I personally find it very refreshing. I don't know about you, Alan.\n\nMurray: No, no, it's straight from the gut. I like it. Thank you for your candor.\n\nCalhoun: Well, Michal, I enjoyed it. Thank you. Nice to meet you. Alan, I'm not sure who refers to Jack more\u2014you or me.\n\nMurray: Thank you.\n\nMurray: Leadership Next is edited and produced by Alexis Haut. Our theme is by Jason Snell.

For airlines it can mean a key source of extra profit on the sale.\n\nSuch financing now makes up 34% of all aircraft financing, Airbus said in a presentation to investors on Wednesday.\n\nIndia's leasing market is facing some pressure, however, after the bankruptcy of carrier GoFirst sparked a dispute over lessors' rights. IndiGo Chief Executive Pieter Elbers said he was not concerned about an impact on the wider market.\n\nThe latest deals, coming after a number of mainly Boeing orders before the show, left the largest planemakers mostly sold out until the latter part of the decade.\n\nA key focus of the show was how those planes will be produced after the pandemic disrupted supply chains. Another was hiring more workers: to be tackled in a special event on Friday.\n\nAs their biennial jamboree wound up under pouring rain on Thursday, delegates also had to absorb news of a strike at a Spirit Aero Systems factory that makes Boeing 737 fuselages. A lengthy stoppage would impact suppliers worldwide.\n\nSeveral major companies said they had built up more buffer stocks and were seeing signs of improvement in supply chains.\n\nThe conflict in Ukraine brought a raft of air defence order announcements and a growing focus on Europe's patchy growth in defence spending after years of budgets constraints.\n\nFor many, the show diverted attention from the plush chalets where planemakers keep count of orders to the crowded supplier halls where more of the industry's risk now resides.\n\n\"It was the most interesting European air show for a decade,\" Agency Partners analyst Sash Tusa said.\n\n\"The newsflow was much more balanced between defence and civil - and no longer just a counting competition.\" (Reporting by Tim Hepher Editing by Mark Potter)", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/orders-supply-chain-progress-paris-152556833.html", "symbols": ["BA.MX", "BA.US", "BCO.F", "BCO.XETRA", "BOEI34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.989, "neg": 0.028, "neu": 0.879, "pos": 0.093}}, {"date": "2023-06-22T13:47:03+00:00", "title": "Midday movers: Spirit Aerosystems, Overstock, Amazon.com and more", "content": "Investing.com -- Stocks are mixed after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell repeated his call that interest rates would likely rise again this year.

(Photo: Shutterstock/John Gress Media Inc.)\n\nFedEx plans to remove 29 aircraft from its fleet this year through permanent retirement and temporary storage, fulfilling its new program to eliminate permanent costs and make its logistics network more flexible as global trade slows.\n\nCEO Raj Subramaniam said on Tuesday\u2019s earnings briefing that the Express unit will park 20 aircraft in fiscal year 2024 and permanently retire nine additional MD-11 freighters. But the latest fleet statistics show the integrated logistics and parcel carrier\u2019s mainline fleet will actually grow by 10 aircraft this year as Boeing planes ordered years ago are delivered.\n\nFedEx Express retired 18 aircraft in the just-completed fiscal year, including 12 MD-11s, four Boeing 757-200s and two Airbus A300-600s. FedEx wrote off the $70 million book value of the planes plus 34 related engines in its fourth-quarter results.\n\nFedEx (NYSE: FDX) began flying less in October as part of a corporate restructuring aimed at improving efficiency and reducing immediate costs as the downturn in shipping and e-commerce sales took hold.\n\nExpress revenues fell 13% in the fourth quarter, ended May 31, to $10.4 billion while operating income was halved at $430 million. Success in decreasing expenses and higher U.S. yields partially offset lower volumes and helped improve profits, which tumbled 64% for the full year. The company said Express package volumes declined 7%, an improvement from the third quarter.\n\nSince fall, the company\u2019s in-house airline has slashed dozens of daily flights from its schedule, accelerated the retirement of aging aircraft and deactivated other aircraft until demand picks up. Management has also indicated it plans to rely more heavily on partner airlines in the future instead of purchasing capacity itself to improve cash flow and prioritizing owned aircraft for parcel shipments over heavy freight, which will be moved more by third parties.\n\nFedEx reduced global flight hours by 12%, year over year, during the fourth quarter. Domestic aircraft utilization is down even more, according to a recent analysis by Morgan Stanley.\n\n\u201cWe continue to make significant progress in taking cost out of our network, delivering a $2 billion year-over-year reduction in operating cost in the fourth quarter of FY \u201923. This included more effectively matching flying with demand, marking the first quarter of this year where our flight hours declined more than the underlying volumes,\u201d said Subramaniam.\n\nThe express delivery company decommissioned its few remaining MD-10-30 cargo jets in December. Those planes were taken off the accounting books at the end of fiscal year 2022 but were utilized a few months longer because FedEx was still anticipating continued strong demand midway through last year.\n\nOverall fleet size decreased during the fiscal year by 10 units, with retirements offset by the addition of 14 factory-built Boeing 767-300 freighters and two Boeing 777s. FedEx currently has 700 aircraft, including 407 mainline aircraft and 293 feeder aircraft \u2014 14 more than the prior year.\n\nDecisions on aircraft acquisitions were made years ago, well before the current financial pressures forced FedEx to rebalance its network and consolidate Express and Ground operations to better utilize existing infrastructure and personnel. The fleet additions are mostly for fleet modernization as they will replace aircraft being retired.\n\nFedEx currently has 46 MD-11s, which will be phased out by fiscal 2028.\n\nDuring the next two years, FedEx plans to add 55 aircraft to its fleet, the majority of them small feeder aircraft operated by contractors. It will get rid of 18 MD-11s, while adding 24 767s and six 777s, 27 all-new Cessna 408 SkyCourier aircraft, and 16 ATR72-600s, barring production delays.\n\nThe Cessnas and ATRs are small turbo-prop planes. FedEx has committed to buying 41 SkyCouriers and 17 ATR72s.\n\nAfter fiscal year 2025, FedEx has no firm commitments for aircraft purchases.

Standing at a small booth among a row of other Japanese aerospace suppliers at the Paris Airshow, Yoko Konno is excited at the prospect of new orders for her company, but frowns at long delays to get titanium and the rising cost of chemicals.\n\n\"It is challenging but it is a chance to get more business,\" said Konno, a section manager at Japan's Asahi Kinzoku Kogyo, Inc, which produces components and does chrome plating.\n\nFar from the fighter-jet displays and blockbuster plane orders that grabbed headlines at the world's largest air show this week, it's the small and medium-sized suppliers dotting the sprawling exhibition halls that are garnering big attention from senior aerospace officials.\n\nWhile bosses at Airbus and Raytheon Technologies see improvements, labor shortages and delays are expected to remain a key concern for planemakers and large suppliers for more than a year.\n\n\"There are issues and lack of capacity almost everywhere,\" said Anne Brachet, executive vice president of Air France-KLM's engineering and maintenance division.\n\nThe show is a test of the supply chain's resilience, with some small and medium suppliers both hurting from higher costs and seeing opportunities as large players look for more sources to make parts and components to reduce risk.\n\nOthers are wary of making investments in new production without assurances that clients will stick around.\n\n\"It's chaos, but everyone's in the same boat,\" said Liam Wiezak, business development manager at Britain's Sigma Aero about the supply chain.\n\nIt's raising concerns whether jetmakers Airbus and Boeing will be able to hit ambitious goals to ramp up output in order to meet delivery targets, particularly after the show saw orders for almost 1,000 jets from just two Indian carriers.\n\n\"Headlines may be dominated by news of record new orders but this is all but irrelevant in the short-medium term,\" said Louis Knight, analyst at research firm Third Bridge.\n\n\"The bottlenecks, lead times, sourcing challenges and labor shortages continue to plague the industry, so - regardless of order intake - deliveries remain in full focus.\"\n\nSigma Aero is seeing higher demand for the pipes, ducts and machines it produces for engines and airframes, but the time needed to buy certain raw materials has more than tripled, Wiezak said on the sidelines of the show.\n\nMATERIALS, LABOR\n\nFollowing the war in Ukraine, planemakers are trying to find alternatives to Russia's VSMPO-Avisma, a key titanium producer to the aerospace industry, which is pushing up demand and creating long waits to buy from other providers.\n\n\"Now all the people who used to buy from Russia are shopping in our store,\" said Nik Delic, president of New England Airfoil Products (NEAP) in Connecticut, which purchases U.S.-made titanium.\n\nVSMPO, for example, is the sole source of particular high-strength titanium landing gear, despite increasing production from American, Chinese and Japanese mills, Knight said.\n\n\"While its market share may be reduced, it is very hard for the likes of Airbus, Boeing, and (engine maker) Safran to remove the dependency.\"\n\nPurchasing new machines would increase capacity to meet higher demand for the company's airfoils used in engine compressors, but Delic wants a long-term commitment from buyers.\n\n\"I have 100 people whose livelihood depends on the success of the company.\"\n\nIn certain cases, it takes longer to get parts or materials due to some suppliers exiting aerospace during the pandemic.\n\nDCM Group in Canada's Quebec produces parts welded from sheet metal which mostly need protective coatings.\n\nBut that segment of the industry is under stress because some companies have closed their doors since COVID-19, said Guillaume Gasparri, executive vice president, business development, for DCM.\n\nLike parts and materials, a shortfall of labor is a key problem for suppliers who can't offer comparable salaries to the large planemakers.\n\nPatrice Arnoux, director of RecAero, said the manufacturer of parts and components had its own training program that takes just over a year to produce workers for the company and others in France's aerospace hub around Toulouse.\n\nMost of the 30 participants this year are unemployed.\n\n\"The needs are enormous,\" he said, adding RecAero was looking for 30 workers. \"If we are looking for 30 people, imagine Airbus and Safran.\"\n\nSome small and medium-sized suppliers in India see opportunities from the jet buying spree of their local airlines.\n\nAnkit Patel, founder and director of Ankit Fasteners with about 450 employees, was already looking to double capacity in the next three or four years.\n\n\"There is a euphoria around India,\" said Patel, whose company supplies fasteners like screws and bolts to Airbus and Boeing. \"Now's the time to capitalise, to say yes, we have capacity on the ground, Airbus and Boeing, look at us we can deliver.\"\n\n(Reporting by Allison Lampert in Paris and Aditi Shah in New Delhi; Editing by Mark Potter)", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysis-smaller-aerospace-suppliers-scramble-105557990.html", "symbols": ["AIR.F", "AIR.MC", "AIR.PA", "AIR.XETRA", "AIRA.F", "BA.MX", "BA.US", "BCO.F", "BCO.XETRA", "BOEI34.SA", "EADSF.US", "EADSY.US"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.986, "neg": 0.049, "neu": 0.867, "pos": 0.084}}, {"date": "2023-06-22T10:35:13+00:00", "title": "10 Least Competitive Industries in the World", "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the ten least competitive industries in the world. If you want to skip our analysis of why competition is important, head on over to 5 Least Competitive Industries in the World.\n\nCompetition sits at the heart of the business world and the capitalist system. It forces firms to innovate and makes those with unprofitable business models or obsolete products either get their act together or go out of business.\n\nIn fact, competition is also a large reason why the Western world was eventually able to overcome the Communist system of Soviet Russia. The country had a centralized planned economy, which required steel making plants to meet their monthly quotas. The managers of these plants as a result were not eager to improve their cost efficiencies and instead would simply overhire labor and order excess raw materials to just meet the requirements set by the government. Over the long term, this introduced inefficiencies in the system, and would often lead to managers sometimes not even meeting their production targets if they were afraid that the targets would be increased next year. The end result of this ensured a lack of competition in the Soviet Union's factories and stunted innovation - which have led to key technologies such as semiconductors and optics being relatively underdeveloped even today.\n\nThe world has changed since the time of the Soviet Union and one of the biggest changes comes in the form of the Internet. The internet allows people to make money while sitting at home instead of toiling away in factories or in offices. And its proliferation across the globe means that there are a variety of niche markets that any seller can target. And some great niche markets for 2023 come from none other than the retailing platform Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP). According to Shopify, great niche markets that can be interesting in 2023 include laptop accessories, desktop toys, reusable drinking straws, melatonin gummies, GPS pet trackers, and oil diffusers. And when it comes to finding high demand and low competition business ideas, it can pay to understand search algorithms to determine which products are in high demand, analyze competitor behavior, and see if any substitute products can attract similar demand to well selling ones.\n\nAdditionally, we don't need to take a look too far back in history to pick out which industries need competition. One of the biggest examples of an industry that lacked competition and was subsequently transformed due to an agile and intelligent entrant is aerospace. The aerospace industry has typically been funded by governments for state programs as its only other source of demand is satellites. And until 2015, the industry continued to rely on big and slow companies such as The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) and Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT). However, Space Exploration Technologies Corporation's (SpaceX) entry into the fray has forever changed the way in which the astronautics industry operates. SpaceX's reusable rocket has dramatically reduced the cost of launch, taken market share from the largest company before it, and broken the United Launch Alliance's (ULA) decades old monopoly in the national security space launch (NSSL) market.\n\nAnother industry that has been begging for competition for decades is satellite internet. For years the only options consumers have had came from satellites placed high up in geostationary orbits resulting in slow speeds due to the vast distances involved. And for decades, the low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite internet industry needed competition.\u00a0 Yet, only one firm made an attempt starting in the 1990s. And while Teledesic Corporation tried to break into the industry, eventually it had to go bankrupt. However, SpaceX is making its mark in the LEO internet market too, with its Starlink satellite service up and running and providing coverage globally. You can take a detailed look at the satellite industry by checking out 10 VLEO Technology Stocks and Startups to Watch.\n\nFurthermore, competition is not limited only to corporate players. It also extends itself to the job market, where thousands of candidates jostle to land a dream role. Yet, others also seek a relatively stress free life where they don't have to worry about competition in the job market. So what are some jobs that have low competition but pay remarkably well? Well, some roles are pediatricians, pharmacists, dentists, optometrists, and tax directors.\n\nFinally, one highly competitive industry that sees players cut prices aggressively to woo customers is telecommunications. On this front, the management of T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS) shared details about its strategies during the firm's latest earnings call where it shared:\n\nSo we announced last week our latest Un-carrier move with Phone Freedom, a move aimed to free customers and other wireless providers locked into those three-year contracts, while they are subjected to relentless pricing changes and gadgets. We continue to make it easier for customers to come to T-Mobile and switch to T-Mobile for peace of mind, knowing that with price lock, we won\u2019t raise their price for top text and data. And now with new one too are part of Phone Freedom, they will be upgrade-ready in two years, because three years is too long to force customers to wait.\n\nHere\u2019s kind of a crazy sort of fact to get your head around, AT&T reported the lowest postpaid phone churn in the industry this quarter and yet quantitative research states that their customers have the highest self-reported likelihood of switching away. Their customers report being almost 50% more likely to switch than Verizon\u2019s or T-Mobile\u2019s customers. The lowest churn, but the highest apparent dissatisfaction. And to me, that means one thing. Their customers are trapped and we are here to solve it and that\u2019s what our latest Un-carrier move is all about. That\u2019s what Phone Freedom is all about. And it\u2019s the way we have been designing our groundbreaking Un-carrier moves for a full decade now. And as you know, we hit another milestone this month, the three-year anniversary of our merger.\n\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at some of the least competitive industries in the world. If you're interested to find out about companies that have remained in business despite being mostly the same, you can check out 10 Least Innovative Companies That Are Still In Business Today. 10 Least Competitive Industries in the World\n\nNiloo / Shutterstock.com\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of the least competitive industries in the world, we used Michael Porter's Five Forces as the backbone of our hunt. According to Porter, industries with a high buyer and supplier power, high threats of substitution and new entrants, and high competitive rivalry have low returns on investments (ROIs) since companies have little pricing power to squeeze out more margins. So, we used data from CSI Market to see which industries have the lowest ROI as a proxy for the least competitive industries.\n\n10 Least Competitive Industries in the World\n\n10. Capital Goods\n\nReturn on Investment (ROI) Estimate: 9.55%\n\nThe capital goods industry is typically involved with making and selling heavy duty industrial equipment. This covers a wide range of products such as steam turbines, land excavators, tractors, jet engines, and other machines. The sector requires significant capital expenditure and guaranteed orders for companies to take the risk of producing bulky and expensive goods. Some notable capital goods companies are General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT), and Deere & Company (NYSE:DE).\n\n9. Consumer Non Cyclical\n\nReturn on Investment (ROI) Estimate: 8.49%\n\nThe consumer non cyclical industry takes its name from the idea of a business cycle. A business cycle, broadly speaking, describes the economy and the business environment as prospering in cycles of high and low growth. Consumer non cyclical companies are those that are relatively insulated against the changes in the business cycle as they are typically operating in stable sectors such as utilities, healthcare, and consumer staples - which are bound to see demand regardless of the state of the economy.\n\n8. Basic Materials\n\nReturn on Investment (ROI) Estimate: 8.01%\n\nThe basic materials industry is quite self explanatory really. It deals with the building blocks and raw materials for a variety of industries. One of the more popular basic materials segments these days is the lithium industry which is seeing sustained demand due to the global shift toward electric vehicles. Some well known basic materials companies are Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO), BHP Group (NYSE:BHP), and Vale SA (NYSE:VALE).\n\n7. Conglomerates\n\nReturn on Investment (ROI) Estimate: 7.04%\n\nConglomerates, simply put, are firms that try to do it all. These companies often have a global presence and often operate in completely unrelated industries. One of the best examples of a conglomerate is the South Korean chaebol Samsung which makes smartphones, medicines, washing machines, chips, and other products.\n\n6. Transportation\n\nReturn on Investment (ROI) Estimate: 5.56%\n\nThe transportation industry is one of the more crucial ones for economic progress. Not only does it enable firms to transport raw materials and finished goods across territories, but it is also the backbone of the tourism industry. Transportation spans across several mediums, including land, air, water, and more recently, space.\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Least Competitive Industries in the World.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nTop 20 Largest Consumer Staples Companies in the World 10 Least Digitized Industries That Are Ripe for Digital Transformation 10 Best Industrial Machinery Stocks to Buy\n\nDisclosure: None. 10 Least Competitive Industries in the World is originally published on Insider Monkey.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-least-competitive-industries-world-103513760.html", "symbols": ["BA.US", "BHP.US", "CAT.US", "DE.US", "GE.MX", "GE.US", "GEC.LSE", "GEOO34.SA", "GNE.PA", "LMT.US", "RIO.US", "SHOP.US", "TM5.F", "TMUS.US", "VALE.US"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.994, "neg": 0.052, "neu": 0.869, "pos": 0.079}}, {"date": "2023-06-22T09:24:43+00:00", "title": "Paris aviation deals signal recovery in face of supply challenges", "content": "A flurry of dealmaking at the Paris air show has confirmed that the aviation industry is back in business after the Covid pandemic \u2014 and that the world\u2019s two dominant plane makers still face a challenge navigating a supply chain that retains the scars of the crisis.

Luxair and Boeing today announced at the Paris Air Show 2023 that the Luxembourgish airline has selected the 737-7 as it continues its single-aisle growth strategy. (Image: Boeing)\n\nIn selecting the 737-7 Luxair will become the European launch customer for the airplane with an agreement to purchase four jets.\n\nSince March 2023, Luxair has placed orders for four 737-8. With today's announcement of the selection, the airline's commitment for four 737-7s will bring the airline's firm orders for the 737 to eight. Luxair will also initially lease two 737-8, due\u00a0 summer 2023, before taking direct delivery of its first 737-8.\n\n\"We continue to invest in Luxair's growth and this agreement for four Boeing 737-7 is an extra step towards securing a long term future for our national airline. This type of aircraft is a perfect match for Luxair and will meet the requirements of the market. Seating 160 passengers, the 737-7 will offer flexibility across the Luxair destination network while significantly reducing fuel consumption. This will help us get even closer to our commitment to sustainable flights, while demonstrating once again our support to the promise of \"Net-Zero carbon emissions by 2050\" submitted by IATA,\" said Gilles Feith, Luxair CEO.\n\nBoeing's ongoing commitment to sustainability is reflected in the 737-7/8s advanced design. On average, each 737 of this new generation will save up to eight million pounds of CO2 emissions annually compared to the airplanes it replaces. Additionally, these aircraft are quieter, creating a 50 percent smaller noise footprint than the airplanes they replace.\n\n\"We are delighted that Luxair has chosen to build upon its 737-8 order by selecting the 737-7 and in doing so becoming the launch customer in Europe for the airplane type,\" said Brad McMullen, senior vice president of Global Sales and Marketing, Boeing Commercial Airplanes. \"The 737-7 is perfectly suited across Luxair's network, seamlessly integrating in to its existing fleet and adding capacity on to regional routes. By selecting the 737-7 Luxair will operate a common fleet allowing it to move aircraft around the network based, increasing and dropping capacity based on seasonality and demand, ensuring maximum profitability flying all year round.\"\n\nLuxair currently operates a fleet of 19 airplanes, including eight Next-Generation 737s.\n\nAbout Luxair:\n\nFounded in 1961, Luxair is a key player in the economy of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and the surrounding Greater Region.

His answer is a lesson in leadership.\u00a0But one piece, in particular, resonated with me:\n\n\u201cYou have to be transparent with literally everything, no matter how uncomfortable the data is or the conversation is.\u00a0You have to tell everybody everything, including the media.\u00a0And you\u2019re going to get whacked along the way, and that\u2019s life. But for us to regain trust, number one with our own people, and then with the flying public, they were going to have to believe us. And that was the culture we were going to carry forward.\u201d\n\nThe general media critique was that Boeing had compromised safety for the sake of quarterly profits. But Calhoun sees it differently:\n\n\u201cWe had a culture problem.\u00a0But I\u2019ll characterize it quite a bit differently than the media liked to characterize it.\u00a0The idea that any human being makes a trade of quarterly profits over safety is just a flawed notion\u2026It\u2019s just not what happened.\u00a0What I do think I found was an organization and a company and a culture that was having a hard time being honest with one another, with where programs stood, how much time was required, what things still needed to be completed.\u00a0As a result, leadership became disconnected from the ground troops.\u201d\n\nI write a lot in this newsletter about how leadership has changed in recent decades.\u00a0But while many things have changed, some haven\u2019t. Calhoun says he learned the value of transparency from the iconic leader of the last century, former GE CEO Jack Welch.\n\n\u201cThe one thing you could count on from Jack was pure reality and pure clarity every step of the way.\u00a0He told you everything he thought about your business, what he had heard from the people he visited with in Crotonville the day before. He just went at you \u2026 He kept you ahead of the game.\u201d\n\nI pointed out there are other parts of the Welch management legacy that haven\u2019t weathered as well. His response:\n\n\u201cIt was a different time and a different context. Leaders have to change and adapt to the circumstances we\u2019re faced with. Do I think Jack would have adapted and led in these changed circumstances as well as he did back then?\u00a0I think the answer is yes.\u201d\n\nYou can listen to the full interview on Apple or Spotify.\u00a0More news below.\u00a0And be sure to read Shawn Tully\u2019s fascinating analysis of the \u201cTrillion Dollar Club\u201d and the challenge it poses to today\u2019s stock market investors.\n\nAlan Murray @alansmurray\r\nalan.murray@fortune.com\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nMore from Fortune: \r\n5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year\u2014all while working from home\r\nLooking to make extra cash?

KTOS recently formed an alliance with Shield AI to merge artificial intelligence (\u201cAI\u201d)-based piloting systems with former\u2019s unmanned aircraft XQ-58 Valkyrie. The alliance aims at promoting unmanned aircraft operations in the absence of GPS and communications.\n\nRationale Behind the Alliance\n\nThe integration of AI algorithms with unmanned vehicle will allow better management of complex task leading to overall operational efficiency and capability of unmanned vehicles. Also, the continuous monitoring of changing condition in a mission would provide more security for uncrewed jets.\n\nReal-time data analysis by the AI encourages trajectory optimization, reducing the operational cost of an unmanned vehicle. AI Pilots enabled jet to carry out tactical missions without GPS and communications interference, thus ensuing optimal safety of jets.\n\nWith that being said, the integration of Kratos\u2019s Valkyrie XQ-58 with AI pilot would bring about a revolution in the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) segment of the defense landscape and would certainly meet the needs of changing dynamics of warfare capabilities. This would result in the steady flow of contracts for Kratos, thus boosting its revenue-generation prospects from the unmanned vehicle businesses.\n\nGrowth Prospects\n\nOngoing technology advancement needs in carrying out combat missions is fueling a rapid increase in defense spending by nations across the globe. In such a scenario, increased spending on autonomous capabilities like UAV has been witnessed and will likely gain more traction in the days ahead.\n\nPer the report from Markets and Markets, the UAV market is poised to witness a CAGR of 7.9% over 2022-2027 period. This reflects on expanding market opportunities for companies like KTOS that enjoy an established position in the UAV manufacturing.\n\nIn this context, it is imperative to mention that Kratos manufactures nearly 150 jet drones annually, thus entailing significant demand and order line up from United States Air Force, Navy, Army, Marine Corps and others. The pairing of AI pilot with its Valkyrie would unlock strategic benefits for KTOS by staying at the forefront of innovation. Other defense majors that may benefit from the increasing demand for UAV\u2019s are:\n\nNorthrop Grumman NOC: It is a leader in autonomous systems and offers an impressive portfolio of UAVs. Some products include Global Hawk, MQ-4C Triton, Future Autonomous Air, etc\n\nNorthrop has a long-term earnings growth rate of 3.8%.

(Photo: Shutterstock/Soos Jozcef)\n\nBoeing and Airbus have used the Paris Air Show this week to highlight customer orders for new aircraft, but there is little activity on the freighter front so far. On Tuesday, Boeing announced the first cargo-related deal with African carrier Air Alg\u00e9rie, although it involves aftermarket conversion of passenger aircraft and not production of new aircraft.\n\nThe flag carrier of Algeria placed a firm order with Boeing (NYSE: BA) for eight 737-9 MAX passenger jets and tentatively agreed to place two used 737-800 passenger jets in the freighter conversion program.\n\nThe converted freighters essentially represent the start of a dedicated cargo unit for Air Alg\u00e9rie, which operates 55 passenger aircraft and one Hercules L100-30 \u2014 the civilian variant of the Lockheed C-130 military transport, according to the company\u2019s website.\n\nThe 737-800 is a standard-size aircraft and can carry more than 26 tons of payload once reconfigured for carrying containers on the main deck. Air Alg\u00e9rie\u2019s passenger fleet includes 25 737-800s.\n\nThe dearth of orders for freighters at the Paris Air Show indicates that the 16-month downturn in air cargo demand is causing leasing companies and cargo airlines to slow down capital expenditures for new aircraft. During the prior three years there was an explosion in orders for converted freighters.\n\nBoeing on Tuesday also struck deals with China Airlines for eight 787-9 Dreamliners and with lessor Avolon for 40 737-8 MAX aircraft.\n\nAir Tanzania 767 freighter\n\nAfrica\u2019s prospects for economic growth is driving regional carriers to beef up their freighter capacity. Air Tanzania this month took delivery of its first 767-300 production freighter from Boeing, marking the manufacturer\u2019s first sale of a new-build freighter to an African carrier.\n\nThe medium-size widebody freighter, which provides Air Tanzania more cargo flexibility beyond its passenger fleet, is expected to carry imports and exports of perishable goods, pharmaceuticals and e-commerce products that require timely delivery.\n\nAir Tanzania currently operates commercial service across Africa and to destinations in Asia with a fleet that includes two 787-8 Dreamliners. The airline also has orders for an additional 787-8 and two 737 MAX jets.\n\nIn May, Boeing delivered three 777 Freighters: one each to China Airlines, China Southern Airlines and DHL Aviation. UPS received two 767-300 freighters and FedEx Express added one.\n\nAirbus takes early Paris lead\n\nAirbus has dominated the Paris show so far, led by a blockbuster order from India\u2019s IndiGo for 500 A320 aircraft. Flynas, a low-cost Saudi Arabian airline, finalized an order for 30 A320 neos; Air Mauritius and Philippine Airlines made purchase commitments for three and nine A350 long-haul jets; and Qantas finalized an incremental order for nine A220 regional jets.\n\nAir India also finalized previously announced orders for 250 Airbus jets and 290 Boeing single-aisle and widebody aircraft.\n\nClick here for more FreightWaves stories by Eric Kulisch.\n\nRECOMMENDED READING:\n\nAir cargo\u2019s busy season looking more like mole hill than mountain peak\n\nThe post Cargo aircraft missing from Paris Air Show dealmaking appeared first on FreightWaves.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cargo-aircraft-missing-paris-air-144849983.html", "symbols": ["AIR.F", "AIR.MC", "AIR.PA", "AIR.XETRA", "AIRA.F", "BA.MX", "BA.US", "BCO.F", "BCO.XETRA", "BOEI34.SA", "EADSF.US", "EADSY.US"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.967, "neg": 0.022, "neu": 0.918, "pos": 0.06}}, {"date": "2023-06-20T14:32:51+00:00", "title": "Dow Jones Falls 375 Points After Key Housing Data; Alibaba Slides As CEO Steps Down", "content": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped Tuesday after key housing data.

This reflects a solid 11.1% improvement from the prior long-term outlook made by America\u2019s largest jet maker in 2021.\n\nHighlights of the Outlook\n\nBoeing projects global demand for new commercial planes to reach 42,595 by 2042, indicating an improvement of 3.9% from 2022\u2019s figure. Overall, the global fleet is projected to double to more than 48,500 in the next 20 years. In particular, new single-aisle airplanes will account for more than 75% of all new deliveries, totaling more than 32,000 airplanes, reflecting an increase of 3.2% from the 2022 outlook.\r\n\r\nMarket opportunities for commercial services are now projected to be worth $3.8 trillion over the next 20 years, which implies a solid 5.6% hike over the prior 20-year forecast.\n\nWhat Led to the Increased View?\n\nOvercoming the woes of pandemic, commercial air travel has been improving in the recent past, buoyed by increased economic activities. Moreover, the growth of low-cost carriers (LCC) has been driving down fares, thereby making travel more accessible.\n\nThis in turn has been bolstering the commercial aerospace along with the aftermarket aviation services market, which played the role of the key growth catalyst, boosting Boeing\u2019s jet market outlook.\n\nNotably, global air traffic in February 2023 (measured in revenue passenger kilometers or RPKs) rose 55.5% compared with February 2022. Globally, traffic is now at 84.9% of the February 2019 levels. Looking ahead, passenger traffic is projected to return to 2019 levels over the course of the next 12-18 months. Such favorable projections must have encouraged Boeing to upgrade its 20-year commercial market outlook.\n\nStocks to Gain\n\nConsidering the aforementioned discussion, we may safely conclude that with the release of Boeing\u2019s latest outlook, the spotlight is primarily on major commercial jet maker stocks. These include Boeing and Airbus, which constitute more than 50% of the global commercial jet market, along with a few more, which hold solid growth prospects and hence should find a place on investors\u2019 watchlist.\n\nBoeing develops, produces, and markets commercial jets, along with providing related support services. The company is a leading producer of commercial aircraft and has a series of commercial jetliners like the 737 Next-Generation narrow-body model as well as the 747, 767, 777 and 787 wide-body models.\r\n\r\nThis Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock boasts a long-term earnings growth estimate of 4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BA\u2019s 2024 sales implies an improvement of 15.8% from the 2023 expected sales figure.\n\nAirbus\u2019 EADSY diverse product line includes renowned passenger jetliners, which vary in size from 100-seat jetliners to the double-deck A380 that is capable of transporting more than 850 passengers. Its significant jetliners are A220, A320, A330, A350 and A380.\r\n\r\nThis Zacks Rank #3 stock has a long-term earnings growth estimate of 12.4%. The consensus estimate for EADSY\u2019s 2024 sales suggests an improvement of 14.4% from the 2023 expected sales figure. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nTextron TXT is a renowned aircraft manufacturer of a variety of jets including business jets. Its Textron Aviation segment is home to the Beechcraft, Cessna and Hawker aircraft brands.\r\n\r\nThis Zacks Rank #3 stock company\u2019s earnings are projected to grow 7.4% in the long term.

Wall Street is expected to return from the long weekend in a cautious mood.\n\n1. China cuts interest rates\n\nThe People\u2019s Bank of China cut its key lending benchmarks on Tuesday, in the latest sign that the country\u2019s authorities are concerned that the post-pandemic recovery in the world's second-largest economy is losing momentum.\n\nThe one-year loan prime rate was lowered by 10 basis points to 3.55%, while the five-year LPR was cut by the same margin to 4.20% - the first such reductions in 10 months.\n\nThe PBOC had also lowered short- and medium-term policy rates last week.\n\nHowever, these moves received a lukewarm reception as concerns about the country\u2019s property market had meant that some within the market had expected more.\n\nChina's cabinet met on Friday to discuss measures to spur growth in the economy, and while nothing fresh emerged from these discussions, wider stimulus measures are widely expected in the fullness of time.\n\nThe weakening Chinese economy could also be behind the apparent thawing in relations between Beijing and Washington - the last thing needed at this point would be a trade war with a major export market!\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken met with President Xi Jinping on Monday, with the Chinese leader calling the progress \u201cvery good\u201d.\n\nAlthough little in concrete was agreed upon, the two sides are still talking, with Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang now likely to visit Washington in the next few months.\n\n2. Alibaba CEO to head up cloud unit\n\nThe importance of Alibaba\u2019s cloud unit was laid bare Tuesday, with the Chinese e-commerce giant announcing earlier Tuesday that current chairman and CEO Daniel Zhang will step down after eight years to front up the key unit.\n\n\u201cThis is the right time for me to make a transition, given the importance of Alibaba Cloud Intelligence Group as it progresses towards a full spin-off,\u201d Zhang said in a statement issued by Alibaba (NYSE:BABA).\n\nAlibaba announced in March that the company would be restructured into six business groups, looking to spin off and potentially list them in the coming year.\n\nEddie Yongming Wu, chairman of the Taobao and Tmall Group will take over from Zhang as CEO, while Joseph Tsai, who is currently executive vice chair, will replace Zhang as chairman.\n\n3. Futures lower; Fed speakers prompt caution\n\nU.S. futures traded lower Tuesday, as investors return to a holiday-shortened week and cautiously await more clues of the Federal Reserve\u2019s future monetary policy.\n\nAt 04:50 ET (08:50 GMT), the Dow futures contract had dropped 130 points or 0.4%, S&P 500 futures fell 19 points or 0.4%, and Nasdaq 100 futures dropped 85 points or 0.6%.\n\nThe main equity averages posted strong gains last week after the Fed paused its prolonged rate-hiking cycle, with the broad-based S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite recording their best weekly performances since March, rising 2.6% and 3.3%, respectively.\n\nHowever, investors appear to be reluctant to chase these gains higher, with the likes of Federal Reserve St. Louis President James Bullard, New York Fed President John Williams, and Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr all set to speak later in the session.\n\nAdditionally, Fed chair Jerome Powell starts his two-day congressional testimony on Wednesday.\n\nThese officials could potentially hint at a July hike given the Fed signaled the possibility of more rate increases later in the year if inflation remained an issue.\n\nIn corporate news, shipping giant FedEx (NYSE:FDX) reports its quarterly results after the closing bell.\n\n4. Tide turning for aircraft manufacturers\n\nHard hit during the pandemic, aircraft manufacturers are starting to show signs of having turned the corner, with demand seemingly on the rise.\n\nAirbus (EPA:AIR) secured a historic deal on Monday, announcing an order for 500 narrowbody jets from Indian budget carrier IndiGo - the most jets ever bought by a single airline.\n\nThe deal beats Air India's combined purchase of 470 jets earlier this year as India's two largest carriers plan for a sharp expansion in regional travel demand.\n\nThis follows rival Boeing (NYSE:BA) stating over the weekend that it expects to increase production of its best-selling 737 MAX to 38 jets a month \"pretty soon,\" as the U.S. company looks to take advantage of demand ramping up.\n\nThat said, there are still likely to be problems ahead, with the head of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, Stan Deal, noting that the company is still likely to see supply chain instability, while Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury said that supply disruption remained a short-term issue.\n\n5. Oil mixed; demand concerns remain despite China cut\n\nCrude prices traded in a mixed fashion Tuesday, as U.S. traders returned from the long weekend to digest the Chinese rate cut.\n\nBy 04:50 ET, U.S. crude futures were 0.2% lower at $71.78 a barrel than Friday\u2019s close, while the Brent contract rose 0.6% to $76.58 per barrel. There was no settlement in the WTI contract on Monday due to a public holiday in the United States.\n\nGrowing concerns over an economic recovery in China, the world\u2019s largest crude importer, have weighed on oil prices of late, and the latest cut in the country\u2019s benchmark loan prime rate [see above] only had a limited impact given it was largely anticipated by markets.\n\nTraders are also nervous ahead of Fed chair Jerome Powell\u2019s two-day congressional testimony, starting Wednesday, given the central bank hinted at more interest rate hikes ahead even as it paused its year-long tightening cycle last week.\n\nThe prospect of rising U.S. rates and the associated impact on economic activity in the world\u2019s largest energy consumer have weighed heavily on crude this year.\n\nU.S. crude inventories jumped almost 8 million barrels last week, way above forecast, while fuel stocks exceeded expectations as well, raising questions about energy demand during the peak summer travel period.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nChina rate cut, Alibaba shuffle, aircraft manufacturers - what's moving markets\n\nHSBC cuts China's GDP forecast to 5.3% on weak property, business outlook\n\nForeigners biggest buyers of Asian bonds in two years", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-rate-cut-alibaba-shuffle-050853641.html", "symbols": ["BA.MX", "BA.US", "BABA.US", "BCO.F", "BCO.XETRA", "BOEI34.SA", "FDX.US", "GSPC.INDX", "IXIC.INDX"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": -0.076, "neg": 0.072, "neu": 0.862, "pos": 0.066}}]
