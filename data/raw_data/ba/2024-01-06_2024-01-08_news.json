The fact that United has now found some aircraft with loose bolts, that just means that the investigation is going to be expanded.\n\n\u201cIt just illustrates how important it was to ground similar MAX 9s and do those inspections. A lot of times in the industry money and profit are placed before safety. And grounding a specific aircraft isn\u2019t a light decision.

But getting to the root cause here, do we anticipate, based on your experience in the industry, is this a management issue or is this about some of the talent turnover that we've seen coming out of the pandemic with just a dearth of talent in this industry. Which of those two do you think is, the more likely cause of what happened here.\n\nGEORGE FERGUSON: So I'm going to say that I would think that every talent issue would still be a management issue, right? So it is a turnover issue. There's been a lot of turnover at Spirit, and a lot of turnover at Boeing. But management's job is to bring in those replacement workers, train them well, train them on the processes so they don't miss anything, train them on safety, and then oversee them on the line.\n\nAnd if it's something that happened on the line and was overlooked, I'm going to say that's management's fault. Management needs to do a better job in that situation. So and I do think that's probably what happened here is that there's been a lot of turnover in these industries. Pre-pandemic, this airplane was grounded. So if you're at Spirit AeroSystems you're probably wondering what your long-term prospects were, as your most important airplane, the Max, wasn't even allowed to fly globally.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs that was getting fixed, we got into the pandemic, global airline traffic went to almost zero. So I think if you're at Boeing or Spirit, you might have been looking for another job, they've had a lot of turnover, management's job to come in now to train people to do it right the first time.\n\n- And George, I'm also interested, listen, United Alaska they're going to be the most impacted by this Max 9 grounding. I'm interested George, can we try and quantify how much they're being impacted financially in terms of just lost profit?\n\nGEORGE FERGUSON: Sure. So I plugged some numbers in yesterday. I used Alaska because United's a mixed fleet, right? United has narrow bodies and widebodies. So I took Alaska. First, we look at 1Q last year for Alaska, they didn't make any money. So I think they're not going to want to use that when they talk to Boeing about remuneration. If you look at 3Q, we did some numbers. If Boeing were to reimburse them for profits per airplane, based on their profitability in 3Q as well as reimburse for salaries, because salaries don't go away just because an airplane's grounded.\n\nWe think that the total fleet 225 airplanes, there's probably $5 million ish per day in remuneration that needs to come out of probably Boeing, if it's their fault, to reimburse the airlines. The question will be how long, how many airplanes will be on the ground for how long. When you do the math in that to figure out what the cost is. But five million per day because of the [INAUDIBLE].", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/video/boeing-could-payout-5m-per-214015844.html", "symbols": ["ALK.F", "ALK.US", "BA.MX", "BA.US", "BCO.F", "BCO.XETRA", "BOEI34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.989, "neg": 0.02, "neu": 0.896, "pos": 0.084}}, {"date": "2024-01-08T21:34:22+00:00", "title": "Boeing Stock, Spirit Return To Lows After Loose Bolts Reported On 737 Max 9s", "content": "Boeing stock, supplier Spirit AeroSystems tumbled early Monday after the FAA grounded all Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft.

It's after the FAA grounded more than 170 Boeing 737 MAX 9 aircraft after a door detached mid-air on an Alaska Airlines flight. With more on markets movements happening around that decision is Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre. Jared.\n\nJARED BLIKRE: Thank you, Josh. Let's take a look at our aerospace board. Not a lot of red, except for Boeing. And I'll show you another exception there. Down 6 and 1/2%. This is going to be the worst day for Boeing since late 2022. And as you can see, we've been in several different trading ranges here.\n\nBut let me just show you historically how the stock has reacted to a couple of different events. And the first would be the Lion Air Flight 610 in late 2018 and then Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 in early 2019.\n\nAnd what I've done is I've taken the stock action. I've shown one month before the event or 21 trading days along with 63 or one quarter's worth of trading days afterwards. And you can see in purple, that was the first incident.\n\nWe got a pretty steep decline, about 5%, 6%, 7% on the first day. Then the stock recovered pretty quickly. We did see some further fallout. But by the time the quarter had ended, the trailing quarter, we were kind of right back where we had started.\n\nNow the Ethiopian Airlines, that second disaster, that's when we saw more fallout. There were two 5 plus down days in a row there at the very beginning. As you saw before, we're down about 6% today just by comparison.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd then you can see the stock really just drifted lower and had a tough time finding its footing. And eventually, it would drop pretty considerably. And let me just show you a five-year chart of Boeing going back to the beginning of this disaster.\n\nSo here is Boeing. Here is a five-year chart. And we had all of this price. Actually, let me put a 10-year chart. We had all of this price action up in here. Once this level went, it was a very quick drop, plus we had the pandemic. That compounded everything.\n\nBut you can see we are still in the bottom end of this very long trading range here. So if we were to jump above, we would have probably smooth sailing into the 300. But there's a considerable overhead resistance.\n\nAlso want to point out that one of the biggest suppliers here, one of the companies most dependent on Boeing for its revenue, that Spirit Aerosystem, seeing a 6% drop today. It's a more volatile stock. And if this chart looks somewhat similar to Boeing, that's because it is.\n\nThis was the same time period in which Boeing was trying to figure out its footing with respect to its highs. And then this drop was the same drop that we saw in Boeing. So two very different stocks reacting the same way to a tragic event here but not quite as bad as the earlier tragedies which involved the human life loss, of course.\n\n- Well, Jared, this is the latest, like you said, in a series of mechanical failures for Boeing, two fatal crashes, one in Indonesia in 2018, the other in Ethiopia in 2019, like you said, both involving those Boeing 737s. What were the stock moves then? And how does that compare to what we're seeing today?\n\nJARED BLIKRE: Well, I think they were quite a bit more dramatic. The first time this happened, this would be Lion Air Flight 610. We saw about a 5% drop on day one. But then by the second time we had Ethiopian Airlines flight, we not only got that first day drop, we got a big second day drop as well. And the difference between those two time periods, I think, was just the realization that something bigger was at play here.\n\nWhen there was only one failure, you can see the stock recovered pretty quickly those losses. This was only a few trading days later, whereas with the second disaster, we saw it meandering down here and kind of lingering at the lows for some time. And then it just drifted lower with the sequence of bad news that was coming out.\n\nSo hard to say where we're falling in line this time. It's hard to see here. But this yellow line is pretty-- this yellow line here is pretty comparable to the first day drops that we saw for these earlier two. So so far it looks kind of the same. But I can't stress enough that these are very, very different scenarios.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/video/boeing-737-max-incident-groundings-210918421.html", "symbols": ["BA.MX", "BA.US", "BCO.F", "BCO.XETRA", "BOEI34.SA", "S9Q.F", "SPR.US"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": -0.975, "neg": 0.079, "neu": 0.867, "pos": 0.054}}, {"date": "2024-01-08T19:39:00+00:00", "title": "Boeing and Key Supplier Spirit Hit Hard After Alaska Air Blowout", "content": "Thankfully, no passengers or crew of Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 were critically injured after the frightening blowout of a plug door and piece of fuselage from the 737-9 MAX jet Friday night, which forced the plane to make an emergency landing in Portland, Oregon. Investors in Alaska Air Group (NYSE:ALK) didn\u2019t seem too concerned about the incident either. Shares of Alaska Air were flat in midday trading. But it was another story for Boeing (NYSE:BA) and one of its key suppliers.\n\nBoeing, which makes the 737-9 MAX, tumbled nearly 7%. And Spirit AeroSystems Holdings (NYSE:SPR), the manufacturer of the fuselage that was on the Alaska Airlines plane, plunged over 6%. It\u2019s understandable that traders would be nervous, especially since the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) quickly announced the grounding of more than 170 Boeing 737-9 MAX planes pending safety inspections.\n\nSpirit AeroSystems said in a statement that it will work with Boeing on the investigation of Friday\u2019s incident and that it is \u201cfollowing the protocols set by the regulatory authorities.\u201d For its part, Boeing said that \u201cwe agree with and fully support the FAA\u2019s decision to require immediate inspections of 737-9 airplanes with the same configuration as the affected airplane.\u201d In addition, a Boeing technical team is supporting the National Transportation Safety Board\u2019s (NTSB) investigation of the matter. And Alaska Air has said it is ready to perform the required inspections of the 737-9 MAX planes in its fleet while the jets remain grounded.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nInvestors Should Ignore SPR, BA Stocks\n\nSo, what does Friday\u2019s incident mean for investors? Even though several analysts were quick to come out with reports defending Boeing Monday morning, the Alaska Air scare is probably another reason for traders to ignore Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems for the foreseeable future.\n\nWhile airline stocks have started to recover thanks to strong demand for travel as consumers and business people return to the skies, Boeing continues to suffer from a hit to its reputation and concerns about safety following two fatal crashes (one in late 2018 and another in early 2019) of 737 MAX jets that led to the deaths of 346 people.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe 737 MAX was temporarily grounded after those tragedies and Boeing has lost more than $20 billion in the past five years as the company has been forced to delay deliveries of planes while spending heavily to make necessary fixes. (Mounting costs to build new Air Force One planes for the government hasn\u2019t helped either). The production slowdown for Boeing was a big problem for Spirit AeroSystems as well, which has also posted several years of losses because of both the pandemic and Boeing\u2019s delivery woes. Spirit even disclosed in late October that Boeing was spending $100 million to help stabilize Spirit\u2019s supply chain and support production increases.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nBut that development seems like a distant memory now. With safety worries once again surfacing for Boeing and Spirit, both companies are likely to continue to struggle financially. Although Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems are each currently expected to return to profitability in 2024, that\u2019s no longer a certain bet given the new groundings enforced by the FAA. Analysts have already been slashing their profit forecasts for this year for both companies over the past few months due to macroeconomic concerns. That trend is likely to continue given the Alaska Air incident.\n\nShares of both Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems have tanked for the past five years, missing out on the market\u2019s post-pandemic rebound to near record highs. Boeing has plummeted 35% since January 2019 while Spirit AeroSystems has shed nearly two-thirds of its market value. The Dow Jones, on the other hand, is up more than 50% during the same time frame and the S&P 500 has soared 80%. And with 737-MAX 9 planes remaining on the tarmac for the foreseeable future, it\u2019s hard to imagine a scenario where Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems can gain altitude anytime soon.\n\nAs of this writing, Paul R.

These companies are pioneering us toward the stars but are also great businesses in their own right. Collectively, space stocks are helping us extend travel beyond the Earth\u2019s atmosphere and are great growth drivers for delivering gains to investors.\n\nIn this article, I\u2019ve put together a list of space stocks I believe are the best buys at today\u2019s prices. These companies should be on every investor\u2019s watch list due to their disruptive potential.\n\nSo, here are the best space stocks to consider.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nVirgin Galactic (SPCE) A photo of a man smiling into a camera on a plane.\n\nVirgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE) is a spaceflight company within the Virgin Group, aiming to provide suborbital spaceflights to space tourists.\n\nNow might be a great time for investors to invest in SPCE stock. The reason is that its Galactic 06 space mission is due to launch near the end of this month. The mission will carry four astronauts, and I expect it will ramp up interest in spaceflight globally.\n\nMeanwhile, from a fundamental perspective, SPCE may also be undervalued. Analysts collectively predict its share has an implied 26.6% upside from its present levels.\n\nSince space flight is still in its very early stages, SPCE has yet to become cash flow positive, as it recorded a negative cash flow of $514.25 million for the last 12 months. But as missions like Galactic 06 ramp up in frequency and duration, I expect more investors will take notice of the collective potential of space stocks, which will be accretive for Virgin Galactic.\n\nBoeing (BA) BA stock: a blue and white Boeing 787 flying in the sky above the clouds\n\nSource: vaalaa / Shutterstock\n\nBoeing (NYSE:BA), to me, can be considered a kind of picks and shovels supplier to the space industry. It\u2019s a key contractor for NASA and is also working on its own spacecraft, the Starliner.\n\nThe Starliner test flight is expected to be made in April, while its first operational flight could be as early as 2025. The main use of the spacecraft will be to transport astronauts to the International Space Station \u2014 a key divergence from shuttles.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo me, BA stock is a great buy in general while also keeping its growth as one of those space stocks in one\u2019s back pocket. Namely, Wall Street rates Boeing as a Strong Buy. That recommendation also comes with a modest price target increase of around 4% over the next 12 months.\n\nAlthough BA stock\u2019s P/E ratio is currently negative, its forward price-to-sales ratio is lower than its trailing 12-month price-to-sales ratio. That means its share could be trading hands at a discount to what analysts expect as fair value.\n\nNorthrop Grumman (NOC) Northrop Grumman (NOC) logo on a corporate building\n\nSource: Kristi Blokhin / Shutterstock.com\n\nNorthrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) is deeply involved in space technology and exploration. Its core areas of expertise are in satellite technology and robotics, and the company previously worked with NASA during various missions.\n\nNOC is primarily a defense stock, but its engagements in space have also recently included collaborations with the Air Force Research Laboratory to integrate commercial space internet into airborne platforms.\n\nTo put this project into simple turns, it plans on reconfiguring existing satellite constellations to allow them to be used for military purposes, such as in warfighters.\n\nNOC is a solid defense pick based on its quarterly results. Its third-quarter earnings rose about 5% to $6.18 per share, with a 9% revenue growth reaching $9.78 billion. That performance exceeded analyst expectations.\n\nThe company also increased its full-year sales forecast to $39 billion, up from the earlier range of $38.4 billion to $38.8 billion.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Her estimate is based on the widely-held expectation that the Federal Aviation Administration will clarify what airlines need to inspect on 737-9s by the middle of the week, which would allow planes to begin returning to service.\n\nAlaska cancelled roughly 160 flights on Saturday and 170 flights on Sunday as a result of the suspension. United cancelled 90 flights on Saturday and 180 on Sunday. Both airlines expect cancellations to continue through the middle of the week.\n\nAlaska and United are the largest operators of the 737-9 with 65 and 79 aircraft, respectively. Other global operators include Aeromexico, Copa Airlines, FlyDubai, and Icelandair.\n\nThe FAA grounded most 737-9s on Saturday pending inspections of what is known as a \u201cmid-cabin door plug.\u201d Planes that do not have a door plug, including those at FlyDubai and Icelandair, are unaffected.\n\nBoeing on Monday provided airlines with critical information on how to inspect the planes to return them to service, Reuters reported.\n\nThe temporary grounding followed the sudden decompression and loss of the plug on an Alaska 737-9 operating flight AS1282 from Portland, Oregon, to Ontario, California, on Friday. The aircraft returned to Portland where all 171 passengers and six crew members deplaned. The plane involved in the accident, registration N704AL, was delivered new to Alaska on October 31.\n\nBoeing Fallout\n\nThe accident is the latest blow the beleaguered 737 Max. The plane was grounded for nearly two years until November 2020 following two fatal crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia. Boeing has since racked up hundredsof ordersfor the Max, which is the only significant competitor to Airbus\u2019 popular A320neo family of aircraft.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cWe do see the latest incident as eroding the fragile confidence that has been built around the 737 Max franchise,\u201d wrote Bank of America analyst Ronald Epstein on Monday. \u201cThat said, at this point in time, due to the duopoly nature of the industry, we do not see\u00a0this impacting orders\u00a0for any of the 737 Max variants.\u201d\n\nThe 737-9 is the least popular Max variant with just 76 outstanding orders plus 215 planes already delivered to airlines, according to Cirium Fleets Analyzer. The 737-8 is the most popular with 1,176 aircraft in service and at least another 1,971 on order. The yet-to-be-certified 737-7 has at least 333 orders and the -10 903 orders. Boeing has another 1,236 Max orders where the variant has yet to be determined.\n\nEpstein added that, at this early stage in the NTSB\u2019s investigation, the cause \u201cappears to be a manufacturing quality escape as opposed to a design issue. Door plugs are commonly used on commercial airframes.\u201d\n\nBoeing supplier Spirit AeroSystems manufactures the fuselage section and door plug in question on the 737-9.\n\nBoeing shares opened down more than 8% at $228 on Monday, the first trading day since the accident.\n\nJanuary Benefit to Airlines\n\nA silver lining for Alaska, United, and the other airlines affected by the FAA\u2019s grounding of most 737-9s is that it is January. The month is among the slowest of the year for travel demand in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nHelane Becker, an analyst at TD Cowen, noted on Monday that airlines also benefit from an extra day in February owing to Leap Year, and the shift of the Easter holiday into March from April. Both are boosts to airlines\u2019 first-quarter financial results.\n\nBecker expects airlines to have an estimate on the cost of the grounding by the time they report fourth-quarter results later in January.\n\nSpokespeople for Aeromexico, Alaska, and United both declined to comment on the cost of the 737-9 grounding.\n\nGet breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alaska-united-may-see-little-163701990.html", "symbols": ["ALK.F", "ALK.US", "BA.MX", "BA.US", "BCO.F", "BCO.XETRA", "BOEI34.SA", "UAL.MX", "UAL.US", "UAL1.F"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.961, "neg": 0.044, "neu": 0.881, "pos": 0.075}}, {"date": "2024-01-08T16:35:58+00:00", "title": "Boeing Stock Sells Off After Blowout, 737 MAX 9 Groundings", "content": "Shares of Boeing and supplier Spirit AeroSystems fell Monday following a midair incident that left a gaping hole in a jet operated by Alaska Airlines.

The checks are expected to take 4-8 hours each, suggesting the airlines will be able to quickly restore services after grounding hundreds of flights.\n\nThe mishap occurred when a door-shaped panel ripped out as Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 climbed out of Portland, Oregon. The aircraft reached an altitude of about 16,000 feet before turning around and landing back in Portland about 20 minutes after takeoff.

We\u2019ll also see a slow trickle of quarterly earnings reports this week until the spigot opens Friday morning with Q4 results from some of the biggest Wall Street banks: JPMorgan JPM, Citigroup C, Bank of America BAC and Wells Fargo WFC.\r\n\r\nMarkets have moderated notably since the beginning of the year, but they\u2019re no longer taking a nosedive. As of last Thursday, we\u2019ve begun to see a flattening, which would suggest market participants were interested in taking a bit of air out of the valuation balloon overall; economic data is materializing of late that suggests a March interest rate cut from the Fed may be getting a bit ahead of ourselves; pricing in six or seven cuts throughout the year are being re-thunk, as well.\r\n\r\nThat said, December core CPI year over year is expected to come in sub-4% for the first time since early 2021, and well off the 6 1/2% core CPI year-over-year rates we were seeing as recently as the second half of 2022. This is one inflation metric where we do see clear results of high interest rates dissolving rampant inflation over time, and any downward surprises may put those projections for near-term cuts back on the table. However, non-core CPI numbers are expected to tick up.\r\n\r\nPPI results are projected to post the first positive results since September, coming off a 0.0% print for November. These numbers have been trending within a range of -0.4% to +0.7% since mid-2022. But just like with non-core CPI, PPI moving slightly higher is something worth keeping an eye on, including the rate of change month over month.\r\n\r\nBesides the Big Banks on Friday, we expect quarterly results for KB Home KBH on Wednesday and Delta Air Lines DAL on Friday. This morning, Boeing (BA) is taking the Dow more than -130 points lower following two incidents where pressurization in its cabin blew out an Alaskan Air ALK window and a Spirit Airline SAVE door in Boeing\u2019s 737 MAX-9 planes. Recall the 737 MAX control panel difficulties which led to a year-plus grounding and no sales following two plane crashes overseas. This does not appear to be a re-emergence of prior issues, but another black eye for the model of which Boeing was looking to sell many units.\r\n\r\nThe S&P 500, meanwhile, is flat ahead of the opening bell. The Nasdaq is +25 points at this hour. Boeing shares are -7.7% currently.\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Boeing slumped in premarket US trading as investors assess the effect on production and any long-term harm to the planemaker\u2019s outlook and reputation.\n\nWhile no one was seriously injured, National Transportation Safety Board Chair Jennifer Homendy said only luck prevented a more disastrous outcome. The US Federal Aviation Administration has temporarily grounded the Max 9 for safety checks, affecting 171 aircraft around the world, most of which are in the US, where Alaska and United Airlines Holdings Inc. are the biggest operators.\n\nThe recovery of the door plug is an important breakthrough in the investigation, though the NTSB hasn\u2019t been able to secure some other key evidence. The jet\u2019s cockpit voice recorder, which has a two-hour recording time, was overridden and that data has been lost. Investigators will also look into the airline\u2019s handling of several pressure warnings on previous flights, Homendy said.\n\nShares of Boeing fell 7.9% in premarket US trading, while supplier Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc., which makes the fuselage for the 737, slid 16%.\n\nRead More: Boeing CEO\u2019s Comeback Plan for 2024 Takes a Hit Five Days In\n\nThe door plug on the aircraft, which had just entered service on Nov. 11, was found in the backyard of a Portland-based school teacher, Homendy said. Other areas of focus for the NTSB at Sunday night\u2019s briefing were around the oxygen masks that were deployed and the state of the plane after the incident.\n\nStory continues\n\nFlight 1282\u2019s auto pressurization fail light had lit up on three previous flights, most recently on Jan. 4, Homendy said. In those instances, crew had flipped the switch to \u201calt mode,\u201d which is acceptable considering there\u2019s a backup.\n\nThe NTSB chair said there was a decision by Alaska Airlines, after the light had come on, to put in place a restriction that prevents a plane from flying long distances, or in Alaska Airlines\u2019 case, being flown to Hawaii over water. A maintenance check was ordered by the airline but hadn\u2019t been carried out, she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure I will be asked if there is any correlation between the light that illuminated and the expulsion of the door plug,\u201d Homendy said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know that there was any correlation.\u201d\n\nRegulators reacted swiftly to Friday\u2019s incident, grounding 171 of the variant less than 24 hours after the incident, including the entire fleet of 737 Max 9s in the US. Airlines like Alaska Air, United and Aeromexico were among carriers that grounded all aircraft subsequently.\n\nHomendy said the circuit breaker for the plane\u2019s cockpit voice recorder wasn\u2019t pulled because while the maintenance team went out to get it, it was \u201cright at about the two hour mark and it was completely overwritten at two hours.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe NTSB has many times talked about the need to increase the time on CVRs from two hours to 25 hours, which is consistent with Europe and many other countries,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause that information is key not just for our investigation, but for improving aviation safety.\u201d\n\nHomendy also described the events that look place inside the plane after the huge bang and explosive cabin depressurization, noting the cockpit door flew open, hitting the lavatory door and sticking there. A checklist for the pilots to refer to in cases of emergency that was laminated to the cockpit in front of them also flew out of the plane and the first officer jolted forward, losing her headset in the process.\n\nThe captain quickly reached for a backup reference handbook in the seat beside him and both he and the first officer put on their oxygen masks and turned on the speaker so they could communicate again with the cabin crew.\n\n\u201cI do want to emphasize that the actions of the flight crew were really incredible,\u201d Homendy said, adding it would have been chaotic and violent, with the wind from the outside being very loud once the door plug was expelled out of the plane.\n\nThe fact there were no people sitting in seats 26A and 26B was just by chance. Seat 26A was twisted and the head rests on seats 25A and 26A were missing. The seat back on 26A was also gone as were some tray tables, although there was no structural damage to the outside of the plane whatsoever.\n\nAll the oxygen masks were also down and some close to the gaping hole had been sheared off. There was also a lot of damage to the interior panelling trim.\n\n\u201cMy impression when I saw that is it must have been a terrifying event to experience,\u201d Homendy said.\n\n(Updates with premarket US trading)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nCan Biden Convince Americans His Brand of Populism Is Better Than Trump\u2019s?

United Launch Alliance\u2019s Vulcan rocket with Astrobotic Technology's lander onboard is launched from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida on Monday, Jan 8, 2024.(NASA via AP) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\n\"Yee haw, I am so thrilled,\" ULA CEO Tory Bruno said in the company's launch control room. \"This has been years of hard work. So far this has been an absolutely beautiful mission.\"\n\nIf all goes well, Peregrine would mark the first U.S. soft landing on the moon since the final Apollo landing in 1972, and the first-ever lunar landing by a private company \u2014 a feat that has proved elusive in recent years.\n\n\"This is the moment we've been waiting for for 16 years,\" Astrobotic CEO John Thornton said. Applause roared in the launch control room when Peregrine was released from its booster stage, setting the golf cart-sized craft on its 46-day journey to the moon.\n\nThe mission is the latest in recent years among countries and private companies sprinting to the moon, a reemergent stage of international competition where scientists hope its water-bearing minerals can be exploited to sustain long-term astronaut missions.\n\nThe launch of Vulcan, a 200-foot (60-m) tall rocket with engines made by Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin, was a crucial first for ULA, which developed the rocket to replace its workhorse Atlas V rocket and rival the reusable Falcon 9 from Elon Musk's SpaceX in the satellite launch market.\n\nThe stakes were high for Vulcan. Boeing and Lockheed, which own ULA in a 50-50 split, have been seeking a sale of the business for roughly a year. And the launch was the first of two certification flights required by the U.S. Space Force before Vulcan can fly lucrative missions for the Pentagon, a key customer.\n\nStory continues\n\nPeregrine is set to land on the moon on Feb. 23 with 20 payloads aboard, most of which will seek to gather data about the lunar surface ahead of planned future human missions. It marks the first trek to the moon's surface as part of NASA's Artemis moon program.\n\nThat multibillion dollar program, involving various countries and relying heavily on private companies such as SpaceX, envisions astronaut missions to the moon later this decade. Small landers such as Peregrine will get there first.\n\nSecond private launch\n\nA second private U.S. company under the same NASA program expects to launch a lander of its own in February. Carrying similar NASA payloads and launching to space aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, Houston-based Intuitive Machines' said its spacecraft could make a moon landing on Feb. 22, a day before Peregrine.\n\nIndia last year became the fourth country to achieve a soft lunar landing after Russia failed in an attempt the same month. The U.S., China and the former Soviet Union are the only other countries that have carried out successful soft lunar landings.\n\nPrivate companies with hopes of spurring a lunar marketplace have had harder times, with Japan's ispace and an Israeli company crash-landing on their first attempts.\n\n(Reporting by Joey Roulette;

Vulcan, which rolled out to its pad on Friday, has spent roughly a decade in development to replace ULA's workhorse Atlas V rocket and rival the reusable Falcon 9 from Elon Musk's SpaceX in the satellite launch market.\n\n\"Now that is a beautiful sight,\" ULA CEO Tory Bruno said on social media platform X, alongside a photo of Vulcan.\n\nULA was formed in 2006 in a merger of Boeing's and Lockheed's rocket programs. The two aerospace giants own the company in a 50-50 split, though they have been seeking a sale of the business for roughly a year.\n\nThat raises the stakes for Vulcan's mission. And the U.S. Space Force, a key customer for Vulcan, sees the launch as the first of two verification flights required before it can put national security payloads aboard.\n\n\"It's really, really important for ULA's forward success... Everything is better for them if it goes well,\" George Sowers, ULA's former chief scientist and one of the architects of its Vulcan program, said of the mission. \"But it's certainly not the end of the world if it doesn't.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nULA's two operational rockets, the Atlas V and giant Delta IV Heavy, are set to retire in the coming years, leaving Vulcan the lone successor to carry on the company's perfect mission success rate. The new rocket already has a multibillion dollar backlog of some 80 missions.\n\nThe Atlas V's retirement was put in place when its Russian-made RD-180 engines - stemming from a partnership established in the 1990's post-Cold War detente - drew concern from U.S. lawmakers after Russia invaded Crimea in 2014.\n\nMeanwhile, SpaceX's insurgent Falcon 9, a reusable launcher offering cheaper rides into Earth's orbit, eroded ULA's monopoly on national security missions. That helped pave the way for Vulcan's development, whose mission price starts at roughly $110 million.

Analysts say a full rollout of the MAX line-up is crucial to help Boeing steady or improve its roughly 40% market share and generate enough cash to comfortably ride out the coming decade.\n\nStory continues\n\nBoeing, saddled with $39 billion in debt, has been reluctant to invest in an all-new plane until engine technology matures in the next decade. Delays to certification of the MAX 10 in particular could put Boeing's 2020s-bridging strategy under renewed pressure, analysts said.\n\nBoeing's struggles also come under the watchful eye of China, a key market broadly closed to the jetmaker in recent years as MAX safety concerns overlapped with trade tensions. Chinese officials sought updates on the Alaska incident on Saturday, sources said.\n\nBoth Boeing and Spirit declined comment.\n\nSince the 737 MAX was grounded in March 2019, Boeing shares have dropped by more than 40% while Airbus shares are up 25%.\n\nThe first clue to the fallout will be how regulators treat certification of the smallest and least-sold version, the MAX 7, which is next up for approval, said Jeff Guzzetti, a former U.S. air crash investigator.\n\nThe FAA is evaluating whether to grant an exemption that would allow the MAX 7 to attain certification before Boeing completes required design changes. The MAX 9 accident could \"swing the pendulum\" toward a rejection, he said.\n\n\"The FAA needs to be seen as strong and on top of things and strict when it comes to safety,\" Guzzetti said. \"The days of any kind of coziness are over.\"\n\nThe FAA said \"safety will determine the timeline\" of ongoing certification projects but declined further comment.\n\nQUALITY ISSUES\n\nAlthough it is too early to identify the cause of the blowout, experts said the investigation could rekindle a debate over recent quality problems if the a production issue was the root cause of the MAX 9 panel dislodging itself.\n\n\"How many production deficiencies and quality escapes do you need before you really start to consider how to wrap your hands around the whole process and cure all of it?\" said Guzzetti.\n\nAlthough Boeing's 737 manufacturing line has evolved, it was never intended to produce 750 aircraft a year, said Michel Merluzeau of AIR Strategic Advisory.\n\nBoeing has introduced robotic systems into 737 manufacturing but is targeting bolder digital reforms in future programs as part of a growing battle over production strategy with Airbus, while still tackling supply chain and labor issues.\n\nPast initiatives that put pressure on suppliers to cut costs, as well as a disconnect between top executives and engineering and manufacturing corps, have added to Boeing's difficulties, said Richard Aboulafia of AeroDynamic Advisories, a longstanding critic.\n\nRecent 737 production setbacks include loose or missing hardware on the rudder system of two MAX jets, improperly drilled holes made by Spirit, and the incorrect attachment of brackets joining the MAX's aft fuselage to its tail.\n\nIn February, Boeing was forced to pause 787 Dreamliner deliveries after a data analysis error was found - a problem Boeing said was unrelated to previous issues that stopped deliveries between 2021 and 2022.\n\nBoeing insists its patience is paying off.\n\n\"Our production system is poised for steady and efficient increases, but we won't push the system too fast and will ensure the supply base is in lockstep with us,\" CEO Dave Calhoun said in October.\n\n(This story has been refiled to remove an extraneous word in paragraph 1)\n\n(Reporting by Valerie Insinna in Washington and Tim Hepher in Paris; Editing by Sandra Maler)", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysis-mid-air-blowout-puts-233702222.html", "symbols": ["AIR.F", "AIR.MC", "AIR.PA", "AIR.XETRA", "AIRA.F", "BA.MX", "BA.US", "BCO.F", "BCO.XETRA", "BOEI34.SA", "EADSF.US", "EADSY.US"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": -0.178, "neg": 0.072, "neu": 0.844, "pos": 0.084}}, {"date": "2024-01-07T21:40:30+00:00", "title": "Explainer: Missing door 'plug' may hold vital clues to how a gaping hole blew open on a jetliner", "content": "Investigators were searching Sunday for the piece of fuselage that blew off a Boeing airliner over Oregon on Friday, hoping to gain physical evidence of what went wrong.\n\nThe gaping hole in the side of the Alaska Airlines jet opened up where aircraft maker Boeing fits a \u201cplug\u201d to cover an emergency exit that the airline does not use.\n\nThe plugs are on most Boeing 737 Max 9 jets. The Federal Aviation Administration has temporarily grounded those planes until they undergo inspections of the area around the door plug.\n\nWHY THE PLUG IS THERE\n\nSome larger Boeing 737s have emergency exits on fuselages behind the wings to meet a federal requirement that planes be designed so passengers can evacuate within 90 seconds even if half the exits are blocked.\n\nThe more passenger seats there are on a plane, the more exits are required.\n\nSome carriers, including Indonesia's Lion Air and Corendon Dutch Airlines, cram more than 200 seats into their Max 9s, so they must have extra emergency exits. However, Alaska Airlines and United Airlines configure their 737 Max 9s to have fewer than 180 seats, so the planes don't need the two mid-cabin exits to comply with U.S. evacuation rules.\n\nOn Alaska and United, the only two U.S. airlines using the Max 9, those side exits near the back of the plane are replaced with a permanent plug the size of an exit door.\n\nARE THEY ONLY ON MAX 9s?\n\nNo. Boeing also makes bigger versions of its 737-900 \u2014 a predecessor to the Max \u2014 and the Max 8 with space for extra exits in the back. Buyers of those planes also may opt to have either exit doors or plugs installed.\n\nWHO INSTALLS THE PLUGS?\n\nA spokesman for Spirit AeroSystems \u2014 which is unrelated to Spirit Airlines \u2014 confirmed to The New York Times that the company installed door plugs on Max 9s, including the plug on the Alaska Airlines plane involved in Friday's incident. The Seattle Times reported that door plugs are assembled into 737 fuselages at Spirit's factory in Wichita, Kansas.\n\nStory continues\n\nSpirit AeroSystems declined to answer questions from The Associated Press. Boeing declined to comment on the issue.\n\nTHE BOEING SUPPLIER\n\nSpirit is Boeing's largest supplier for commercial planes and builds fuselages and other parts for Boeing Max jets. The company has been at the center of several recent problems with manufacturing quality on both the Max and a larger plane, the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. Last year, Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems discovered improperly drilled fastener holes in a bulkhead that keeps 737 Max jets pressurized at cruising altitude.\n\nTHE INVESTIGATION\n\nOfficials with the National Transportation Safety Board, led by the board's chair, Jennifer Homendy, arrived in Portland, Oregon, on Saturday to begin an investigation that is likely to last a year or longer. Homendy declined to discuss possible causes when she briefed reporters on Saturday night.\n\nThe NTSB team includes a metallurgist, and Homendy said investigators will look at the exit-door plug if they can find it, as well as its hinges and other parts.\n\nExamining the damage to the door will be crucial to the investigation, according to independent experts.\n\n\u201cThe good thing about metal is that metal paints a picture, metal tells a story,\u201d said Anthony Brickhouse, who teaches accident investigation at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, Florida. \"I'm pretty confident they will find the piece that came off, and they will be able to speak to scientifically what happened to cause this failure.\u201d\n\nBrickhouse said the exit doors, whether plugged or not, are not necessarily a weak point in the fuselage. He had never heard of an exit door plug falling off a plane before Alaska Airlines flight 1282.\n\nWERE THERE WARNINGS?\n\nAerospace analysts for the investment bank Jefferies wrote that the plane involved in Friday's incident experienced pressurization issues on two earlier flights. The NTSB has not commented on the plane's history, but Homendy said investigators would examine maintenance records even on such a new plane.\n\nOTHER FUSELAGE BLOWOUTS\n\nThere have been rare instances of holes opening in the fuselages of airliners. In most cases, they have been the result of metal fatigue in the plane's aluminum skin.\n\nIn the most horrific case, a flight attendant for Aloha Airlines was blown out of the cabin of a Boeing 737 over the Pacific Ocean in 1988 after an 18-foot-long chunk of the roof peeled away. Her body was never found. The tragedy led to tougher rules for airlines to inspect and repair microscopic fuselage cracks before they tear open in flight.\n\nIn 2009, a hole opened in the roof of a Southwest Boeing 737 flying 35,000 feet over West Virginia. And in 2011, a 5-foot-long gash unfurled in another Southwest Boeing 737, forcing pilots to make an emergency landing at a military base in Arizona. No one was injured in either of those cases, both of which were blamed on metal fatigue.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/explainer-missing-door-plug-may-214030494.html", "symbols": ["ALK.F", "ALK.US", "BA.MX", "BA.US", "BCO.F", "BCO.XETRA", "BOEI34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": -0.967, "neg": 0.055, "neu": 0.908, "pos": 0.037}}, {"date": "2024-01-07T20:53:16+00:00", "title": "What to know about the Boeing 737 MAX 9 panel that blew off in mid-air", "content": "Federal aviation regulators have grounded certain Boeing 737 MAX 9 jets for further inspection after a piece of fuselage tore off the left side of an Alaska Airlines-operated aircraft on Friday, causing the airliner to make an emergency landing after the cabin depressurized.\n\nAfter Alaska Air Flight 1282 took off from Portland, Oregon, en route to Ontario, California, it was at about 16,000 feet of altitude and climbing when it experienced rapid depressurization after a panel that serves as a plug for an emergency exit door used on some variations of the Boeing 737 MAX 9 was torn off. The pilot immediately signaled the plane would have to land, it safely returned to Portland with all 171 passengers and six crew members aboard.\n\nNo serious injuries were reported in the incident, though Alaska reported that some passengers experienced minor injuries that required medical attention \u2013 all of whom were medically cleared after receiving treatment. Nobody was sitting in the seats adjacent to where the door plug blew out according to the airline. Parts of the seat next to the fuselage, including the headrest, were missing.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued a directive Saturday requiring safety inspections of 171 Boeing 737 MAX 9 aircraft operating worldwide. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) dispatched a \"Go Team\" with experts in structures, operations and systems to investigate the incident.\n\nWATCH: ALASKA AIRLINES PASSENGER CAPTURES HORRIFYING MOMENTS AFTER PLANE PART BLEW OFF MIDAIR Certain Boeing 737 MAX 9 airliners have been grounded after a plug door blew off an Alaska flight from Portland, Oregon, to Ontario, California.\n\nThe 737 MAX 9 is Boeing\u2019s largest single-aisle plane and can seat up to 220 people. It includes an optional extra door to allow for the approved number of evacuation paths in cases where carriers choose to install the maximum number of seats on the aircraft.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\nPlanes that aren\u2019t configured to maximize seating capacity can replace that emergency door with a panel, or plug. Door plugs have been used to adapt aircraft and offer flexible layouts across the industry for years.\n\nStory continues\n\nFAA TO TEMPORARILY GROUND CERTAIN BOEING PLANS AFTER ALASKA AIRLINES DOOR BLEW OFF IN MIDAIR\n\nThe fuselage for Boeing 737s is made by Kansas-based Spirit AeroSystems, which separated from Boeing in 2005. Spirit is one of two suppliers that makes the plug doors on the MAX 9, but Boeing also has a key role in the plug installation process, Reuters reported.\n\nThe installation is done in a two-part process involving manufacturing at Spirit\u2019s fuselage plant in Wichita, Kansas, and a Boeing factory outside Seattle, sources told Reuters.\n\nSpirit sends the 737 fuselages by train with the special door assembly \"semi-rigged\" to Renton, Washington, where Boeing typically removes the pop-out doors while loading interiors, then puts the part back to complete installation according to the Reuters report. The hull is then pressurized to 150% to ensure everything is working properly. United and Alaska are the main U.S. air carriers that operate the Boeing 737 MAX 9.\n\nBoeing has delivered 200-plus Boeing 737 MAX 9 planes, of which 171 have a door plug panel instead of an emergency door. Before U.S. airlines can resume flying the planes, the FAA must agree to detailed inspection criteria proposed by Boeing, and it\u2019s unclear if it will do so on Sunday.\n\nU.S. air carriers that use the panel on their 737 MAX 9 airliners are Alaska and United. Alaska halted the use of 18 of its MAX 9 planes on Saturday. On Sunday, it canceled 163 flights, or 21%, and said travel disruptions from the grounding are expected to last through at least mid-week. United canceled 230 flights on Sunday, or 8% of its scheduled departures.\n\nOther carriers that have grounded planes for inspection include Panama\u2019s Copa Airlines, Aeromexico and Turkish Airlines.\n\nBoeing said in a statement shared with FOX Business: \"Safety is our top priority and we deeply regret the impact this event has had on our customers and their passengers. We agree with and fully support the FAA\u2019s decision to require immediate inspections of 737-9 airplanes with the same configuration as the affected airplane. In addition, a Boeing technical team is supporting the NTSB\u2019s into last night\u2019s event. We will remain in close contact with our regulator and customers.\"\n\nAlaska Airlines said in a post on X, formerly, on Saturday: \"As of this morning, inspections on more than a quarter of our 737-9 fleet are complete with no concerning findings. Aircraft will return to service as their inspections are completed with our full confidence.\"\n\nBOEING, FAA URGE OPERATORS TO INSPECT 737 MAX JETS FOR LOOSE BOLT Alaska Airlines will ground its entire fleet of Boeing Co. 737 Max-9 aircraft after a fuselage section in the rear part of the brand-new jet blew out shortly after takeoff.\n\nNational Transportation Safety Bureau (NTSB) chair Jennifer Homendy spoke at a news conference Sunday and referred to what happened as \"an accident, not an incident,\"\n\n\"We are very, very fortunate here that this didn\u2019t end up in something more tragic,\" Homendy said. \"With that said, I imagine this was a pretty terrifying event. We don\u2019t often talk about psychological injury, but I\u2019m sure that occurred here.\"\n\nHomendy declined to speculate about the cause of the accident but noted that the outcome could\u2019ve been much worse if it had occurred once the aircraft reached its cruising altitude.\n\n\"Think about what happens when you\u2019re in cruise. Everybody\u2019s up and walking, folks don\u2019t have seatbelts on. They\u2019re going to restrooms. The flight attendants are providing service to passengers. We could have ended up with something so much more tragic,\" she said.\n\nHomendy also asked the public for help locating the missing door, saying it\u2019s believed to be in the the west side of the Portland metro area near Oregon Route 217 and Barnes Road in the Cedar Mills suburb.\n\nFOX Business\u2019 Landon Mion and Reuters contributed to this report.\n\nOriginal article source:What to know about the Boeing 737 MAX 9 panel that blew off in mid-air", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-boeing-737-max-9-205316359.html", "symbols": ["ALK.F", "ALK.US", "BA.MX", "BA.US", "BCO.F", "BCO.XETRA", "BOEI34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.942, "neg": 0.058, "neu": 0.863, "pos": 0.078}}, {"date": "2024-01-07T20:51:00+00:00", "title": "U.S. Probes Alaska Airlines Door Panel in Boeing Blowout", "content": "The investigation is in its early stages and for now focused on the flight-specific incident rather than a broad problem in the model of the Boeing jet.\n\nContinue reading", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/m/ffa7c087-e578-38f1-af7c-fd60fdf99a4b/u.s.-probes-alaska-airlines.html", "symbols": ["ALK.F", "ALK.US", "BA.MX", "BA.US", "BCO.F", "BCO.XETRA", "BOEI34.SA", "S9Q.F", "SPR.US", "UAL.MX", "UAL1.F"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": -0.026, "neg": 0.086, "neu": 0.831, "pos": 0.083}}, {"date": "2024-01-07T20:22:30+00:00", "title": "What to know about the Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 jet that suffered a blowout", "content": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 An emergency landing by an Alaska Airlines jetliner has prompted U.S. federal authorities to ground some Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft, adding another episode to the troubled history of Boeing's Max lineup of jets.\n\nHere is what to know about the Max 9 plane involved, and what comes next.\n\nWHAT HAPPENED?\n\nAn Alaska Airlines jetliner blew out a portion of its fuselage seven minutes after takeoff 3 miles (4.8 kilometers) above Oregon Friday night, forcing the pilots to make an emergency landing. None of the 171 passengers or six crew were seriously injured but the rapid loss of cabin pressure caused oxygen masks to drop from the ceiling. National Transportation Safety Board Chair Jennifer Homendy said the two seats next to the part that tore off were unoccupied.\n\nHOW ARE FEDERAL AUTHORITIES RESPONDING?\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration ordered the grounding of some Boeing Max 9 operated by U.S. airlines or flown into the country by foreign carriers until they are inspected. The emergency order affects about 171 planes worldwide.\n\nThe NTSB has begun an investigation that is likely to last months and focus on the paneled-over exit door that blew off. The so-called door plug is installed on some jets with fewer seats instead of an emergency exit panel. The jets ordered grounded by the FAA all have those panels installed.\n\nAuthorities are still searching for the door plug, which likely landed near Oregon Route 217 and Barnes Road in the Cedar Hills area west of Portland.\n\nHOW ARE AIRLINES RESPONDING?\n\nAlaska Airlines has grounded its entire fleet of 65 Max 9s for inspections and maintenance. The airline initially kept 18 of its Max 9s in service Saturday because they had received in-depth inspections as part of recent maintenance checks. But the airline pulled those jets from service Saturday night to comply with an FAA directive for all operators of Max9s to conduct specific inspections.\n\nUnited Airlines, the world's biggest operator of Max 9s, has grounded its entire fleet of 79 Max 9s.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlaska and United are the only two U.S. passenger airlines that operate Max 9 aircraft. The companies operate nearly two-thirds of the 215 Max 9 aircraft in service around the world, according to aviation analytics firm Cirium. Six other airlines use the Max 9: Panama's Copa Airlines, Aeromexico, Turkish airlines, Icelandair, flydubai, and SCAT Airlines in Kazakhstan, according to Cirium.\n\nCopa said it had temporarily suspended 21 Boeing 737 Max 9s to comply with the FAA's order.\n\nAlaska Airlines had canceled 163 flights on Sunday, or 21% of its schedule, according to Flightaware. United Airlines had canceled 247, about 9% of its scheduled flights. Not all of the cancelations were necessarily due to the Max 9 crisis.\n\nAlaska Airlines said the groundings had resulted in at least 160 flight cancelations by Saturday evening and disruptions will last through at least mid-week. United had said Saturday evening said the inspections will result in about 60 cancelations.\n\nAlaska Airlines has said affected passengers should go online to view rebooking options and can request a refund. The airline has said passengers whose flights are canceled will be moved the next available flight but they can also request a change or a refund without incurring fees under a flexible travel policy. United Airlines has not instituted a policy specific to the Max 9 inspections but the airline waives change fees for significant delays.\n\nHOW SAFE IS IT TO FLY ON ONE OF THESE PLANES?\n\nFederal officials and airline executives regularly tout the safety of air travel. There has not been a fatal crash of a U.S. airliner since 2009, when a Colgan Air plane operated for Continental crashed near Buffalo, New York, killing all 49 people on board and one on the ground.\n\nAfter arriving in Portland to investigate the Alaska Airlines incident, the NTSB's Homendy said the U.S. has \u201cthe safest aviation system in the world.\u201d However, a surge in close calls between planes at U.S. airports in the past year prompted the FAA to convene a \u201csafety summit\u201d last year, in which officials encouraged airlines and pilots to redouble their attention to careful flying.\n\nThe incident has also renewed questions about the safety of Boeing's Max aircraft, which the newest version of the company's storied 737. There are two versions of the aircraft in service: the Max 8 and the Max 9, which is the larger of the two.\n\nRegulators around the world grounded Max 8 planes for nearly two years after a Lion Air flight crashed in Indonesia in 2018, and an Ethiopian Airlines Max 8 crashed in 2019. Boeing changed an automated flight control system implicated in the crashes.\n\nLast year, the FAA told pilots to limit use of an anti-ice system on the Max in dry conditions because of concern that inlets around the engines could overheat and break away, possibly striking the plane. And in December, Boeing told airlines to inspect the planes for a possible loose bolt in the rudder-control system.\n\nHowever, those past issues are unrelated to Friday's blowout, which is exceedingly rare in air travel, according to Anthony Brickhouse, a professor of aerospace safety at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. Brickhouse said fuselage panels sometimes tears off planes but he could not recall a previous incident that blew a gaping hole like the one that forced Friday's emergency landing.\n\nIn 2018, a passenger on a Southwest Airlines jet was killed in when a piece of engine housing blew off and shattered the window she was sitting next to. However, that incident involved an earlier version of the Boeing 737, not a Max.\n\nWHAT IS BOEING'S RESPONSE?\n\nThe company, based in Arlington, Virginia, issued a brief statement saying \u201cwe deeply regret the impact this event has had on our customers and their passengers.\u201d Boeing said it supported the FAA\u2019s decision to require immediate inspections and said it was providing technical help to the investigators.

(AP) \u2014 Alaska Airlines again grounded all of its Boeing 737 Max 9 jetliners on Sunday after federal officials indicated further maintenance might be required to assure that another inflight blowout like the one that damaged one of its planes doesn\u2019t happen again.\n\nThe airline had returned 18 of its 65 737 Max 9 aircraft to service on Saturday following inspections that came less than 24 hours after a portion of one plane's fuselage blew out three miles above (4.8 kilometers) above Oregon on Friday night. The depressurized plane, which was carrying 171 passengers and six crew members, returned safely to Portland International Airport with no serious injuries.\n\nThe airline said in a statement that the decision was made after receiving a notice from the Federal Aviation Administration that additional work might be needed. Other versions of the 737 are not affected.\n\n\u201cThese aircraft have now also been pulled from service until details about possible additional maintenance work are confirmed with the FAA. We are in touch with the FAA to determine what, if any, further work is required before these aircraft are returned to service,\u201d the airline said.\n\nThe FAA had ordered the grounding of some 737 Max 9s on Saturday until they could be inspected, a process that takes about four hours. The world\u2019s airlines are currently operating about 171 737 Max 9s globally.\n\nThe aircraft make up about 20% of the Alaska Airlines\u2019 fleet. As of midday, Alaska had canceled about a fifth of its Sunday flights, according to FlightAware.com. United Airlines, which also grounded its Max 9s, had about a 10% cancellation rate on Sunday.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board is investigating Friday's accident and is still looking for the door from the paneled-over exit that blew out. Some planes, due to smaller capacity, panel over what would have been an exit door.\n\nThe NTSB has a good idea of where it landed, near Oregon Route 217 and Barnes Road in the Cedar Hills area west of Portland, NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy said at a news conference late Saturday.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cIf you find that, please, please contact local law enforcement,\u201d she said.\n\nIt was extremely lucky that the airplane had not yet reached cruising altitude, when passengers and flight attendants might be walking around the cabin, Homendy said.\n\n\u201cNo one was seated in 26A and B where that door plug is, the aircraft was around 16,000 feet and only 10 minutes out from the airport when the door blew,\u201d she said. The investigation is expected to take months.\n\nThere has not been a major crash involving a U.S. passenger carrier within the country since 2009 when a Colgan Air flight crashed near Buffalo, New York, killing all 49 people on board and one person on the ground. In 2013, an Asiana Airlines flight arriving from South Korea crashed at San Francisco International Airport, killing three of the 307 people on board.\n\nFlight 1282 took off from Portland at 5:07 p.m. Friday for a two-hour flight to Ontario, California. About six minutes later, the chunk of the fuselage blew out as the plane was at about 16,000 feet (4.8 kilometers). One of the pilots declared an emergency and asked for clearance to descend to 10,000 feet (3 kilometers), the altitude where the air would have enough oxygen to breathe safely.\n\nVideos posted by passengers online showed a gaping hole where the paneled-over exit had been and passengers wearing masks. They applauded when the plane landed safely about 13 minutes after the blowout. Firefighters then came down the aisle, asking passengers to remain in their seats as they treated the injured.\n\nThe aircraft involved rolled off the assembly line and received its certification two months ago, according to online FAA records. It had been on 145 flights since entering commercial service Nov. 11, said FlightRadar24, another tracking service. The flight from Portland was the aircraft\u2019s third of the day.\n\nAviation experts were stunned that a piece would fly off a new aircraft. Anthony Brickhouse, a professor of aerospace safety at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, said he has seen panels of fuselage come off planes before, but couldn\u2019t recall one where passengers \u201care looking at the lights of the city.\u201d\n\nHe said the incident is a reminder for passengers to stay buckled in.\n\n\u201cIf there had been a passenger in that window seat who just happened to have their seat belt off, we\u2019d be looking at a totally different news story.\u201d\n\nThe Max is the newest version of Boeing\u2019s venerable 737, a twin-engine, single-aisle plane frequently used on U.S. domestic flights. The plane went into service in May 2017.\n\nThe president of the union representing flight attendants at 19 airlines, including Alaska Airlines, commended the crew for keeping passengers safe.\n\n\u201cFlight Attendants are trained for emergencies and we work every flight for aviation safety first and foremost,\u201d Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants, said in a statement Saturday.\n\nTwo Max 8 jets crashed in 2018 and 2019, killing 346 people and leading to a near two-year worldwide grounding of all Max 8 and Max 9 planes. They returned to service only after Boeing made changes to an automated flight control system implicated in the crashes.\n\nLast year, the FAA told pilots to limit use of an anti-ice system on the Max in dry conditions because of concern that inlets around the engines could overheat and break away, possibly striking the plane.\n\nMax deliveries have been interrupted at times to fix manufacturing flaws. The company told airlines in December to inspect the planes for a possible loose bolt in the rudder-control system.\n\n___\n\nKoenig reported from Dallas. Bohrer reported from Juneau, Alaska.

Turkish Airlines, Panama's Copa Airlines and Aeromexico said they were grounding affected jets.\n\nTypically, whenever planemakers order routine maintenance checks, they get paperwork approved by regulators in advance.\n\nBut because the response to the unexpected Alaska incident was relatively swift, Boeing has not yet secured FAA approval to tell airlines how to carry out the regulator's order.\n\nThe FAA has the final word on how the order is implemented.\n\n\"While those steps are being completed, United has parked all of its 79 737 Max 9s,\" the airline said in a statement.\n\n\"We\u2019ve begun steps such as removing the inner panel to access the emergency door, and begun preliminary inspections while awaiting final instructions,\" it said, adding:\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Inspections can be completed after final procedures are received from the FAA\".\n\nBoeing declined to comment on whether it had submitted its inspection criteria to the FAA, which had no further comment.\n\n'TERRIFYING'\n\nAlaska Airlines on Sunday canceled 163 flights, or 21%, and said travel disruptions from the grounding are expected to last through at least midweek. United canceled 230 flights on Sunday, or 8% of scheduled departures.\n\nThe door plug tore off the left side of an Alaska Airlines jet following takeoff from Portland, Oregon, en route to Ontario, California, forcing pilots to turn back and land safely with all 171 passengers and six crew on board.\n\n\"I imagine this was a pretty terrifying event. We don't often talk about psychological injuries, but I am sure that occurred here,\" National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Chair Jennifer Homendy told reporters on Saturday, adding that it was too early to say what caused the event.\n\nThe panel, put in place on some planes in lieu of an additional emergency exit, is likely to have landed somewhere in the western suburbs of Portland, but has not yet been found. Authorities have asked the public for help finding the panel.\n\nThe accident has put Boeing back under scrutiny as it awaits certification of its smaller MAX 7 as well as the larger MAX 10, which is needed to compete with a key Airbus model.\n\nIn 2019, global authorities subjected all MAX planes to a wider grounding that lasted 20 months after crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia linked to poorly designed cockpit software killed a total of 346 people.\n\nBoeing has delivered 214 of the 737 MAX 9, or 15% of the more than 1,300 MAX aircraft in service, most of which can still fly.\n\n'VERY FORTUNATE'\n\nFriday's Alaska accident is the second to focus attention on the survivability of cabins coming within days of a collision at Tokyo's Haneda airport involving an Airbus A350 and a Japanese Coast Guard plane. No airline passengers were killed in either accident, though five crew on the Coast Guard turboprop died.\n\nIn the Alaska Airlines emergency, NTSB Chair Homendy said the two seats next to the portion of fuselage that blew out were unoccupied. There were some minor injuries, she said.\n\n\"We are very, very fortunate here that this didn't end up in something more tragic,\" Homendy said. Parts of the seat next to the fuselage, including the head rest, were missing.\n\nPortland police and fire departments did not respond to requests for comment on the search.\n\nThe extra exit door is typically installed by low-cost airlines using more seats that require additional evacuation routes.

Turkish Airlines, Panama's Copa Airlines and Aeromexico said they were grounding affected jets.\n\nTypically, whenever planemakers order routine maintenance checks, they get paperwork approved by regulators in advance.\n\nBut because the response to the unexpected Alaska incident was relatively swift, Boeing has not yet secured FAA approval to tell airlines how to carry out the regulator's order.\n\nThe FAA has the final word on how the order is implemented.\n\n\"While those steps are being completed, United has parked all of its 79 737 Max 9s,\" the airline said in a statement.\n\n\"We\u2019ve begun steps such as removing the inner panel to access the emergency door, and begun preliminary inspections while awaiting final instructions,\" it said, adding:\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Inspections can be completed after final procedures are received from the FAA\".\n\nBoeing declined to comment on whether it had submitted its inspection criteria to the FAA, which had no further comment.\n\n'TERRIFYING'\n\nAlaska Airlines on Sunday canceled 163 flights, or 21%, and said travel disruptions from the grounding are expected to last through at least midweek. United canceled 230 flights on Sunday, or 8% of scheduled departures.\n\nThe door plug tore off the left side of an Alaska Airlines jet following takeoff from Portland, Oregon, en route to Ontario, California, forcing pilots to turn back and land safely with all 171 passengers and six crew on board.\n\n\"I imagine this was a pretty terrifying event. We don't often talk about psychological injuries, but I am sure that occurred here,\" National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Chair Jennifer Homendy told reporters on Saturday, adding that it was too early to say what caused the event.\n\nThe panel, put in place on some planes in lieu of an additional emergency exit, is likely to have landed somewhere in the western suburbs of Portland, but has not yet been found. Authorities have asked the public for help finding the panel.\n\nThe accident has put Boeing back under scrutiny as it awaits certification of its smaller MAX 7 as well as the larger MAX 10, which is needed to compete with a key Airbus model.\n\nIn 2019, global authorities subjected all MAX planes to a wider grounding that lasted 20 months after crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia linked to poorly designed cockpit software killed a total of 346 people.\n\nBoeing has delivered 214 of the 737 MAX 9, or 15% of the more than 1,300 MAX aircraft in service, most of which can still fly.\n\n'VERY FORTUNATE'\n\nFriday's Alaska accident is the second to focus attention on the survivability of cabins coming within days of a collision at Tokyo's Haneda airport involving an Airbus A350 and a Japanese Coast Guard plane. No airline passengers were killed in either accident, though five crew on the Coast Guard turboprop died.\n\nIn the Alaska Airlines emergency, NTSB Chair Homendy said the two seats next to the portion of fuselage that blew out were unoccupied. There were some minor injuries, she said.\n\n\"We are very, very fortunate here that this didn't end up in something more tragic,\" Homendy said. Parts of the seat next to the fuselage, including the head rest, were missing.\n\nPortland police and fire departments did not respond to requests for comment on the search.\n\nThe extra exit door is typically installed by low-cost airlines using more seats that require additional evacuation routes.

Parts of the seat next to the fuselage, including the head rest, were missing.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Saturday grounded 171 Boeing 737 MAX 9 jetliners for safety checks after the emergency landing of the plane that had been in service for just eight weeks.\n\nA piece of fuselage tore off the left side of the jet as it climbed following takeoff from Portland, Oregon, en route to Ontario, California, forcing pilots to turn back and land safely with all 171 passengers and six crew on board. Some minor injuries were reported, Homendy said.\n\nThe FAA did not rule out further action as a probe began into the potential structural failure that left a rectangular hole in an area of fuselage reserved for an optional extra door but which is plugged and deactivated on Alaska Air's aircraft.\n\nInvestigators will look at maintenance records, the pressurization system and the door components. Homendy said. \"We'll go where the investigation takes us,\" she said, asking for the public's help in recovering the missing door plug believed to be in a suburb west of Portland.\n\nHomendy praised the FAA for swiftly grounding the MAX 9 to \"ensure continued safety.\"\n\nAlaska Air said it had halted flights by 18 of its MAX 9 planes that it had resumed using Saturday after recent in-depth inspections. The airline said it was in discussions with the FAA \"to determine what, if any, further work is required before these aircraft are returned to service.\" The FAA could announce inspection requirements as early as Sunday, officials said.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Boeing 737 MAX 9s fitted with a special door replacement \"plug\" cannot fly until they are inspected and repaired if necessary, the FAA said.\n\nA section of the fuselage reserved for the optional door had vanished, leaving a neat door-shaped gap.\n\nThe extra door is typically installed by low-cost airlines using extra seats that require more paths for evacuation. However, those doors are permanently plugged, or deactivated, on jets with fewer seats, including those of Alaska Air.\n\nThe fuselage for Boeing 737s is made by Kansas-based Spirit AeroSystems, which separated from Boeing in 2005. Spirit manufactured and installed the particular plug door that suffered the blowout, a source told Reuters on Saturday.\n\nThe MAX 9 represents about 220 of the 1,400 MAX jets delivered so far and most of them have the deactivated door, meaning they are potentially covered by the order.\n\nBoeing said it supported the FAA decision.\n\nMAX planes were grounded worldwide for 20 months after crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia, linked to poorly designed cockpit software, killed nearly 350 people about five years ago.\n\nALASKA, UNITED AFFECTED\n\nAlaska Air and United Airlines are the only U.S. carriers using the MAX 9. Alaska Air canceled 160 flights on Saturday, or 20% of scheduled trips, while United canceled 104 flights or 4% of departures.\n\nAlaska Air said the travel disruptions from the grounding were expected to last through at least mid-week.\n\nBoeing is awaiting certification of its smaller MAX 7 and larger MAX 10, which are needed to compete with the Airbus A321neo model.\n\nBoeing has suffered numerous production issues on the MAX planes in the years since the crashes. The manufacturer on Dec. 28 urged airlines to inspect all 737 MAX airplanes for a possible loose bolt in the rudder control system.\n\nFlight 1282 had reached just over 16,000 feet when the blowout happened, according to FlightRadar24. \"We'd like to get down,\" the pilot told air traffic control, according to a recording posted on liveatc.net.\n\n\"We are declaring an emergency. We do need to come down to 10,000,\" the pilot added, referring to the initial staging altitude for such emergencies, below which breathing is considered possible for healthy people without extra oxygen.

This led to a 20-month grounding of the planes while significant changes were made.\n\nNow, after the fuselage of a brand new 737 Max 9 flown by Alaska Airlines aircraft blew out at 16,000 feet and left passengers clinging to their seats, the future of the brand has been called into question once again.\n\nAlaska Airlines grounded more than 60 737s in an immediate response to the safety failure on Saturday morning, while civil aviation authorities around the globe held talks on the incident.\n\nThe FAA said an investigation was under way, while the country\u2019s National Transportation Safety Board sent a team to inspect the faulty plane.\n\nThe UK Civil Aviation Authority said there were no UK-registered 737 MAX 9 aircrafts but said they would have to be inspected before arriving in British airspace.\n\n\u201cWe have written to non-UK and foreign permit carriers to ask if inspections have been undertaken prior to operation in UK airspace,\u201d it said on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\nThe organisation said it was also monitoring the situation \u201cvery closely\u201d, while Boeing said it \u201cstood ready in support\u201d.\n\nChina\u2019s aviation regulator conducted an emergency meeting to consider a response to the incident, including a possible grounding of the Boeing Max fleet in the country, Bloomberg reported.\n\nChina was the first to ground Boeing\u2019s 737 Max aircrafts after the 2018 and 2019 crashes.\n\nIt comes just a week after the FAA said it was \u201cclosely monitoring targeted inspections\u201d of Boeing 737 Max models \u201cto look for a possible loose bolt in the rudder control system\u201d.\n\nStory continues\n\nFear that company\u2019s value may be impacted\n\nAnalysts said inspections of Boeing\u2019s 737 fleet could weigh heavily on the company and further delay the roll out of its Max 10 \u2013 of which Ryanair has made 150 orders.\n\nNick Cunningham, analyst at Agency Partners, said the valuation of Boeing\u2019s stock rests on it eventually delivering 60 of these planes a month. Currently, it is delivering 20 new and 10 from its warehouse.\n\nMr Cunningham added: \u201cBoeing looks fully valued even if it can pull off 60 of these planes a month, and implicitly therefore, overvalued if it can\u2019t.\n\n\u201cThe company may need to re-inspect and modify lots of its 737 aircrafts [after the incident on Alaska Airlines].

ULA CEO Tory Bruno has said that Vulcan has performed well during recent ground tests.\n\n\"That is an incredibly complicated machine, it's tremendously powerful. Everything has to work,\" Bruno said Saturday at Vulcan's launch pad. \"It is always inherently risky to fly a rocket. But what we're good at is managing that risk.\"\n\nThe mission checklist includes carrying a moon lander that is aiming to make the first U.S. lunar soft landing in half a century. The rocket will be using for the first time engines supplied by Jeff Bezos' space firm Blue Origin.\n\nVulcan's launch also comes as Boeing and Lockheed, which formed ULA in a 2006 merger of their rocket programs, are looking to sell the jointly owned venture, according to three people familiar with the talks.\n\nThe talks have been a complex, drawn-out process for which Vulcan's launch could have crucial implications, said the sources, who asked not to be identified.\n\nULA declined to comment on any potential deal talks. Bruno has previously said his company could be ripe for an acquisition.\n\nStory continues\n\nBoeing and Lockheed declined to comment.\n\nVulcan's debut launch, scheduled for 2:18 a.m. ET (0718 GMT) on Monday, is the culmination of a years-long development effort sprung largely from ULA's need to replace its current Atlas V rocket. That rocket's Russian-imported engines drew criticism from lawmakers that led to its planned retirement.\n\nThe retirement of Atlas - plus Vulcan's other rocket, Delta - will leave the 200-foot-tall (60-m) Vulcan to handle dozens of lucrative missions and serve as the company's sole challenger to SpaceX's reusable Falcon 9.\n\nVulcan's debut mission will send a privately built lander from space robotics firm Astrobotic to the moon. But the launch itself will also serve as the first of two certification flights required by the U.S. Space Force before Vulcan can fly Pentagon satellites.\n\nSpace Force is a core customer for Vulcan - the military branch in 2020 picked ULA's Vulcan and its retiring Atlas V to launch 60% of the Pentagon's missions through around 2027.\n\nPriced lower than its predecessors at roughly $110 million per launch, Vulcan will seek to reclaim market share from Falcon 9, which is priced at roughly $62 million per launch. SpaceX's cheaper flights have eroded ULA's dominance of government satellite launches in the past decade.\n\nVulcan will also compete with Blue Origin's forthcoming New Glenn rocket, which uses the same engines as Vulcan.\n\nACQUISITION TALKS\n\nAcquisition talks for ULA have been underway for more than a year, with dozens of firms, including Blue Origin, having expressed interest, the sources said.\n\nBlue Origin did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nBoeing's and Lockheed's rationale and timing for selling ULA are unclear. But there have been significant changes to the U.S. space industry since ULA's formation in 2006, when it was created to dominate government launches and clinch some commercial demand from the then-nascent satellite market.\n\nGrowth of the commercial market was slower than expected, said Richard McKinney, an aerospace consultant and former director of the Air Force's space acquisition unit until 2007. \"But it looks like we're about there now.\"\n\nAmazon's planned Kuiper network is set to bring in crucial launch revenue for ULA. That has helped provide Vulcan with a multibillion-dollar backlog of roughly 70 missions split somewhat evenly between government and commercial customers, Bruno has said.\n\nVulcan's development and ULA's shift away from its Atlas and Delta rockets have made estimates of the company's valuation hard to pin down, but analysts speculate it could be $2 billion to $3 billion.\n\nBoeing and Lockheed each have their own competing space units. Lockheed, among other pursuits, has ventured into building moon rovers and made strategic investments in ABL Space, a small-launch startup with plans to build larger rockets in the future.\n\nBoeing's space program has struggled, primarily with its long-delayed Starliner astronaut capsule that rivals SpaceX's more established Crew Dragon. Troubles with Starliner development have cost Boeing some $1.5 billion since 2014.\n\nNew ownership could allow ULA to innovate beyond the launch sector in ways its corporate parents were unwilling to allow, former ULA chief scientist Sowers said.\n\n\"The charter of the company was fixed, and it was very limiting,\" he said. \"They're always competing and they couldn't agree on anything. We were not allowed to innovate.\" (Reporting by Joey Roulette; editing by Ben Klayman, Rosalba O'Brien and Leslie Adler)", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-vulcan-rockets-space-debut-202548180.html", "symbols": ["BA.MX", "BA.US", "BCO.F", "BCO.XETRA", "BOEI34.SA", "LMT.MX", "LMT.US", "LMTB34.SA", "LOM.F", "LOM.XETRA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.932, "neg": 0.025, "neu": 0.927, "pos": 0.048}}, {"date": "2024-01-06T20:05:00+00:00", "title": "Alaska Airlines Incident Is Another Blow for Boeing", "content": "The incident is just the latest in a long string of safety issues for Boeing\u2019s 737 MAX, among them two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019.\n\nContinue reading", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/m/7a968f1e-ff67-3932-a55d-3b924ad5cf2c/alaska-airlines-incident-is.html", "symbols": ["ALK.F", "ALK.US", "BA.MX", "BA.US", "BCO.F", "BCO.XETRA", "BOEI34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": -0.178, "neg": 0.112, "neu": 0.799, "pos": 0.089}}, {"date": "2024-01-06T19:32:00+00:00", "title": "FAA Orders Temporary Grounding of Many Boeing 737 MAX-9s", "content": "Alaska Air Flight 1282 was able to return to the Portland airport after losing a portion of its fuselage shortly after takeoff.\n\nContinue reading", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/m/ccdd3f45-14b1-3232-9e71-2d1c07186e98/faa-orders-temporary.html", "symbols": ["ALK.F", "ALK.US", "BA.MX", "BA.US", "BCO.F", "BCO.XETRA", "BOEI34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": -0.382, "neg": 0.106, "neu": 0.894, "pos": 0}}, {"date": "2024-01-06T19:07:50+00:00", "title": "Boeing supports US regulators' order for inspections after Alaska Air incident", "content": "Jan 6 (Reuters) - Boeing said on Saturday it fully supports the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration's decision to require inspections of Max 737-9 planes \"with the same configuration\" as the aircraft that was forced to land late Friday after a cabin panel blowout.\n\nU.S. regulators ordered temporary grounding of 171 Boeing 737 MAX 9 aircraft for safety checks after the blowout on a plane operated by Alaska Airlines.\n\nBoeing also said a technical team is supporting the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board's investigation.

The seat next to the gaping hole had been unoccupied, and other passengers in the row had their seatbelts on.

Aircraft will return to service as their inspections are completed with our full confidence.\"\n\nIn response, one X user wrote that \"an overnight 'inspection' of your MAX fleet gives us no confidence,\" while another asked whether it was Alaska or Boeing that completed the inspection, to which another replied: \"Excellent question given what we know about Lion Air crash.\"\n\nStory continues\n\n737 Max disasters\n\nIn October 2018, a Lion Air 737 Max departing from Jakarta, Indonesia, crashed into the Java Sea shortly after takeoff, killing all 189 people aboard. Then in March 2019, an Ethiopian Airlines 737 Max crashed minutes after taking off from Addis Ababa, killing all 157 passengers and crew.\n\nThe worldwide grounding followed the FAA receiving evidence of similarities between the two accidents. Attention soon turned to a recurring failure in the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), leading to pilot commands being overridden. Investigations later pointed to lapses in certification by the FAA, which was last major aviation authority to ground the aircraft.\n\nAfter mandating changes in design and training, the agency cleared the 737 Max to return to service in November 2020, with other authorities later following suit.\n\nBoeing, in a settlement with the Justice Department in 2021, agreed to pay $2.5 billion to resolve a charge that it had conspired to defraud the FAA. The company later estimated the crisis had cost it about $20 billion.\n\nWith yesterday\u2019s incident, according to Reuters, passenger photos suggest the section of fuselage torn away is sometimes used for an optional rear door\u2014usually by budget airlines that require more evacuation paths due to having more seats. In the case of Alaska Airlines, it said, those doors are permanently plugged.\n\nThere are 215 of the 737 Max 9 in service around the world, according to the New York Times, citing aviation analytics firm Cirium.

The rapid loss of cabin pressure pulled the clothes off a child and caused oxygen masks to drop from the ceiling, but miraculously none of the 174 passengers and six members were injured. Pilots made a safe emergency landing.\n\nHours after the terrifying incident, Alaska Airlines announced that it would ground its entire fleet of 65 Max 9s for inspections and maintenance. CEO Ben Minicucci said Alaska expects the inspections to be completed \u201cin the next few days.\u201d\n\nEven a short grounding will pose significant problems for the airline and its passengers \u2014 the Max 9 accounts for more than one-fourth of Alaska's fleet. On Saturday, Alaska canceled about 100 flights, or 13% of its schedule, by midmorning on the West Coast, according to FlightAware.\n\nUnited Airlines also operates a large fleet of 737-9 Max jets. A United spokesman said Saturday the airline had nothing yet to announce about its Max fleet.\n\nPhotos showed a hole in the Alaska jet where an emergency exit is installed when planes are configured to carry a maximum number of passengers. Alaska plugs those doors because its 737-9 Max jets don't have enough seats to trigger the requirement for another emergency exit.\n\nIndia's aviation watchdog told its airlines to immediately inspect emergency exits of all Boeing 737-8 Max planes, a slightly smaller model than the 737-9 Max. The country's aviation authority complained about a lack of guidance from Boeing.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board said they would investigate Friday's incident.\n\nStory continues\n\nBoeing has offered only a brief statement.\n\n\u201cWe are aware of the incident involving Alaska Airlines Flight 1282,\" the company said Friday night. \"We are working to gather more information and are in contact with our airline customer. A Boeing technical team stands ready to support the investigation.\u201d\n\nThe plane involved is brand-new \u2014 it began carrying passengers in November and has made only 145 flights, according to Flightradar24, a flight-tracking service.\n\nThe Max \u2014 there are currently three versions: the 8, 9 and 10, which differ mainly in size \u2014 is the newest version of Boeing\u2019s venerable 737, a twin-engine, single-aisle plane frequently used on U.S. domestic flights.\n\nMore than a decade ago, Boeing considered designing and building an entirely new plane to replace the 737. But afraid of losing sales to European rival Airbus, which was marketing a more fuel-efficient version of its similarly sized A320, Boeing decided to take the shorter path of tweaking the 737 \u2014 and the Max was born.\n\nA Max 8 jet operated by Lion Air crashed in Indonesia in 2018, and an Ethiopian Airlines Max 8 crashed in 2019. Regulators around the world grounded the planes for nearly two years while Boeing changed an automated flight control system implicated in the crashes.\n\nFederal prosecutors and Congress questioned whether Boeing had cut corners in its rush to get the Max approved quickly, and with a minimum of training required for pilots. In 2021, Boeing settled a criminal investigation by agreeing to pay $2.5 billion, including a $244 million fine. The company blamed two relatively low-level employees for deceiving the Federal Aviation Administration about flaws in the flight-control system.\n\nBoeing has estimated in financial reports that fallout from the two fatal crashes has cost it more than $20 billion. It has reached confidential settlements with most of the families of passengers who died in the crashes.\n\nAfter a pause following the crashes, airlines resumed buying the Max. But the plane has been plagued by problems unrelated to Friday's blowout.\n\nQuestions about components from suppliers have held up deliveries at times. Last year, the FAA told pilots to limit use of an anti-ice system on the Max in dry conditions because of concern that inlets around the engines could overheat and break away, possibly striking the plane. And in December, Boeing told airlines to inspect the planes for a possible loose bolt in the rudder-control system.\n\nA passenger on a Southwest Airlines jet was killed in 2018 when a piece of engine housing blew off and shattered the window she was sitting next to.

No one was seriously hurt.\n\nThe incident occurred shortly after takeoff and the gaping hole caused the cabin to depressurize. Flight data showed the plane climbed to 16,000 feet (4,876 meters) before returning to Portland International Airport. The airline said the plane landed safely with 174 passengers and six crew members.\n\n\u201cFollowing tonight\u2019s event on Flight 1282, we have decided to take the precautionary step of temporarily grounding our fleet of 65 Boeing 737-9 aircraft.\u201d Alaska Airlines CEO Ben Minicucci said in a statement. \u201cMy heart goes out to those who were on this flight \u2013 I am so sorry for what you experienced.\"\n\nEach of the aircraft will be returned to service after full maintenance and safety inspections, which Minicucci said the airline anticipated completing within days.\n\n\"We are working with Boeing and regulators to understand what occurred tonight, and will share updates as more information is available,\" he said.\n\nThe airline provided no immediate information about injuries. However, KPTV reported that according to the Port of Portland, the fire department responded and treated minor injuries at the scene. One person was taken for more treatment but wasn't seriously hurt.\n\nThe plane was diverted about about six minutes after taking off at 5:07 p.m., according to flight tracking data from the FlightAware website. It landed at 5:26 p.m. The pilot told Portland air traffic controllers the plane had an emergency, was depressurized and needed to return to the airport, according to a recording made by the website LiveATC.net.\n\nA passenger sent KATU-TV a photo showing the hole in the side of the airplane next to passenger seats. Video shared with the station showed people wearing oxygen masks and passengers clapping as the plane landed.\n\nStory continues\n\nPassenger Evan Smith was on the flight and described the moment the blowout occurred.\n\n\u201cYou heard a big loud bang to the left rear. A whooshing sound and all the oxygen masks deployed instantly and everyone got those on,\u201d he told KATU.\n\nSmith said a boy and his mother were sitting in the row where the window blew out. The boy's shirt was sucked off him and out of the plane, he said.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board and Federal Aviation Administration said they will investigate the incident.\n\nThe plane involved rolled off the assembly line and received its certification just two months ago, according to online FAA records. The plane had been on 145 flights since entering commercial service on Nov. 11, said FlightRadar24, another tracking service. The flight from Portland was the aircraft's third of the day.\n\nBoeing said it was aware of the incident, working to gather more information and ready to support the investigation.\n\nThe Max is the newest version of Boeing\u2019s venerable 737, a twin-engine, single-aisle plane frequently used on U.S. domestic flights. The plane went into service in May 2017.\n\nTwo Max 8 jets crashed in 2018 and 2019, killing 346 people and leading to a near two-year worldwide grounding of all Max 8 and Max 9 planes. The planes returned to service only after Boeing made changes to an automated flight control system implicated in the crashes.\n\nLast year, the FAA told pilots to limit use of an anti-ice system on the Max in dry conditions because of concern that inlets around the engines could overheat and break away, possibly striking the plane.\n\nMax deliveries have been interrupted at times to fix manufacturing flaws. The company told airlines in December to inspect the planes for a possible loose bolt in the rudder-control system.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press reporter David Koenig in Dallas contributed to this report.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alaska-airlines-flight-makes-emergency-035312343.html", "symbols": ["ALK.F", "ALK.US", "BA.MX", "BA.US", "BCO.F", "BCO.XETRA", "BOEI34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": -0.765, "neg": 0.052, "neu": 0.909, "pos": 0.039}}]
