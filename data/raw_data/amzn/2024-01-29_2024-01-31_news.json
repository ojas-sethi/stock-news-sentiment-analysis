If you wish to skip our detailed overview of Kacher\u2019s history, investment philosophy and hedge fund performance, go directly to Light Street Capital Returned 46% in 2023: Top 5 Picks.\n\nGlen Kacher is the founder and chief investment officer at the hedge fund Light Street Capital. He attended University of Virginia where he graduated with B.S. Commerce at the McIntire School of Commerce. He obtained his MBA from Stanford University.\n\nKacher is among the famous figures in the hedge fund industry. The hedge fund boss, who chose to base his operations in Silicon Valley rather than Wall Street, learned investing from some of the industry\u2019s greatest.\n\nPrior to starting Light Street Capital in 2010, Kacher worked as managing director at the hedge fund Integral Capital Partners under industry titan Roger McNamee. During his time at Integral, which started in 1998, Kacher oversaw investments in the technology sector. His investment areas of focus included software, internet services and media.\n\nBefore he joined Integral, Kacher worked for the hedge fund Tiger Management under Julian Robertson \u2013 a pioneering figure in the hedge fund industry. Kacher went to work for the billionaire legendary hedge fund manager Robertson\u2019s fund after he graduated college with a bachelor\u2019s degree in commerce in 1993 and remained there until 1997.\n\nAt Tiger, Kacher initially worked as a full-time research analyst. At some point, Kacher transitioned to the role of a part-time investment consultant for the hedge fund. During his tenure at Tiger, he focused on investments in hardware, software and networking industries\n\nKacher came to launch Light Street Capital armed with a graduate business degree, years of experience in investing in the technology space and lessons from some of the industry\u2019s best. Kacher\u2019s Light Street Capital is one of the Tiger cubs \u2013 hedge funds whose founders had worked at Tiger Management.\n\nStory continues\n\nLight Street Capital is a tech-focused hedge fund headquartered in Silicon Valley \u2013 the global epicenter of technology innovation. The firm has $680 million in assets under management. Light Street invests by applying long and short investment strategies.\n\nBeing based in Silicon Valley, Kacher has had a vantage view of the technology space, allowing him to better understand industry trends and spot opportunities ahead of others. In Silicon Valley, the Light Street Capital founder rubs shoulders with technology innovators, startup founders, venture capitalists and entrepreneurs.\n\n\"What I learned at business school was that Silicon Valley was the center of the creation of the internet industry\u2026 It seemed crazy to go back to New York.\" Kacher once told Forbes.\n\nThe Silicon Valley insights help guide Kacher\u2019s long and short investment strategies. For example, he takes long positions in industry disruptors and shorts the incumbents. After learning that business travelers preferred ride-hailing services like Uber to traditional rental car services, Kacher went about shorting rental car stocks like Hertz Global Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:HTZ) and made good money out of it.\n\nAlso, Kacher shorts auto parts stocks because he believes that the rise of ride-sharing and electric cars will reduce consumer demand for auto parts.\n\nAs with all other hedge funds, Kacher\u2019s Light Street Capital has had its hits and misses. There are years that it has delivered outstanding returns and years when it has suffered overwhelming losses.\n\nFrom 2010 through 2017, Light Street\u2019s annualized net returns stood at 19.8%. In 2017, the fund delivered returns of 38.6%. In 2018, its returns improved to 53% in the first 10 months of the year.\n\nBut 2021 and 2022 turned out to be punishing years for Kacher. His hedge fund lost 26% in 2021 and things only got worse in 2022 when the fund lost 54%. In 2022, soaring inflation, Russia\u2019s war with Ukraine and rising interest rates combined to hurt technology companies. That dealt a heavy blow to tech-focused hedge funds such as Light Street Capital. Light Street Capital Returned 46% in 2023: Top 15 Picks\n\nGlen Kacher of Light Street Capital\n\nBut the fund made a strong comeback in 2023, returning 46%. In 2023, tech stocks benefited from AI excitement, which led to the blockbuster returns at Light Street Capital.\n\nThe AI theme is expected to continue impacting tech stocks in 2024. In a recent interview with CNBC, Glen Kacher spoke about AI being a multi-decade opportunity.\n\nWhile there will no doubt be ups and downs, the hedge fund boss noted that AI presents a huge tailwind and opportunity for investors. He sees the AI impact on technology companies being as massive as the previous major technology shifts, such as the shift from PCs to networks or SaaS software.\n\nKacher believes that AI presents a massive opportunity for the leaders in the technology sector and that AI is an incredible opportunity for investors to deploy their capital behind.\n\nAs to the best way for investors to get exposure to AI opportunities, Kacher believes that semiconductor stocks present a good opportunity. He notes that NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) are some of the chip companies that are well-positioned to benefit from AI.\n\nSoftware companies are also great opportunities, according to Kacher. The hedge fund boss said that Magnificent Seven companies are best-positioned to ride the AI trend. He noted that these are companies with customers, massive data and massive amounts of capital.\n\nAI is going to be a big deal for the tech industry in 2024. In Davos, industry experts spoke about 2024 being a potentially big year for AI. They noted that 2023 was the year of discovery when AI proved its ability and that 2024 will be the year when focus will be on improving the technology\u2019s reliability so that those adopting it can be more comfortable with it.\n\nApart from AI continuing to attract more money to the technology stocks, the economic outlook also looks promising for tech companies. The Fed appears to have succeeded in cooling off inflation without triggering a recession. Moreover, the Fed is expected to start cutting interest rates in 2024. Technology companies tend to thrive in an environment of low interest rates as borrowing becomes cheap and obtaining capital becomes easy.\n\nAmid the continuing AI excitement and growing optimism over economic outlook as inflation cools and the Fed contemplates rate cuts, stocks are soaring in 2024 with Nasdaq and the S&P 500 hitting all-time highs in January.\n\nIn its latest 13F filing, Light Street Capital revealed large stakes in semiconductor stocks that are expected to benefit from AI-fueled demand. The filing also shows that the fund remains heavily invested in software companies that develop AI tools or stand to benefit from integrating AI systems into their operations.\n\nWith these details in mind, let\u2019s take a look at the top 15 stocks in Glen Kacher\u2019s Light Street Capital portfolio.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nLight Street Capital bounced back in 2023 after the rout of technology companies in 2022 wiped out some 70% of the firm\u2019s assets. The hedge fund benefited from its long positions in some extensive tech stocks that exploded amid the artificial intelligence frenzy. Consequently, we have analyzed the hedge fund 13F filings and settled on its top stock picks. The stocks are ranked in ascending order based on Glen Kacher\u2019s hedge fund\u2019s holdings. Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That\u2019s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\nLight Street Capital Returned 46% in 2023: Top Picks\n\n15. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)\n\nLight Street Capital\u2019s Equity Stake: $11.27 Million\n\nNumber of Hedge fund Holders: 122\n\nSalesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) was one of the stocks behind Light Street Capital returning 46% in 2023. The enterprise software giant is best known for its customer relationship management technology that brings customers and companies together. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)'s service includes sales to store data, monitor leads and progress, forecast opportunities,\n\nSalesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) surged by about 98% in 2023 as benefited from artificial intelligence playing a pivotal role in business operations across multiple industries. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)'s data cloud suite powered by AI continues to gain traction, with companies preparing for the eventual adoption of the technology.\n\nLight Street Capital reduced its holdings in Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) by 44% to $11.27 million. According to data from Insider Monkey's database, a total of 122 elite hedge funds held positions in Salesforce Inc. (NYSE:CRM) stock in the third quarter of 2023. Paul Cantor, Joseph Weiss, and Will Wurm\u2019s Beech Hill Partners was one of the significant shareholder of the company in the fourth quarter of 2023, with shares worth $3.31 million.\n\nHere is what Polen Capital said about Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cIn the fourth quarter, the top relative and absolute contributors to the Portfolio\u2019s performance were Netflix, ServiceNow, and\u00a0Salesforce, Inc.\u00a0(NYSE:CRM).\n\nSalesforce has continued to grow its revenues at what we see as a healthy rate despite market concerns about the impact of the weaker macroeconomy on its business and penetration rates in its core CRM offering. Even its most mature and largest offerings, Sales Cloud and Service Cloud, are still growing revenue at double-digit rates. In addition, management realized that their cost structure, especially in salespeople, had gotten too bloated. Over the past year and a half, the company has run a much more streamlined expense structure that has led to strong operating margin expansion and earnings growth. Importantly, we do not feel Salesforce has cut into its innovation or sales muscle through these cost cuts but has eliminated unnecessary excess fat from the organization.\u201d\n\n14. Synopsys, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNPS)\n\nLight Street Capital\u2019s Equity Stake: $11.49 Million\n\nNumber of Hedge fund Holders: 57\n\nSynopsys, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNPS)\u00a0is a chip design software maker that provides electronic design automation software products to design and test integrated circuits. Synopsys, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNPS)\u00a0has moved to expand its addressable market and boost margin with a $35 billion acquisition of Ansys (NASDAQ:ANSS).\n\nThe acquisition push comes on Synopsys, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNPS)\u00a0rallying by about 55% in 2023 as it benefited from strong demand for its solutions and the artificial intelligence frenzy. Synopsys, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNPS)\u00a0was the latest addition in Light Street Capital\u2019s portfolio following the acquisition of $11.49 million worth of stakes in Q3 2023.\n\nAccording to data from Insider Monkey's database, a total of 57 elite hedge funds held positions in Synopsys, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNPS) stock in the third quarter of 2023. Catherine D. Wood\u2019s ARK Investment Management was one of the prominent shareholder of Synopsys, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNPS) with 36,714 shares worth $18.90 million.\n\nHere is what TimesSquare Capital Management, an equity investment management company, said\u00a0about Synopsys, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNPS) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cAcross the Information Technology universe, we seek companies possessing differentiated capabilities, products, and services. Synopsys, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNPS), a supplier of electronic design automation software for use in designing and testing integrated circuits, edged forward 5%. The company reported a solid fiscal fourth quarter and raised forward guidance. Despite macroeconomic concerns, their customers remain focused on developing next generation semiconductors with their electric design automation tools. We trimmed the position as it approached our price target.\u201d\n\n13. Nerdy, Inc. (NYSE:NRDY)\n\nLight Street Capital\u2019s Equity Stake: $11.93 Million\n\nNumber of Hedge fund Holders: 22\n\nNerdy, Inc. (NYSE:NRDY)\u00a0is a technology company that operates a platform that allows people to learn online. Nerdy, Inc. (NYSE:NRDY)\u2019s purpose-built proprietary platform leverages technology, including AI to connect students, users, parents, guardians, and purchasers of various ages to tutors, instructors, subject matter experts, educators, and other professionals.\n\nNerdy, Inc. (NYSE:NRDY) was up by 47% in 2023 helping propel Light Street Capital into a 46% return. However, the hedge fund trimmed its exposure in the stock by 6% to $11.93 million in Q3 2023.\n\nAccording to the data from Insider Monkey, the number of hedge funds that owned shares of Nerdy, Inc. (NYSE:NRDY) decreased from 25 in the second quarter of 2023 to 22 in the third quarter of 2023, which means that three hedge funds sold their stakes in the company during that period.\n\n12. indie Semiconductor, Inc. (NASDAQ:INDI)\n\nLight Street Capital\u2019s Equity Stake: $11.95 Million\n\nNumber of Hedge fund Holders: 25\n\nindie Semiconductor, Inc. (NASDAQ:INDI)\u00a0is a technology company that provides automotive semiconductors and software solutions for advanced driver assistance systems, autonomous vehicles, and electrification applications.\n\nindie Semiconductor, Inc. (NASDAQ:INDI)\u00a0is benefiting as the digitization of cars rapidly increases thanks to strong demand for electric vehicles and in-cabin infotainment. Indie Semiconductor outperformed the S&P 500 on rallying 34% in 2023 helping propel Light Street Capital to a gain of 46%. Light Street Capital reduced its holdings in indie Semiconductor, Inc. (NASDAQ:INDI)\u00a0by 17% to $11.95 Million.\n\nAccording to data from Insider Monkey's database, a total of 25 elite hedge funds held positions in indie Semiconductor Inc. (NASDAQ:INDI). George Soros\u2019 Soros Fund Management was the most significant shareholder of indie Semiconductor, Inc. (NASDAQ:INDI)\u00a0with shares worth $34.77 million.\n\nIn its Q3 2023 investor letter, Baron Technology Fund\u00a0mentioned Indie Semiconductor, Inc. (NASDAQ:INDI). Here is what it said:\n\n\u201cIndie Semiconductor, Inc.\u00a0is a fabless designer, developer, and marketer of automotive semiconductors for advanced driver assistance systems and connected-car user experience and electrification applications. Shares fell during the quarter due to investor concerns that near-term automotive semiconductor demand will face headwinds because of excess inventory in the automotive semiconductor supply chain, combined with third quarter revenue guidance that slightly missed consensus expectations due to a customer slightly delaying the launch of a new vehicle model where indie had secured a design win (so delayed, not lost sales). As indie steadily ramps new product and design wins into production, we are confident the company will achieve its targeted model of profitability by year end, while effectively doubling revenues as it delivers on its $4.3 billion and growing strategic backlog. We believe indie has the potential to grow from its $200 million revenue run rate today to its targeted $500 million by 2025 and $1 billion by 2028. In the years ahead, indie should benefit as it develops differentiated, highly integrated, energy-efficient products, while the automotive semiconductor vertical remains highly attractive over the long term.\u201d\n\n11. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nLight Street Capital\u2019s Equity Stake: $15.17 Million Number of Hedge fund Holders: 286\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a multinational technology company with diverse business interests. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) operates an e-commerce platform that connects merchants and consumers worldwide.\n\nAs Light Street Capital returned 46% in 2023, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u00a0was one of the key drivers as the stock rallied 54% and benefited from robust growth in its core business. AWS recorded a 12% year-over-year increase in sales to $23.1 billion. Light Street Capital Increased its stakes in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u00a0by 6% in Q3 2023 to $15.17 million.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey's database data, 286 elite hedge funds held positions in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), up from 278 in the previous quarter. Notably, Paul Cantor, Joseph Weiss, and Will Wurm\u2019s Beech Hill Partners emerged as one of the significant stakeholder in the company, with 52,700 shares valued at $8 million.\n\nIn its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter, Polen Capital stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN):\n\n\u201cFor the full year, the top relative and absolute contributors were\u00a0Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Salesforce, and ServiceNow. Amazon shares appreciated 88% in 2023, driven primarily by rapidly expanding operating profit margins and free cash flow growth. After the pandemic, Amazon experienced a period of inefficiency and overinvestment in its distribution and logistics infrastructure. Amazon is now leveraging these investments as growth returned to its e-commerce business in 2023 after a highly unusual 2022. At the same time, Amazon\u2019s rapidly growing and high-margin advertising business is contributing strongly to the entire company\u2019s operating profit growth. The AWS (Amazon Web Services) cloud infrastructure and services business continued to slow in 2023 as customers anticipating a more difficult economic environment looked to save money on their cloud spend, but these cloud spending optimizations began to stabilize in the second half of 2023. We now expect customer interest in generative AI will begin to contribute to growth.\u201d\n\n10. Cellebrite Di Ltd. (NASDAQ:CLBT)\n\nLight Street Capital\u2019s Equity Stake: $15.74 Million\n\nNumber of Hedge fund Holders: 23\n\nCellebrite Di Ltd. (NASDAQ:CLBT) is a software infrastructure company that develops solutions for legally sanctioned investigations. Its DI suite of solutions allows users to collect, review, analyze, and manage digital data across the investigative lifecycle concerning legally sanctioned investigations.\n\nCellebrite Di Ltd. (NASDAQ:CLBT) was one of the best-performing stocks in the Light Street Capital portfolio as it rallied by 95% in 2023, outperforming the 24% gain for the S&P 500 over the same period.\n\nThe hedge fund benefited from the rally, having first bought a stake in Cellebrite Di Ltd. (NASDAQ:CLBT) in Q3 2021 and ended up with stakes worth $15.74 million as of Q3 2023.\n\nFor their Q3 2023 shareholdings, 23 of the 910 hedge funds profiled by Insider Monkey held a stake in Cellebrite DI Ltd (NASDAQ: CLBT). Catherine D. Wood\u2019s ARK Investment Management was a remarkable shareholder of Cellebrite Di Ltd. (NASDAQ:CLBT) with stakes worth $2.26 million.\n\nHere is what Greenhaven Road Capital said about Cellebrite DI Ltd. (NASDAQ:CLBT) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cCellebrite DI Ltd.\u00a0(NASDAQ:CLBT)\u2013 Cellebrite provides tools to law enforcement to extract data (evidence) from cell phones, analyze the data, and manage the data. Solving many crimes without their tools is inconceivable. They are mission critical. One of the best indicators of business quality is pricing power. The ability to raise price only comes with attributes such as high switching costs and a limited competitive landscape. Cellebrite benefits from both, but has not aggressively flexed their pricing power to date. After being acquired by private equity, the company\u2019s competitor, Grayshift, has reportedly been raising prices by more than 30% on select products. Cellebrite is taking more of a velvet glove approach, offering newer products with more functionality at higher prices, e.g., their \u201cPremium\u201d offering, which offers additional features and is, in fact, \u201cpremium\u201d but is also 40-50% more expensive. The combination of raising prices, introducing new products, and cross-selling analytics products should fuel growth for the next several years. Extracting data from devices and making sense of it is not going to get easier nor is it going to become less mission-critical. Law enforcement needs tools to fight crime, and Cellebrite is the leading \u201carms dealer\u201d to collect and review data from mobile phones.\n\nOver the course of the quarter, Cellebrite hired an Executive Chairman from the private equity firm Vista Equity Partners. It will be interesting to see if he can apply any of the \u201cVista playbook\u201d to Cellebrite operations, and if he can help put some of the $230M+ in cash that Cellebrite has on its books to work via acquisitions. At just over 3x 2024 revenue and profitable, Cellebrite is priced at a significant discount to peers, as if growth will evaporate. I suspect that, over time, growth occurs and multiple expands, or a firm like Vista Equity Partners acquires them.\u201d\n\n9. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)\n\nLight Street Capital\u2019s Equity Stake: $15.79 Million\n\nNumber of Hedge fund Holders: 81\n\nTesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)\u00a0is a pioneer electric vehicle company that designs, develops, manufactures and sells zero emission motor vehicles, energy generation and storage systems. . Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s automotive segment is known for electric cars, while the energy generation and storage segment designs, manufactures, and sells solar energy generation and energy storage products.\n\nWhile Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)\u00a0was under pressure late last year, it still finished the year up 123%, helping Light Street Capital return 43%. Nevertheless, the hedge fund trimmed its stakes in Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)\u00a0by 42% in Q3 2023 to $15.79 million.\n\nFor their September quarter of 2023 shareholdings, 81 out of the 910 hedge funds part of Insider Monkey's database were Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)\u00a0investors. Catherine D. Wood\u2019s ARK Investment Management was one of the significant shareholder of Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)\u00a0with stakes worth $944.85 million in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nTsai Capital Corporation, an investment management firm, mentioned Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)\u00a0in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\n\u201cTesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) ($248.48 \u2013 up 101.7% for the year. Recent high $299.29): Tesla has significant and underappreciated competitive advantages across multiple verticals including electric vehicles, software and energy storage. Misunderstood by much of Wall Street \u2013 and consequently a favorite of short sellers \u2013 Tesla continues to grow rapidly and increase its lead over the competition while delighting consumers in the process. Despite his unconventional (and sometimes off-putting) personality, Elon Musk is a visionary who has created enormous shareholder value. Musk is also a long-term thinker who has embraced the scale-economies-shared business model favored by Henry Ford and Jeff Bezos, intentionally reducing prices, increasing the customer value proposition and expanding the total addressable market. Tesla\u2019s massive scale and cost advantages are now challenging the viability of legacy auto, which has hundreds of billions of dollars of outdated property, plant and equipment in a world that is rapidly transitioning to electric vehicles (EVs). While we expect competition for EVs to intensify and for Tesla to lose market share over time, we also believe the company will increase production and deliveries from approximately 1.8 million vehicles today to approximately 15 million vehicles in 2030 and further its lead in autonomous driving capability. In fact, we expect Tesla will eventually license its autonomous driving software, creating high-margin (70-80%), recurring licensing revenue. Tesla is also one of only two companies that dominate the energy storage market, which has the potential to grow to several hundred billion in revenue as power plants around the world increase their focus on renewable energy. Our investment in Tesla is aligned with our preference for companies that have strong balance sheets and the managerial skill to reinvest capital at high rates of return into large addressable markets.\u201d\n\n8. JFrog Ltd. (NASDAQ:FROG)\n\nLight Street Capital\u2019s Equity Stake: $15.85 Million\n\nNumber of Hedge fund Holders: 30\n\nBased in Sunnyvale, California, JFrog Ltd. (NASDAQ:FROG)\u00a0is a software development company that offers a platform that allows enterprises to manage the way they develop and release software updates. JFrog Artifactory is a package repository that allows teams and organizations to store, update, and manage their software packages at any scale.\n\nJFrog Ltd. (NASDAQ:FROG)\u00a0was up 34% in 2023, turning out to be one of the performers as Light Street Capital returned 43%. The hedge fund increased its exposure in JFrog Ltd. (NASDAQ:FROG)\u00a0by 11% in Q3 2023 to stakes worth $15.84 million.\n\nInsider Monkey's third quarter of 2023 survey covering 910 hedge funds revealed that 30 institutional investors had invested in JFrog Ltd. (NASDAQ:FROG), up from 27 in the previous quarter.\n\nHere is what Madison Investments said about JFrog Ltd. (NASDAQ:FROG) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cIn the third quarter, we added two investments to the portfolio (FROG and HAYW). Software provider JFrog Ltd. (NASDAQ:FROG) sells software tools to the Dev/Sec/Ops space (Development, Security and Operations). Their software forms a critical component of the software development chain. Essentially, large enterprises use FROG\u2019s tools to develop, secure and operate their software infrastructure. We believe J Frog is a very strategic asset that dominates its niche. The company is profitable, with recurring revenues that drive material cash flow, buttressed with a strong balance sheet.\u201d\n\n7. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\n\nLight Street Capital\u2019s Equity Stake: $17.31 Million\n\nNumber of Hedge fund Holders: 87\n\nPalo Alto, California-based Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\u00a0designs, develops, and supplies semiconductor devices. The network chipmaker was one of the stocks that exploded as investors snapped up stocks tied to the artificial intelligence boom last year.\n\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\u00a0nearly doubled in value after rallying by 98% as it delivered better-than-expected financial results bolstered by AI-related sales growth.

The hedge fund added the stock into the portfolio by acquiring stakes worth $17.31 million in Q3 2023.\n\n87 out of the 910 hedge funds part of Insider Monkey's database had bought Broadcom Inc.

Paul Cantor, Joseph Weiss, and Will Wurm\u2019s\u00a0Beech Hill Partners was one of the prominent investor via its $3.79 million stake.\n\n6. Alphabet Inc.

(NASDAQ:GOOG)\u00a0is a communication services company but is often billed as a technology juggernaut, given its vast product line. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u00a0is also involved in the retail of electronic devices, including smartphones, ultra-thin notebooks, and speakers.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u00a0exploded in 2023, rallying by about 56% as it also benefited from the artificial intelligence boom and overall market bullishness. Light Street Capital reduced its holdings in Alphabet Inc.

One of the prominent stakeholder in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in the fourth quarter of 2023 was Catherine D. Wood's ARK Investment Management, which had $29.21 million stakes in the firm.\n\nEnsemble Capital Management made the following comment about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q4 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cAlphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG) (8.52% weight in the Fund): Google\u2019s earnings report in October showed its core advertising business accelerating to double digit growth as the digital advertising recession of 2022 and early 2023 fades away. However, the company\u2019s Cloud division, which is expected to generate growth from selling access to artificial intelligence services, saw its growth rate slow modestly. Juxtaposed with Microsoft\u2019s Cloud business seeing growth pick up slightly, investors sold off Google\u2019s stock on the report. While the stock recovered to new highs by the end of the year, the earnings report set back caused the stock to trail behind the S&P 500 with a gain of 6.8% for the quarter.\u201d\n\nClick to continue reading and see Light Street Capital Returned 46% in 2023: Top 5 Picks.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n20 Best Countries for English Speakers to Work 35 Richest Countries by Median Income 20 Safest Countries for US Travelers in the World\n\nDisclosure: None.

With the growing adoption of Artificial Intelligence and the massive demand for data centers, several companies are making the most of this phase and reporting impressive revenue numbers. While Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is already an industry leader, and it can become difficult to match its rally, other tech stocks are slowly but steadily expanding their market share and could report impressive numbers in the coming weeks. The earnings season is an ideal time to invest in stocks that show high growth potential. Here are the three tech stocks post-earnings ready for take-off. Grab them before they are gone!\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe biggest competitor of Nvidia this year could be the year of\u00a0Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). The company has faced several challenges in the past but its recent fourth-quarter results are impressive. It beat analyst expectations, and the revenue saw a 10% year-over-year increase to $6.2 billion. The net income hit $667 million, which is a significant rise from $21 million in the same quarter the prior year.\n\nThis is an impressive feat, and there is no stopping AMD. Higher revenue and improved profits are driven by the improvement in the data center segment and the company\u2019s ability to focus on the core business areas. The data center saw a 38% year-over-year increase in the fourth quarter, and I believe the company is only getting started. This is a sign that the company\u2019s new products have got a positive response and it could enjoy a robust performance in the market.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe stock has the potential to double in the coming months. It might not be able to enjoy a rally like Nvidia, but it can generate significant gains. AMD has already positioned itself as one of the best alternatives for Nvidia chips with the new chip launch.\n\nStory continues\n\nSeveral tech giants including\u00a0Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), have shown interest in using AMD chips. It also enjoys a price advantage over Nvidia\u2019s chips. AMD has a diverse range of products that meet the needs of every consumer. Improved revenue stream and higher adoption of the chips will help AMD soar to new highs this year. Buy the stock before it skyrockets.\n\nOracle (ORCL) The Oracle (ORCL) sign hangs on an Oracle office in Deerfield, Illinois.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nOracle (NYSE:ORCL) is a tech giant, and the company has been a winner in the AI space. It already has an established market and is known for its database software which is growing due to generative AI offerings. The company has seen strong demand for its cloud services and saw a significant 52% revenue jump in the cloud infrastructure for the third quarter which came in at $1.6 billion. One big reason to invest in Oracle stock is its partnership with Microsoft Azure, where it is ramping up the data centers and building new ones.\n\nThe future of Oracle is cloud, and this is where it will achieve success. I am expecting record quarterly revenue from the company, and the stock could take off after the earnings. ORCL stock is up by 8% year to date. Once the company reports results, we could see the stock soar. It also boasts a modest dividend yield of 1.40%.\n\nI consider Oracle to be a safe haven stock and have recommended it in the past as well. Since most of its success comes from cloud infrastructure services, it is here to stay and has become highly reliable in terms of revenue growth. The company is aggressively building data centers, and as it scales up the cloud segment, we could see an improvement in the operating margin.\n\nAfter the quarterly results, the management mentioned that the demand for its data centers was\u00a0\u201castronomical\u201d and this is something to be excited about. Oracle is now stronger than ever, and this is the time for cloud computing businesses. You will regret not buying this stock.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the best tech stocks to add to your portfolio,\u00a0Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is known as a global e-commerce giant, but it is so much more than that. It has become more of a tech company today and is using AI to leverage sales.\n\nWhile Amazon needs no introduction, its subsidiary, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the largest cloud services company in the world with a massive market. The company might have announced results while you read this, and I am certain that the positive numbers will take the stock on an upward momentum. I believe Amazon will report an exceptional quarter driven by Prime Day, holiday shopping, and a rise in advertising revenue.\n\n2024 could be a stellar year for the company as it shows positive signs of growth with rising demand for AWS. In the\u00a0third quarter results, AWS revenue increased 12% year over year to hit $23.1 billion, and with the generative AI offerings, we should expect the same level of growth to continue in 2024. The total operating income in the quarter was $11.2 billion out of which $7 billion was from AWS. I am highly optimistic about the future of Amazon and believe it will soar this year.\n\nThe stock is up by 52% in the year and is close to the 52-week high of $161. The stock hasn\u2019t moved much over the past month but could take off post-earnings. This is one blue-chip stock to buy and hold forever.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to 5 Most Innovative Economies in 2024: Why WIPO Rankings Are Inaccurate.\n\nVarious researchers have defined innovation as an indicator of national competitiveness. While others linked it to the economic growth of a country. However, many factors contribute to a country's innovation, including its research and development and ability to adopt technologies and produce market-competitive products and services.\n\nWhy WIPO Rankings Are Inaccurate\n\nThe Global Innovation Index is considered a significant tool for identifying the most innovative country, by utilizing a variety of indicators. While GII might be an established index to provide a holistic view of innovation in a country, some of its indicators, such as institutions and other governance and infrastructure indicators, do not have a direct impact on innovation, compared to prominent indicators such as R&D or innovative technology product exports. This is what makes the WIPO ranking inaccurate as it equally weights all the factors to compute a final innovation index, instead of prioritizing factors that directly impact the scientific and technological innovations in a country.\n\nThe GII ranks Switzerland as the most innovative country in the world. While Switzerland has made significant progress in science and technology in the past years, the United States is undoubtedly the most innovative economy in the world. As of 2023, the US boasts a GDP of $26.95 trillion and is a leader in science and technology. More than 75% of the most innovative companies in the world are based in the US. The country is home to some of the top universities and research institutes including MIT, Harvard, and Stanford University, among others. The United States also stands as a global leader in sectors including health, finance, and energy, among others. The US is tentatively the biggest research and development spender in the world. It spent a total of $789 billion in R&D in 2021, up $72 billion from 2020. On the other hand, Switzerland reported a total spending of only $35 billion in 2022. These factors combined, position the United States as the most innovative country in the world.\n\nStory continues\n\nCompanies Contributing to the Innovation in the US\n\nCompanies including Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) are ruling the US market with their continued innovation and scientific breakthroughs.\n\nWall Street is bullish on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). On January 22, Benchmark analyst Daniel Kurnos raised his price target on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) to $175 from $170 and reiterated a buy rating. Over the past 3 months, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has received 37 buy ratings from analysts. The stock has an average price target of $187.40 and a high price target of $220. As of January 31, the stock has surged more than 50% over the past 12 months.\n\nHere are some of the comments from Amazon.com, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AMZN) Q3 2023 earnings call:\n\n\"During the quarter, we hosted Amazon Accelerate, our annual seller conference, where we launched a number of new innovations and product developments for our sellers, including Supply Chain by Amazon. We also continue to see durable growth in advertising which grew 25% year-over-year, excluding foreign exchange, primarily driven by sponsored products as we lean into machine learning to improve the relevancy of the ads we show our customers and enhance our measurement capabilities on behalf of advertisers. We have seen strong improvement in our profitability. North America operating income was $4.3 billion, an increase of $4.7 billion year-over-year, resulting in an operating margin of 4.9%, up 100 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Since North America operating margins bottomed out in Q1 of 2022, we have now seen 6 consecutive quarters of improvement, resulting in a cumulative improvement of over 700 basis points over these past 6 quarters.\"\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is a powerhouse of innovation with its top-notch AI-integrated tools. The company promotes the integration of AI in business processes and daily life to accelerate innovation. On September 27, 2023, the company announced several AI-assisted features across its devices and applications, including AI stickers and editing tools and a conversational AI assistant called Meta AI. Moreover, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is set to launch AI characters and AI studios and creation tools in 2024.\n\nOn January 23, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) launched Chrome M121 along with experimental generative AI features. The new features will allow efficient browsing and personalized experience for users. The new generative AI features will be available in Chrome on Macs and Windows PCs soon, starting first in the US. The users can navigate to the experimental AI page by going to the settings option in their Chrome account.\n\nWith this context, let's look at the 25 most innovative economies in 2024. 20 Most Competitive Economies In The World\n\n20 Most Competitive Economies In The World\n\nMethodology\n\nFor our article, we defined an innovative country as one that invests highly in research and development and integrates digital technology into its economy. To rank the 25 most innovative economies in 2024, we employed three metrics including R&D Expenditure, High Technology Exports in US$, and Digital Adoption Index (DAI). High technology exports showcase a country's ability to transform its R&D into commercial products and services competing globally. This provided us with a solid framework to identify and rank the most innovative economies in 2024.\n\nFirstly, we sorted the countries based on R&D expenditure and collated a list of 40 countries. Then, we sourced DAI and high-technology exports data of the countries. Then, we assigned ranks to our countries based on each metric, with 1 representing the most innovative country. Finally, we assigned weights to each of our metrics as 40% to R&D Expenditure, 40% to High Technology Exports, and 20% to DAI and computed a weighted average of each country's rank across these metrics to calculate their final score as 'Insider Monkey Score'. Our list ranks the countries in descending order of the calculated score.\n\nOur list does not include Israel due to the current geopolitical situation in the country. Israel's war on Gaza has caused major economic losses in the country disrupting businesses, which makes it challenging to assess its innovation. Hence, we have only included countries that demonstrate resilience and adaptability to foster innovation amidst global political challenges.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

According to the Commerce Department's report on economic growth, the US economy expanded by 3.1% year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2023, driven by robust consumer spending on healthcare, dining out, and automobiles. Additionally, holiday season sales surpassed expectations, reaching $964.4 billion during November and December, according to data from the National Retail Federation.\n\nThe strength of the US economy, coupled with the possibility of future rate cuts, has emboldened market bulls to make more optimistic predictions and set higher targets for the S&P 500. For instance, Katie Stockon, founder and managing partner of Fairlead Strategies, suggested on CNBC that the S&P 500 could potentially reach 6,100 in the long term if new highs are achieved. Despite some stocks being overbought, Stockon noted signs of strength in the market, indicating the beginning of a bull market. Furthermore, Lori Calvasina from RBC Capital Markets remarked in December that while the market is expected to grow gradually in the second half of 2024, investors may need to pause to digest the significant gains witnessed in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nIn such an environment, potential investors looking to dip their feet in the stock market often seek out low-cost yet potentially lucrative stocks to navigate the world of finance. While these stocks may not provide the same level of security as mega-cap firms like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc.

Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years\u00a0(see the details here). That\u2019s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n15. The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR)\n\nShare Price as of January 27: $46.30\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 41\n\nThe Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR), commonly known as Kroger, is a prominent American retail corporation operating an extensive network of supermarkets and multi-department stores across 35 states in the United States. With a presence in over 2,700 supermarkets and multi-department stores, The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) holds a significant position in the global food retail industry.\n\nKroger Co (NYSE:KR) disclosed its third-quarter financial results earlier in November of 2023. The company reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.95 for the period, surpassing expectations by $0.03. Additionally, the reported revenue stood at $33.96 billion, exceeding estimates by $60 million.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 41 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had investments in The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR), representing a slight decline from 43 in the previous quarter. The collective value of these stakes amounted to over $3.13 billion.\n\nOakmark Funds funds mentioned The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) in its Q3 2023 investor letter.\u00a0Here is what the firm has to say:\n\n\u201cThe Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) is the second-largest grocery retailer in America behind only Walmart. Although the grocery industry is highly competitive, Kroger\u2019s scale advantages allow it to offer a more compelling value proposition than smaller peers and earn higher returns on capital. In recent years, the market has assigned Kroger a lower multiple due to concerns that e-commerce would disrupt traditional brick-and-mortar grocery. However, we believe the company\u2019s performance through the pandemic highlighted that its store footprint, distribution infrastructure, technology investments and strong brand all position the company well for a world with higher online grocery adoption. The stock trades for just 10x our estimate of next year\u2019s EPS, which we believe is attractive given Kroger\u2019s competitive positioning and earnings growth outlook. The pending merger with Albertsons has the potential to drive accelerated earnings growth and further scale advantages. If the merger is not approved, the company will have the capacity to return approximately 25% of its market cap to shareholders.\u201d\n\nMuch like CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS), Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) ranks as one of the best cheap stocks to buy.\n\n14.

In 2019, BMY acquired Celgene, who had one of the better corporate development programs in the industry. We view this as a great outlet for us as generalists considering a company like BMY should truly thrive with the ability to acquire outstanding assets and science at depressed valuations. We touched on the Turning Point acquisition above and we expect the company to be increasingly active in the M&A landscape. Importantly, Celgene also came to BMY with a phenomenal CAR-T platform. CAR-T is a cell therapy that activates the body\u2019s immune system to target cancers. This will be a key growth vector alongside M&A in overcoming the company\u2019s patent cliff.\u201d\n\n8.

During their conversation, Murray and Jassy talked about 2024\u2019s biggest opportunities and risks. There was one topic that stood out above all others, just as it did for all the other CEOs at the dinner: generative AI. The one question Jassy wouldn\u2019t answer: How his leadership style differs from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.\n\nLeadership Next co-host Michal Lev-Ram joins Murray for the pre-interview chat.\n\nListen to the episode or read the transcript below.\n\nTranscript\n\nAlan Murray: I can't believe this crowd has this much energy this late in the week after a full Davos. [Applause from the crowd.]\u00a0 So, congrats. Yeah. I want to thank all of you for coming to the best dinner in Davos. [More applause.] This has been proven by AI [laughter from crowd]: Best dinner, best people, best conversation. So, I'm really glad that you've given us some of your time.\n\n[Music.]\n\nLeadership Next is powered by the folks at Deloitte who, like me, are exploring the changing rules of business leadership and how CEOs are navigating this change.\n\nWelcome to Leadership Next.\n\nMichal Lev-Ram: The podcast about the changing rules of business leadership.\n\nMurray: I'm Alan Murray and\u2026\n\nLev-Ram: I'm Michal Lev-Ram.\n\nMurray: Welcome to the fifth season of Leadership Next, Michal. I can't believe we've been doing this for four years and have a fifth to go.\n\nLev-Ram: We're so old. [Laughter.] That's pretty awesome.\n\nMurray: We've had a lot of CEOs from a lot of the best-known companies in the world on over the course of those four years. But one thing we have never had, until this episode, is the CEO of Amazon, the number two company on the Fortune 500 list, vying for one of the most valuable companies in the world. Jeff Bezos alluded us, but recently Andy Jassy joined Fortune at our annual CEO dinner in Davos.\n\nStory continues\n\nLev-Ram: Speaking of Bezos, by the way, I think he only talks space these days. So, unless we do an episode devoted to that, we're not getting him.\n\nMurray: I\u2019m in.\n\nLev-Ram: It would be cool. It would be cool. In your view, what was different about Bezos as a leader and Jassy? And obviously it's a different era now for Amazon.\n\nMurray: What I've been told and what I've observed is Bezos is famous for his customer obsession. Everything was about the customer. You read the letter that he wrote every year, it\u2019s customer, customer, customer. And I think he reached the point where employees started to feel like they were chopped liver saying, \u201cHey, wait a minute.\u201d Yeah, the customer is important, but what about us? And I do think Jassy has changed the approach a little bit, is perceived as a little more employee friendly, a little more focused on a variety of stakeholders and not relentlessly focused on technology and customers at the cost of everything else. But what was interesting in the interview, I made several attempts to get him to compare himself to his predecessor. He absolutely refused to take the bait. He was not going to play that game no matter how hard I tried.\n\nLev-Ram: Tell us about Davos. How was it this year? What was different? What stood out?\n\nMurray: You know, it's such a strange experience because you get this incredible concentration of CEOs and other prominent people. The president of Poland was there, President Zelensky from Ukraine was there, the secretary of state from the U.S., the premier from China, all in this tiny little ski town in Switzerland. And you know, you run into them walking across the street, etc. We, for nine years, have gathered together the CEOs who were in town for a dinner on the Thursday night of the event. Andy Jassy has attended a couple of times in the past. He agreed to come and be the opening interview and then we had table discussions with all of the CEOs where they talked about the same thing that Andy did, which was what are the big opportunities and the big risks that lie ahead in 2024? And what you're going to hear is that number one on that list and probably number two, number three and number four on that list is AI.\n\nLev-Ram: Well, I know he also brought up beef tournedos. Can you explain what that is?\n\nMurray: There was a menu on the seats in front of us and he saw beef tournedos and was trying to figure out what that meant. Thought it must be beef twisted like a tornado here. I'm Googling it right now. It's just pan-seared beef.\n\nLev-Ram: Okay. I thought it\u2026\n\nMurray: \u2026dressed in a red wine mushroom sauce.\n\nLev-Ram: So your challenge now is\u2026\n\nMurray: I don't know.\n\nLev-Ram: So your challenge now is to work this into some kind of metaphor for the economy. The economy is in a beef tournedo. You know, it's interesting, Amazon, obviously, I mean, we think of it as the everything store. It's the everything company, right? It is just mind boggling how much we interact with Amazon and its various brands.\n\nMurray: He talked about that. He talked about different tentacles. He talked about what they're doing in medicine. You know, they bought a company called One Medical. I think any company that wants to try and transform medicine in the United States deserves our support.\n\nLev-Ram: Good luck to them.\n\nMurray: It's a massive company that touches our lives in so many ways, which is why this interview was so much fun. I'm really, really sorry you weren't there, Michal. But let's dive in and remind everyone that this is in a tight room in a tiny little ski village in the Swiss Alps with about 80 CEOs of big global companies. So it's a different context than our normal Leadership Next.\n\n[Music.]\n\nAndy Jassy, why don't you come up here and join me? [Applause.] I think he needs no introduction. You guys have heard of Amazon. One-and-a-half million people, one-and-a-half trillion dollars in market cap. But I learned something really interesting tonight for the first time\u2014that you almost came to work for Fortune. You want to you want to share that story?\n\nAndy Jassy: Well, I had. First of all, it's great to be here with all of you. I was telling Alan that I thought you were going to talk about the beef tournedos. I was hoping\u2026\n\nMurray: We will get to that.\n\nJassy: In between my first job and going to graduate school, when I was applying, I had this recruiter call me about Fortune magazine, and I had a lot of friends I'd worked with before who were there. I had a lot of respect for Time Inc. I got the offer, and I almost did the job instead of going to business school, and then I decided to go to graduate school.\n\nMurray: It's like Fortune, Amazon, Fortune, Amazon.\n\nJassy: It was business school.\n\nMurray: You made a good decision.\n\nJassy: It was just luck. Total luck.\n\nMurray: You got it right. I want to start by asking you the question that everybody in this room is going to be asked to address tonight, because this is where we really get value out of this dinner. Look at the year ahead. What do you see as the single biggest opportunity facing business and the single biggest risk facing business?\n\nJassy: Well, of course, everything we think we know today may be different three months from now. So take this with a grain of salt. I would say that to me, I think the opportunity and risk is pretty similar in that there is this wildly transformative, disruptive technology in generative AI, that you can't get through any conversation without talking about. And I think people, as they, you know, people were on this march pre-pandemic to modernize their technology. You know, it's just part of, you know, I used to manage this business, this AWS business, our cloud computing business. And people were on this march to modernize their technology, to be able to have a lower cost structure, and have better developer productivity, and innovate at a faster clip. And then the pandemic happened. And then we had this economy where everyone, you know, most enterprises tried to figure out how they could save money in any way they could, ours included. And a lot of the low-hanging fruit and cost optimization has attenuated over the last several months, and we're back to starting to invest. I just see companies really battling with the prioritization between are they better off continuing with that modernization of their technology platform or should they spend all their new engineering resources on generative AI?\n\nIn my opinion, you have to think, again, it's prioritization. Everyone will decide differently. I think you have to think about it in a balanced way because, to me, if you don't set, basically, if you don't have your technology infrastructure foundation right, you are going to have a hard time being successful with generative AI. And actually it's such a sure win to be able to modernize your technology and move to the cloud that, to me, it has a very predictable payback. And yet at the same time, I think you would be foolish not to figure out how to use generative AI successfully. I think everyone is trying to figure out how to be successful in a cost effective and higher ROI way. And so I think that, to me, a lot of companies will end up deciding to take the sure successful win of modernizing their technology platform and setting their foundation right, and then picking at least one or two generative AI initiatives where they can learn how to run it. They can learn how to be successful, they can figure out what you got to do to get the right ROI and right customer experience for your business. But it's got to be a balance, in my opinion.\n\nMurray: Do you think Davos has overdone the AI thing a bit?\n\nJassy: I mean, I don't think Davos is unique to that. Yeah, I think it is so exciting. It's really, it has the chance to transform virtually every customer experience. I mean, we're building 60-ish applications right now.\n\nMurray: Yeah, yeah. Let me ask you about that because, yes, every conversation for the last four days has been about AI and particularly generative AI. But when you talk to people about it, they generally talk about Open AI and Microsoft. Maybe they talk about Google, maybe they bring in Meta, but they don't talk about Amazon. I mean, do you feel like you have missed, been behind the braid a little bit on this or what? Why are we not hearing Amazon in the same sense?\n\nJassy: I don't. Know who you're talking to Alan. [Laughter from crowd.] Not our customers.\n\nBut, you know, I think that most of the conversation, in my opinion, on generative AI so far has really been at the application layer. So, things like ChatGPT, which is by the way, a really remarkable application. But the way that we think about AI is it has three layers of the stack, and all three are massive, and we're investing very heavily in all three. But you know, at the bottom layer, if you're going to build your own large language models, you're going to have to train the models. And the key to training is compute, and the key to compute is the chip in the compute, and today there's really been one GPU chip provider, and many of you probably know it's hard to get capacity right now. And people are wondering, you know, what the cost structure is really going to be like.\n\nAnd so, you know, about five years ago we invested in building our own custom AI chips, and we have a chip that we've built for training called Training, and one that we built for inference called Inferential. And we're on the second version of those chips, and they're going to be meaningfully more price performant than what you see elsewhere. And so, you know, when you get into, I think customers who build models are starting to figure out the cost equation is maybe a little bit different than they thought. And then the dirty little secret\u2014if you have generative AI apps in production at scale like we do in a bunch of areas like Alexa\u2014is that almost all the cost ends up being in the inference. You know, you train, take Alexa, you train periodically, but we have billions of predictions or inferences coming, you know, every day. And so people are going to really care about that price performance. So that bottom layer is an area I think people are going to care about.\n\nAnd then at that middle layer, it's really for companies that don't want to build their own large language models. They want to use somebody else's and customize it with their own data. And, you know, we built a service called Bedrock there that does just that. It basically takes our own large language models, and then Anthropic\u2019s and Meta\u2019s with Llama 2 and Cohere and Stability AI. And you know, it takes whatever hard language models you think you want to use, you can customize it with your own data, not leak it back into the general model, and they have the same security and access control and features that you run in the platform. And that also, like, what you're learning, when you actually talk to companies or if you have your own experience building generative AI apps, you realize that it's not going to be one model to rule the world. It\u2019s going to be lots of different models that are better at different things. And then, you know, to try to get the quality that you need for your customers and your reputation at the cost structure and the latency you need for the customer experience, it's actually not simple. And so one of the attractive parts of something like Bedrock is you can move between models and between sizes and models to experiment and find the right experience.\n\nAnd, you know, and then there's that top layer which are the applications. And you know, there's, there's ChatGPT. But I think another really compelling application in the early days is the Coding Companion. And, you know, we launched a single months ago called Queue that writes code for you, it debugs the code and tests the code, it does transformations in both versions of Java to the new versions, and it looks at your data repositories and lets you answer questions. So all three layers of those stacks. Now that stack is important, and we're making big investments in all those areas, and I think it's still quite early days, but\u2026\n\nMurray: But you feel comfortable with where you are now?\n\nJassy: It is so early. This is like three steps into a marathon, but our customers really like what we're building.\n\nMurray: Well let me ask you, in my house and many of our houses, the first time we started talking to the furniture was Alexa, as you mentioned. So how does Alexa fit in to this process?\n\nJassy: Yeah, well, you know, Alexa, like a number of different areas inside our company, is one of the many businesses that is building a significant large language model. And, you know, Alexa as you know, you've used Alexa for lots of different things, but we're building a much more expansive, large language model that is aimed to fulfill our broader vision, which has always been the vision for Alexa, which is to be, you know, the world's best personal assistant.\n\n[Music starts.]\n\nMurray:  I\u2019m here with Jason Girzadas, the CEO of Deloitte U.S., the sponsor of this podcast. Thanks for sponsoring and thanks for joining me, Jason.\n\nJason Girzadas: It's a pleasure to be with you, Alan, and our privilege to sponsor this important podcast.\n\nMurray: It's great to have you. This whole notion of generative AI is really exploded onto the scene and into our consciousness in the last year. It's the fastest introduction of a new technology in history. How do business leaders deal with that and how do they separate the hype from the opportunity?\n\nGirzadas: It's a great question, Alan. The hype is real, but we also think the opportunity is more real and in fact an imperative for all businesses. The opportunity right now for businesses is around taking advantage of generative AI and other digital technologies for efficiency and productivity gains, with the belief they will continue to evolve and mature, such that there's other opportunities for value creation and that new disruptions and innovations that we haven't even seen the possibilities of. The challenge just to balance this opportunity. As a result, businesses have to diversify their approaches. It's a CEO level priority, but an understanding of where and how these models are being put to use in your business operations. What are the controls put around data and data quality, as well as ensuring that the models are tested and actually validated like you would do any other customer facing or highly sensitive system in an enterprise environment.\n\nMurray: Jason, thanks for your perspective and thanks for sponsoring Leadership Next.\n\nGirzadas: Thank you.\n\n[Music ends.]\n\nMurray: So, I want to talk to\u2026you've been in this job for two years now, right?\n\nJassy: Two and a half.\n\nMurray: Two and a half. Okay. So you've learned a lot. You've experienced a lot. How would you say your leadership style is different than your predecessor?\n\nYou can do this, Andy. Come on.\n\nJassy: Well, I mean, you know, it's a trick question, but then, you know, look, I grew up at Amazon. You know, I've been in Amazon for 26-and-a-half years, and I've done so many different jobs there, and I've been lucky enough to work closely with Jeff. I worked directly for Jeff for 20 years. So, you know, I feel like I learned from somebody who's arguably the most unusual business leader of our era. So, you know, I'm lucky that way. But I do think that every era of business leadership, I think everybody knows this in this room is different. When I started the job, nobody really predicted that the pandemic would last that long, and Omicron would come, and the war in Ukraine would come, and the inflation. I mean, you know, there's lots of things that happened throughout, and you have to just keep adjusting. And that's what we tried to do as a team.\n\nMurray: But when you now, you have two and a half years to look back, how is it different? Granted, anybody in the job would have changed. But how do you think the leadership at Amazon is different than it\u2026?\n\nJassy: Well, I don't, you know, we have a very, yeah, we have a set of leadership principles, there are 16 leadership principles that we, you know, carefully crafted and recrafted over the years. I think the leadership principles are quite consistent. I think the leaders are very consistent culturally. It's just we have different, we have some different folks leading the businesses at this point.\n\nMurray: Yeah, I could keep trying, but you probably don't want me to.\n\n[Laughter from audience.]\n\nJassy: You have to decide how long you want to go on.\n\n[More laughter.]\n\nMurray: Okay, let's see. Where can we go from there? One of the things that has come up in a number of conversations over the course of the last week is with everyone imagining these incredible options for using AI, there is a question about where does the compute power and where does the electricity come from to run all these massive applications? Amazon has been early and strong on sustainability, but how does this explosion in interest in complicated, massive compute power make you think about sustainability?\n\nJassy: Well, you know, I think we all I've been in the Fortune dinner business, maybe my third or fourth year, and we always talk about how important the environment is and how critical it is. And like a lot of you know, we have this thing called the Climate Pledge where we've, you know, pledged to be carbon zero by 2040. And for a company like ours, it's different than most technology companies. We're already well over 90% renewable energy now. We\u2019ll be 100% in 2025. But to get all the way there, when you have to ship as many products as we do with as many trucks and you know, the packaging and all the buildings, it's quite difficult.\n\nAnd I think it's interesting what's happened with power. I think that a lot of the municipalities around the world underestimated how much power was required. In fact, several of them told us they just took our estimates and cut them by a third. They just didn't believe them. And that was during the pandemic and that was before, you know, generative AI came about. You know, generative AI and these large language models are so power hungry that it's been an explosion in demand, and there's not enough energy right now. And so, we're going to have the dual challenge as a group to find a lot more energy to satisfy what people want to do and what we can get done for society with generative AI. But we've got to do it in a renewable way, in a carbon neutral or zero way. It can't be going back to coal. So that that will require a lot of development, and we\u2019ll have to be part of that.\n\nMurray: So what's the next big thing to come from Amazon? I mean, is it health? You made this investment in One Medical. What's the thing that excites you that could be a fourth pillar for Amazon?\n\nJassy: Well, there are so many things that I'm excited about. This is a hard, this is not a soup question. You know, I think that I'm very bullish on what we're doing with Prime Video. You know, I think the combination of the customer experience, the content we build ourselves, you know, the sports that we have and then all of our third-party media partners who are part of our channels program, we're trying to build the place as the best selection of streaming video. And I think that customers, you know, the growth that we've had there, the growth in engagement, the growth in customers, the marketplace, I\u2019m very bullish about that business and how it's progressing. I also think, you know, there's still 400 to 500 million households around the world that don't have broadband connectivity. And so they can't do the things we take for granted. They can't do education online. They can't do their jobs online. They can't watch entertainment, they can't buy. And so we're pursuing this Earth orbit satellite that we call Kuiper that we think will have a real meaningful impact on a lot of people around the world, particularly in rural areas that I also think will be\u2026 it's a big capital investment, but I think it will help a lot of people and it will be a good business as well.\n\nMurray: When will you start to roll that out?\n\nJassy: We'll start to roll it out this year. You know, we did our first two big end-to-end test satellites in October that really performed very well. So there's a lot of demand for that. There's demand on the government and the enterprise side, and consumers are excited about it too.\n\nMurray: Health care? There are a lot of people curious about where you're going in health care.\n\nJassy: You know, I feel like when my parents tell me that they didn't have color TV, you know, I just kind of roll my eyes. Like my kids, you know, roll their eyes when I said we didn't have the internet when I was growing up or mobile phones. But I think that my kids\u2019 kids will not believe what the health care experience was for us. Like the fact that if you want to go see a doctor, you got to make an appointment three or four weeks out, you got to drive 20 minutes and park. You have to wait in the waiting room for 15 minutes. Then they put you in an exam room. You go, wait 10 minutes for the doctor. Doctor sees you for 10 minutes and you drive 20 minutes to the pharmacy, I mean, that experience is just kind of nutty. And that that will completely go away with the way the future of health care is. And so One Medical is a different way of doing primary care. It has an amazing digital interface. You can chat with doctors, you can do video conferences, you can make appointments same day or next day. You can get into specialists same day or next day. All the reservations are integrated. And then if you whatever pharmaceutical needs you have, they're connected to Amazon Pharmacy and to a bunch of others that you just get sent to your house within a day. So it's a very different experience and, you know, pharmacy for us was not a big extension. We've been asked by customers for so long to do that, and that business has grown really quickly, and I think will be big as well. But we're really trying to get at changing the core health care experience, starting in the U.S., which I think has not been a happy place for a lot of people.\n\nMurray: We're just about out of time here. But you've got this massive antitrust case against you from the FTC. I mean, anything to that.\n\n[Jassy laughs.]\n\nI'm trying to make it easy for you.\n\nJassy: Well, what I would say to that is I am aware of it and\u2026\n\n[Laughter from crowd.]\n\nMurray: I\u2019ll ask you another question. Have you watched the video of Bill Gates being deposed in the 1990s in his antitrust case?\n\nJassy: No, I haven't.\n\nMurray: You haven't? You should.\n\nJassy: Okay.\n\nMurray: Yeah, I would strongly recommend you do.\n\nJassy: You know, I think all I can say about that is I think that I think they're wrong on the facts and the law. I think that will be borne out over time. How they go in general, we need to be careful in in Western countries not to kill innovation and not, you know, there's a lot of consolidate in various industries, and if we only, you know, have strong regulations in Western countries, you'll leave the playing field open in other spots you don't mean to.\n\nMurray: Is there anything that I haven't asked you that I should have?\n\nJassy: Not that I'm aware of.\n\nMurray: Good.\n\nJassy: If I knew what beef tournedos\u2026.\n\nMurray: You're going to find out in just a minute. Go ahead. Take your seat. Thank you for doing this.

But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all.\n\nThat's because, these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss.\n\nHowever, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.\n\nOur proprietary system currently recommends Amazon (AMZN) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\n\nStudies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).\n\nHere are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this online retailer a great growth pick right now.\n\nEarnings Growth\n\nArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\n\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Amazon is 7.4%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 35.6% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 27.5%.\n\nImpressive Asset Utilization Ratio\n\nGrowth investors often overlook asset utilization ratio, also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio, but it is an important feature of a real growth stock. This metric exhibits how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nRight now, Amazon has an S/TA ratio of 1.17, which means that the company gets $1.17 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.8, it can be said that the company is more efficient.\n\nIn addition to efficiency in generating sales, sales growth plays an important role. And Amazon is well positioned from a sales growth perspective too. The company's sales are expected to grow 11.5% this year versus the industry average of 9.7%.\n\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nThere have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Amazon. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 1.7% over the past month.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAmazon has not only earned a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nThis combination indicates that Amazon is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

We\u2019re going to get earnings reports from these companies as well.\n\nCan They Beat Again?\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to have a perfect earnings surprise track record.

For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Hedge Fund Manager Charles Paquelet\u2019s Top 5 Tech Stock Picks.\n\nCharles Paquelet is an American hedge fund manager who founded Skylands Capital in 2004. Paquelet came to limelight during his tenure at Strong Capital Management, Inc. which he joined in 1989. Paquelet has a Bachelor of Science degree from Case Western Reserve University's Weatherhead School of Business and also has a Master of Business Administration program with a specialization in finance. In August 1996, Charles Paquelet was named co-manager of the fund Strong Discovery. The Strong fund was going through losses when Paquelet was tasked with this responsibility. A few months earlier the fund had started cutting its exposure to US stocks based on its bearish outlook for the economy. But when its thesis proved wrong, the fund scrambled to buy small-cap stocks, which later plunged, leaving the fund's returns deeply in the red. A 1997 report by the New York Times talked in detail about the Strong fund's strategy to mitigate losses and the arrival of Paquelet at the helm. The report gives some idea of Paquelet's strategy at that time to make a comeback:\n\n''Our investment approach is built on kicking tires and building relationships with management,\" Paquelet said according to the NYTimes report.\n\nIn 2000, Richard Strong, the founder of Strong Capital Management, started giving up control of the fund to Charles Paquelet. In 2004, Strong Financial Corp. sold one of its portfolios to Charles Paquelet who established a new investment firm called Skylands Capital. The fund had $661 million under managed securities as of the end of the third quarter of 2023. You will see some of the top names like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Visa Inc (NYSE:V) in the fund's portfolio as well as spot under-the-radar small-cap names which could explode in the future.\n\nStory continues\n\nCharles Paquelet's Investment Philosophy\n\nSkylands Capital's investing philosophy revolves around the idea of economic cycles. The fund believes the human mind thinks linearly and has a tendency to \"extrapolate\" recent trends, while economies, markets and companies usually go through cycles which are defined by interest rates, commodity prices, regulatory changes, taxes, competitive behavior and many other factors. Skylands Capital believes this disparity between the reality of financial markets and the thinking process of the human mind could create long-term investing opportunities for investors who \"can anticipate change before it is obvious.\"\n\nValue or Growth?\n\nCharles Paquelet does not believe in adhering just to value or growth. Instead his fund looks to invest in growing companies trading at attractive valuations.\n\n\"It is a false choice to invest in either growth or value. The optimal investment is a structurally advantaged growing business that can be purchased at a value price. There are two sides to investing - what you get and what you pay. Both are important,\" the fund's website says.

(NASDAQ:IRDM) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cIridium Communications Inc. (NASDAQ:IRDM) is a leading mobile voice and data communications services vendor offering global coverage via satellite. Shares fell on second quarter earnings, growth modestly slower than expected. Investors were also concerned by a potential slowdown in Iridium\u2019s voice and data segment following several years during which the segment benefited from price increases and competition displacements. We attribute the earnings miss to a one-time write off of a spare satellite. This will not impact the company\u2019s long-term prospects. We also remain excited about the potential benefit from Iridium\u2019s recent partnership with Qualcomm to allow satellite connectivity on its new Snapdragon chips. While Iridium has suggested the realization of the direct-to-device opportunity might take longer than some investors had hoped, we believe the collaboration will yield substantial revenue for the company over time. We also remain excited about the company\u2019s capital allocation program, which should benefit shareholders in the years ahead.\u201d\n\n7. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nSkylands Capital's Stake Value: $2,612,316\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the top tech stock picks of hedge fund manager Charles Paquelet since his hedge fund Skylands Capital has a $2.6 million stake in the ecommerce retailer which is also a part of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks that have gained a lot amid the AI boom.\n\nUBS recently published a list of quality stocks it believes could outperform in 2024. Amazon.com Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMZN)\u00a0was part of the list. UBS said in its note that these Buy-rated stocks are in\u00a0\"30% top for quality, have positive earnings momentum, are not crowded -- have a crowding data score better than 0.1 -- and have reasonable value without overly high beta.\"\n\nAmazon.com Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMZN)\u00a0is also among the most popular technology stocks among the elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey. As of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 286 hedge funds had stakes in Amazon.com Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cFor the full year, the top relative and absolute contributors were\u00a0Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Salesforce, and ServiceNow. Amazon shares appreciated 88% in 2023, driven primarily by rapidly expanding operating profit margins and free cash flow growth. After the pandemic, Amazon experienced a period of inefficiency and overinvestment in its distribution and logistics infrastructure. Amazon is now leveraging these investments as growth returned to its e-commerce business in 2023 after a highly unusual 2022. At the same time, Amazon\u2019s rapidly growing and high-margin advertising business is contributing strongly to the entire company\u2019s operating profit growth. The AWS (Amazon Web Services) cloud infrastructure and services business continued to slow in 2023 as customers anticipating a more difficult economic environment looked to save money on their cloud spend, but these cloud spending optimizations began to stabilize in the second half of 2023. We now expect customer interest in generative AI will begin to contribute to growth.\u201d\n\n6.

(NASDAQ:SSNC) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cOur bottom contributors in Q3 were all from our long book, including HCA Healthcare and\u00a0SS&C Technologies Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:SSNC). SS&C Technologies, a provider of software and services to investment firms, brokerages and other financial institutions, has faced slower organic growth in recent quarters as its business units have produced inconsistent results. Further, rising costs have crimped margins \u2014 issues we believe will eventually stabilize but which we are monitoring closely. However, we believe the market is overly pessimistic about the company\u2019s ability to improve its organic growth rate and its margins and are maintaining our position.\u201d\n\nClick to continue reading and seeHedge Fund Manager Charles Paquelet\u2019s Top 5 Tech Stock Picks.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n10 Best Tech Stocks for the Next 5 Years 10 Best Long-Term Tech Stocks To Buy 17 High Growth Non-Tech Stocks That Are Profitable\n\nDisclosure.

For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer is Bullish on These 5 Stocks.\n\nThese days, Jim Cramer is continuously talking about the broader market rotation out of AI and mega-cap tech towards stocks with lower valuation multiples. In his latest program, Cramer said that stocks from bank, steel and auto sectors are getting a lot of attention from the Wall Street. Cramer said in this environment he would buy stocks like General Motors that is trading four times earnings. Cramer said \"to raise the money\" to invest in undervalued stocks like GM, \"I will sell shares that trade 40 times earnings.\"\n\n\"Charnel House\" of Tech Stocks?\n\nCramer said that the money going into undervalued stocks cannot be \"enticed\" into \"what looks like a charnel house\" of tech stocks. Cramer also mentioned Wells Fargo and said investors in this environment would prefer to buy Wells Fargo which trades at lower multiples and also offers dividends instead of buying software stocks with higher earnings multiples or no earnings at all.\n\nJim Cramer also said that looking at some technical charts shows him that tech stocks are headed for major \"reversals.\"\n\nJim Cramer advised investors to practice patience in this environment and said it would be wise to process all the information as it comes before making any decisions.\n\nDespite constantly talking about this market rotation, Cramer also talks about how he's not worried about the lack of market breadth and concentration of market returns in tech stocks like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA). He recently said that his Charitable Trust owns the \"super six\" stocks (all Mag. 7 stocks minus Tesla) and there's a reason why all market gains were coming from tech stocks. Cramer said major tech companies make products and services for the Enterprise which has \"a lot of money\" to spend.\n\nStory continues Jim Cramer is Bullish on These Stocks\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article, we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer on CNBC and picked 10 stocks Cramer is bullish on and recommended investors to buy.

It is all over the place.\"\n\nGetty Images talked about how it's using generative AI in its business during its Q3 earnings call:\n\n\"In partnership with NVIDIA, we launched our generative AI service at the end of the quarter. The service is truly unique and addresses fundamental customer needs. Our model is trained solely with Getty Images\u2019 best-in-class content, addressing the legal risk that is pervasive in many other models that are trained with third-party intellectual property scraped from the web. We also believe this equates to higher quality outputs as a cake is only as good as its ingredients. With generative AI by Getty Images, users can be confident that the content they generate is safe to use in commercial settings and will not include any trademark brands, products, characters, or identifiable people.\n\nIt also does not produce deep takes or emulate the style of specific orders, which we believe is valued by our editorial and creative customers respectively.

PACCAR full year truck parts and other gross margins were 19.3% and were 19.4% in the fourth quarter, reflecting strong truck deliveries and excellent parts business. We estimate PACCAR\u2019s worldwide first quarter truck and parts gross margins to remain strong and be in the range of 18.5% to 19%. 2023 was another great year for PACCAR with many highlights, including revenue and net income records.\n\nPACCAR announced a joint venture to manufacture commercial vehicle batteries. DAF opened a new electric truck assembly plant and earned the Green Truck award as the most fuel-efficient truck in Europe.\"\n\nRead the full earnings call transcript here.\n\n6. Constellation Energy Corp (NASDAQ:CEG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 45\n\nJim Cramer was recently asked about his thoughts on Constellation Energy Corp (NASDAQ:CEG). An energetic Cramer said \"we like those guys so much.\" Cramer added that Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG) offers \"all the kind of energy I like\" under one roof.\n\nConstellation Energy Corp (NASDAQ:CEG) shares have gained about 46% over the past one year.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 45 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Constellation Energy Corp (NASDAQ:CEG).\n\nIn addition to Constellation Energy, Jim Cramer also likes Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nSound Shore Management made the following comment about Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cOn the plus side of the ledger, we had strong contributions from independent power producers Vistra and\u00a0Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG). Both stocks surged with higher US electricity prices as strong summer demand exposed reliability issues in many regions of the nation\u2019s electric grid. Meanwhile, Midwest focused Constellation is the biggest producer of carbon-free electricity in the US with nuclear power plants representing the majority of its capacity. We added the name in January 2023 when the stock was trading at a below normal 15 times earnings. Our research identified an upside to earnings power from maturing hedges and regulatory changes, including the Inflation Reduction Act\u2019s nuclear credit. A recent spinout from Exelon Corp, we viewed the strength of Constellation\u2019s clean, reliable baseload power model as an appealing and high potential offering for residential and commercial customers. The company\u2019s recent contract to supply Microsoft at premium power prices is evidence of the opportunity. Constellation is yet another example of an industry undergoing tremendous change that can offer attractive investment opportunities for investors with patience and a research process to uncover specific companies that are well positioned.\u201d\n\nClick to continue reading and see the Jim Cramer is Bullish on These 5 Stocks.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nJim Cramer Recommended Selling These 12 Stocks Jim Cramer Stock Portfolio: 12 Recent Additions Jim Cramer Says Recession Is Not Coming and Recommends These 11 Stocks\n\nDisclosure.

Some of them reduced their price targets on the stock while also publishing \u201cbuy\u201d or \u201chold\u201d-equivalent ratings on Rivian shares. So, we\u2019ll just have to conduct our own RIVN stock analysis. In the end, I think you\u2019ll find that it\u2019s a great time to invest in Rivian.\n\nThis year should be an exciting one for Rivian Automotive\u00a0and its stakeholders. Currently, Rivian is getting ready to build its second EV manufacturing plant\u00a0in Georgia. Yet, apparently some investors and analysts see little upside potential for Rivian stock. Maybe they\u2019re wrong, and maybe there\u2019s an opportunity here.\n\nRIVN Stock: Weighing the Concerns and Opportunities\n\nLet\u2019s start off with the elephant in the room: Ford (NYSE:F) reduced the production pace of its F-150 Lightning EV model and will transition around 1,400 workers because of weak EV demand.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nKnowing this, RIVN stock\u00a0investors might worry about weak demand for Rivian\u2019s R1T truck model. However, there aren\u2019t any company-specific press releases indicating soft demand for the R1T.\n\nAt this point, investors should wait for more data from Rivian Automotive\u00a0instead of jumping to conclusions. Maybe the \u201cEV winter\u201d will end soon and won\u2019t be as bad as the panic-sellers think it is.\n\nI seriously doubt that giant companies like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and AT&T (NYSE:T) would forge fleet-electrification deals with Rivian Automotive\u00a0if they didn\u2019t have conviction in Rivian. With RIVN stock recently falling to the $15 area, it feels like the market is simply ignoring Rivian Automotive\u2019s growth opportunities.\n\nAnalysts Drop Their Rivian Stock Price Targets\n\nIt\u2019s an interesting phenomenon when analysts lower their price targets on a stock but still issue \u201cbuy\u201d or \u201chold\u201d-equivalent ratings on that same stock. Here are some examples for Rivian stock:\n\nStory continues\n\nBarclays analyst Dan Levy: \u201cOverweight\u201d rating but price target lowered from $27 to $25. \u201cWe believe the company\u2019s leading EV portfolio and path of improvement make it a structural winner,\u201d Levy remarked. Needham analyst Chris Pierce: \u201cBuy\u201d rating but price target reduced from $25 to $22. According to TheFly, the Needham analysts feel that \u201cused vehicle pricing data and vehicle inventories\u201d support their \u201cconfidence in Rivian end demand.\u201d Deutsche Bank analyst\u00a0Emmanuel Rosner: \u201cHold\u201d rating and price target cut from $29 to $19. Goldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney: \u201cNeutral\u201d rating and price target lowered from $20 to $17.\n\nIt\u2019s unlikely that these analysts would recommend buy or holding a stock if they hated it. Without a doubt, the analysts have to weigh Rivian Automotive\u2019s challenges, such as the low-demand \u201cEV winter,\u201d against the company\u2019s opportunities, such as Rivian\u2019s upcoming R2 vehicle model production.\n\nHere\u2019s the kicker, though. If you see RIVN stock at $15 or $16, this it\u2019s below all of the aforementioned price targets. To me, this suggests that the market has already priced in all of Rivian Automotive\u2019s challenges and worst-case scenarios. Again, there\u2019s a sense that investors are completely overlooking Rivian\u2019s opportunities to grow and recover in 2024.\n\nRivian Stock Analysis: Buy Low, Don\u2019t Sell High\n\nPeople say that they like to \u201cbuy low and sell high.\u201d So, here we are and our RIVN stock analysis reveals a \u201cbuy low\u201d scenario that you can take advantage of right now. The Rivian Automotive\u00a0is already below Wall Street\u2019s forecasts, and the market is evidently baking worst-case scenarios in the pie.\n\nSo, if you\u2019re serious about \u201cbuy low, sell high,\u201d then take a look at Rivian stock today. Better yet, grab a handful of Rivian shares while they\u2019re still cheap. And don\u2019t worry about the \u201csell high\u201d part, as you may decide to put this stock in the \u201chold forever\u201d category at some point.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

(NASDAQ:AMZN)", "content": "Key Insights\n\nThe projected fair value for Amazon.com is US$197 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity With US$159 share price, Amazon.com appears to be trading close to its estimated fair value Analyst price target for AMZN is US$184 which is 6.7% below our fair value estimate\n\nToday we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) as an investment opportunity by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.\n\nRemember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Amazon.com\n\nStep By Step Through The Calculation\n\nWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nGenerally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:\n\nStory continues\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast\n\n2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$57.7b US$75.7b US$84.7b US$90.2b US$107.7b US$117.0b US$124.8b US$131.5b US$137.3b US$142.4b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x13 Analyst x10 Analyst x3 Analyst x4 Analyst x4 Est @ 8.61% Est @ 6.69% Est @ 5.35% Est @ 4.41% Est @ 3.75% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.5%  US$53.7k US$65.5k US$68.2k US$67.6k US$75.1k US$75.8k US$75.3k US$73.8k US$71.7k US$69.2k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$696b\n\nThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.5%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$142b\u00d7 (1 + 2.2%) \u00f7 (7.5%\u2013 2.2%) = US$2.8t\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$2.8t\u00f7 ( 1 + 7.5%)10= US$1.3t\n\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$2.0t. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$159, the company appears about fair value at a 19% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind. dcf\n\nImportant Assumptions\n\nWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Amazon.com as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.054. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for Amazon.com\n\nStrength\n\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.\n\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\n\nWeakness\n\nNo major weaknesses identified for AMZN.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.\n\nCurrent share price is below our estimate of fair value.\n\nThreat\n\nRevenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.\n\nMoving On:\n\nAlthough the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

Some say that investors shouldn't marry their stocks. I'd argue in favor of holding stocks for as long as their underlying businesses perform, which could include forever.\n\nAdmittedly, that sets the bar high. Most companies have occasional bumps and bruises. The good ones bounce back. But business is competitive, and staying atop the mountain for decades is hard.\n\nKeeping that in mind, I set out to build a list of artificial intelligence (AI) stocks that could potentially earn a permanent spot in a diversified portfolio. After all, AI is forecast to create trillions of dollars in economic value over the coming decades. That means it should be an excellent spot for long-term thinking.\n\nWhat makes a company (and its stock) likely to last for such a long time? Image source: Getty Images\n\nThe recipe for forever AI stocks\n\nNobody knows what the future will hold. AI could look completely different in a decade than it does now. Looking for future-resistant businesses steered me to look for a few crucial traits. Specifically, investors should take a closer look at companies with:\n\nDominant existing business models Great balance sheets Tremendous cash flows\n\nIn other words, look for situations where AI strengthens an already great company.\n\nWith that said, consider buying and keeping these three AI stocks forever:\n\n1. Nvidia: Dominating the AI chip market\n\nYou've probably seen a ton of coverage on Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and most investors already know about its potential. But Nvidia is too important to leave off this list just because it isn't the new thing. The company rapidly acquired a stranglehold on the AI chip market, and it is arguably the most essential building block of AI because the models that are essential to AI require lots of computing power to crunch data. According to analysts, Nvidia's AI chip market share sits around 90%.\n\nAs a result, business is booming. Top and bottom-line growth rocketed off in 2023, and since the AI chip market is poised to expand tremendously moving forward, this could be the new normal for a while.\n\nStory continues NVDA Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nWhy should investors feel optimistic that Nvidia will keep its market share? The company built an end-to-end hardware and software ecosystem that helps customers using its chips deploy and maximize their AI models. The entire platform is the secret sauce, not just the chips themselves. Are companies building within this ecosystem going to bail and use something else easily? That would be like changing all the electrical wiring in your house. It's a messy job that's probably not appealing to most.\n\n2. A cloud giant distributing AI tools\n\nE-commerce giant and cloud leader Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is known for several businesses, so its AI potential might slip under the radar a bit. But that could work in investors' favor. Amazon has already built a trillion-dollar company on e-commerce, cloud, advertising, and streaming. Its cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), has blossomed into the world's leader with an estimated 50% market share, according to research by HG Insights.\n\nThat same report estimates roughly 2.38 million businesses use Amazon's cloud computing services, so that is low-hanging fruit to begin cross-selling AI products and services. Cloud computing is already projected to continue growing for years, and weaving AI and machine learning into that business may only pour gas on Amazon's success. AMZN Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nAdditionally, Amazon's strong presence in e-commerce (38% market share in the U.S.) and rapidly growing advertising business are excellent safety nets for investors. AI can add to a winning business instead of putting Amazon in a make-or-break scenario. That sets a high floor, making Amazon an outstanding stock to buy and tuck away.\n\n3. Ambitious and bold leadership drives this stock\n\nCEO and entrepreneur Elon Musk seemingly likes doing hard stuff. He built a space exploration company and led Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) to disrupt the automotive industry with electric vehicles. Naturally, he wouldn't let the AI technology era arrive without tossing his hat in the ring. Tesla is investing heavily in multiple AI-related products.\n\nTesla's full-self-driving (FSD) ambitions headline this list. The company has been developing FSD software for years that relies on camera imagery to process the vehicle's surroundings. Musk himself has said that Tesla's value depends heavily on succeeding with FSD. Additionally, the company is developing a humanoid robot that will hopefully utilize FSD's tech to perform manual labor someday. Tesla's Dojo supercomputer powers its AI, making the EV company a full-fledged technology powerhouse. TSLA Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nFSD and robotics look promising, but ambition doesn't promise success. However, despite Musk's claim, Tesla likely has a bright future, supported by strong leadership in EVs and a growing energy business. Investors can buy into Tesla on that alone, with FSD and AI robotics being potential catalysts for Tesla to realize its full long-term investment potential.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

The company reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.93 on revenue of $62 billion, beating expectations of adjusted EPS of $2.78 on revenue of $61.1 billion.\n\nThe beats, however, failed to completely satisfy investors, as the stock moved about 1% lower in premarket rading Wednesday.\n\nMicrosoft's all-important cloud revenue topped out at $33.7 billion, beating estimates of $32.2 billion. The company's Intelligent Cloud business, which includes its Azure service, came in at $25.8 billion versus expectations of $25.3 billion. According to the company, AI services contributed 6 percentage points of growth to Azure revenue, increasing from 3 percentage points last quarter.\n\n\"We\u2019ve moved from talking about AI to applying AI at scale,\" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in a statement. \"By infusing AI across every layer of our tech stack, we\u2019re winning new customers and helping drive new benefits and productivity gains across every sector.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI trade, sending shares jumping 50% over the last 12 months and Microsoft\u2019s market capitalization over $3 trillion.\n\nAs of Tuesday afternoon, Microsoft was the wealthiest company in the world by market cap, outmuscling longtime rival Apple (AAPL), which has been stung by recent stock downgrades on fears of sluggish iPhone sales in China.\n\nOn the productivity side of things, Microsoft\u2019s Productivity and Business Processes revenue hit $19.25 billion, just ahead of estimates of $19.03 billion. The company\u2019s More Personal Computing business, which includes sales of its Windows software and Xbox gaming division, generated $16.89 billion.

(Ethan Miller/Getty Images) (Ethan Miller via Getty Images)\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s AI efforts permeate nearly every part of its business, and ensuring that pays off is something the company is heavily focused on. So far, it has monetized its AI efforts via generative AI cloud services, its Copilot for Microsoft 365 productivity platform, and its Copilot Pro for consumers.\n\nStory continues\n\nEarlier this month, the company also opened up its Copilot for Microsoft 365 to all businesses, eliminating a prior requirement that customers needed to have 300 employees or more to sign up for the paid service. Clients pay $30 per user per month for access to the software. Copilot Pro for consumers, meanwhile, costs $20 per month per user, and is meant for consumer customers who want to take advantage of Copilot\u2019s more advanced features.\n\nMicrosoft, as well as rivals Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN), have been pouring billions of dollars into AI investments over the last year as they each seek to gain the upper hand in the race to be the AI software leader.\n\nMicrosoft grabbed an early lead thanks to its investment in ChatGPT developer OpenAI, but Google and Amazon are gaining ground. Google released its powerful Gemini AI model in December, and, in September, Amazon announced a $4 billion investment in AI company Anthropic giving the cloud giant a minority ownership position in the firm.\n\nBut generative AI technology has come under fire recently, as users on X posted AI-generated explicit images of Taylor Swift. The move has prompted more calls for legislation targeting so-called deepfake images and videos. Sign up for the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nStill, it\u2019s unlikely the controversy will slow the AI train. With companies pumping out product announcements related to the technology at a steady pace, and PC and smartphone vendors debuting their own products capable of running generative AI software natively, it\u2019s clear generative AI will be a force throughout 2024.\n\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

Here's Which 1 Could Soar the Most in 2024.", "content": "You won't find many of the hottest growth stocks on the market in Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway portfolio. His approach focuses more on stocks with attractive valuations and underlying business models that are in his circle of competence.\n\nHowever, I didn't say you won't find any of these sizzling stocks among the legendary investor's holdings. Buffett has $177 billion invested in these \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks.\n\nBuffett's \"Magnificent Two\"\n\nThe Magnificent Seven narrows down to the \"Magnificent Two\" as far as Buffett is concerned. It's also probably fair to say that he views one of those two stocks as much more magnificent than the other.\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) ranks as the biggest position in Berkshire's portfolio by far. The conglomerate's stake is currently worth close to $175.9 billion.\n\nOne of Berkshire's other investment managers first bought 10 million shares of Apple in May 2016. However, it didn't take long for Buffett to jump aboard the Apple train. Buying the stock turned out to be a very good move. Apple's shares have soared more than 8x since Berkshire first purchased the stock, including a gain of more than 30% over the last 12 months.\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) stands as the only other Magnificent Seven stock in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. As was the case with Apple, another Berkshire investment manager initiated the position in Amazon. Buffett acknowledged shortly after the purchase of Amazon stock in 2019 that he had \"been an idiot for not buying\" sooner. Berkshire's stake in the e-commerce and cloud services giant is currently worth around $1.6 billion.\n\nEven though Buffett was late to the party with Amazon, he's had plenty to celebrate. Over the last 12 months alone, the stock has skyrocketed nearly 60%.\n\nWhich stock could soar the most in 2024?\n\nA greater percentage of analysts have bullish takes on Amazon than do Apple. I don't always agree with the prevailing view on Wall Street, but in this case, I think that the analysts are probably right.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple is a wonderful business. The stickiness of its iPhone ecosystem is truly impressive. However, investors should reasonably expect strong growth from a stock that trades at a forward earnings multiple of 29x. They're not getting it with Apple right now.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon continues to deliver tremendous earnings growth. The company's streamlining efforts are paying off. I predict that we'll see more evidence of this in the coming quarters as Amazon's profitability and free cash flow increase further.\n\nAmazon also has a clear catalyst both over the near term and the long term. The rising adoption of artificial intelligence (AI), in particular, generative AI, should spur more organizations to shift their IT spending to the cloud. As the leader in the cloud services market, Amazon Web Services stands to be a key beneficiary of this trend.\n\nThe U.S. economy appears to be demonstrating more resilience than many expected as well. That bodes well for Amazon's e-commerce business in 2024.\n\nBuffett's secret Magnificent Seven stocks\n\nApple and Amazon are the only Magnificent Seven stocks you'll see listed in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. However, Buffett and Berkshire do own two other members of the group.\n\nBerkshire's subsidiary, New England Asset Management (NEAM), has a separate portfolio. Like Berkshire, NEAM has a stake in Apple. It also owns shares of Google parent Alphabet and Microsoft.\n\nCould either of these other Magnificent Seven stocks ever find their way into Berkshire's portfolio? I think it's possible. Buffett has expressed his admiration for Google and Microsoft in the past. The biggest obstacle, for now, is probably the valuations of the two stocks. It wouldn't be a shock, though, if Buffett (or one of his lieutenants) scooped up Alphabet and/or Microsoft in the future.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Amazon wasn't one of them.

To date, Washington's attempts to regulate the industry have proceeded slowly and on parallel tracks at the White House and Capitol Hill.\n\nAn executive order issued by President Biden last October directed AI developers and users to apply AI \"responsibly.\" Just this week, the administration announced new details there, including a new requirement for developers to disclose their safety test results to the government.\n\nOn Capitol Hill meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has overseen a series of roundtables \u2014 with figures like Elon Musk and others in attendance \u2014 to begin the process of drafting new laws around the topic. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY). REUTERS/Anna Rose Layden (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nHe will be tasked with merging together a group of bipartisan bills under consideration. That includes one from Democratic Senator Gary Peters, Republican Senators Mike Braun and James Lankford to make it mandatory for US government agencies to disclose when they use AI for human interactions and to set in place an appeals process to allow individuals to object to AI-generated decisions.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn another bill introduced in June, Democratic Senators Michael Bennet and Mark Warner joined Republican Senator Todd Young in proposing an office of global competition analysis that would be tasked with helping the US maintain global leadership in AI.\n\nDemocratic Senator Richard Blumenthal and Republican Senator Josh Hawley also announced their own framework on AI legislation. They proposed that the US establish an independent licensing and oversight organization, along with AI transparency requirements and legal liability for harms caused by the technology.\n\nThere\u2019s no guarantee that any of this new US legislation will come to pass.\n\n\"The US is very free market, and difficult to get bipartisan consensus on a federal level,\" Kristensen said.\n\n'Proactive rather than reactive'\n\nThe US, deliberately, hasn\u2019t gone the way of the EU, said Ryan Abbott, a technology-focused intellectual property attorney and medical doctor. America's comparatively more market-driven, \"less regulation is more\" philosophy, he said, could lead lawmakers to police AI using existing IP, copyright, and trademark laws.\n\n\"There's a whole other view of this, which is that you really don't need something comprehensive because, really, existing rules cover AI regulation,\" Abbot added.\n\nIntellectual property law governs patents, copyrights and trademarks. And tort law protects individuals from harmful products placed into the market.\n\nAbbot, however, recommended in testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee last June that lawmakers should at least consider amending intellectual property laws so that AI-generated inventions are clearly patentable.

(Photo by Nathan Howard/Getty Images) (Nathan Howard via Getty Images)\n\n\"The reason that I've been saying that before, about the whole AI safety in advance of sort of anything terrible happening, is that consequences of AI going wrong are severe. So we have to be proactive rather than reactive,\" Musk said last September.\n\nWhite House national economic advisor Lael Brainard and acting Labor Secretary Julie Su said in a op-ed piece published in Yahoo Finance Tuesday that the Labor Department is creating a set of principles for \"the responsible, worker-centric use of AI\" while the administration prepares \"detailed policy recommendations to protect and support workers against potential AI-related job displacement.\"\n\nA similar approach is unfolding in the United Kingdom. That nation\u2019s government is now advocating for companies to voluntarily comply with key principles that its lawmakers set out in a white paper published last year. The UK is expected, for now, to empower its regulators to apply existing law to AI, and base potential legislation depending on future levels of compliance.\n\nChina has adopted more politically focused AI laws. Those requirements target AI-generated news distribution, deep fakes, chat bots, and datasets. To date, they are much less comprehensive than the EU\u2019s AI Act.\n\nKristensen estimated that the EU's new AI Act is likely to take effect over the next six to 24 months, as members of the 27-nation bloc sign off on the final text.\n\nSome members, including the French government, have been rumored to be exploring whether to revise and push back on certain parts of the act.\n\nWhatever final regulations each government adopts, Abbott said, will play a big role in how AI is developed and used from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.\n\n\"There's sort of a perception that there's an AI arms race right now, internationally.\"\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

When I complained, I was sent a photo of the package on my front doorstep. This was in spite of the fact that I had requested it be left out of sight at the back. Moreover, the app had given me a delivery date for the following week, so there was no one at home to sign for it. Amazon repeatedly told me that I was not eligible for a refund under the A-to-Z guarantee because I\u2019d reported an \u201cunusually high number\u201d of missing orders. I\u2019ve only ever made two other claims, both for low-value items, over the course of 13 years and hundreds of orders. Amazon\u2019s customer services told me to submit an online appeal, which generated a message directing me to its help pages, which would tell me to contact customer service. I was told customer service had no way of contacting the appeals team. JH, Castlewellan, County Down\n\nThere are undoubtedly customers who abuse the system, but Amazon\u2019s claim that you\u2019ve made an \u201cunusually high number\u201d of claims seems to be a common response when refusing a refund for pricier orders.\n\nOther readers who declare an unblemished shopping record have been told the same thing and Amazon has apologised and refunded them when I have queried the claim.\n\nEssentially, Amazon has a legal responsibility to ensure that you get what you paid for. If it suspects foul play, it needs evidence. I have previously highlighted how customers whose high-end goods disappear have been sent on a wild goose chase via the police, who have no remit over missing deliveries. And how Amazon ignores customers whose items vanish after its delivery verification system is abused or fails.\n\nAmazon predictably told me that your refund claim should have been granted immediately. It said: \u201cCustomer satisfaction is our utmost priority, and we\u2019re sorry that customer experience did not meet the high standards we expect. We have apologised and they\u2019ve been refunded in full.\u201d\n\nHelpfully, it added that customers who had a problem with an order from a third-party seller should contact it about a refund under the A-to-Z guarantee.

Alibaba stock has declined almost 40% in the last 12 months, but new catalysts have emerged to drive the stock higher in 2024. Although regulatory risks need to be monitored carefully, I am bullish on Alibaba stock.\n\nSoftBank Finally Completes Divesting Alibaba\n\nSoftBank (OTC:SFTBF), the Japanese investment firm led by billionaire Masayoshi Son, was one of the first institutional investors to believe in Alibaba. The investment firm invested $20 million in Alibaba in 2000. In late 2021, SoftBank entered into a forward contract with its subsidiary Skybridge to divest its Alibaba stake. This contract allowed SoftBank to repurchase Alibaba shares from Skybridge if needed.\n\nOn January 25, SoftBank announced the settlement of these prepaid forward contracts with Skybridge, reportedly booking a profit of around $8.5 billion from its investment in Alibaba. The investment firm has decided not to purchase or sell any new Alibaba shares in the foreseeable future. The firm currently owns a minor stake in Alibaba of approximately 0.5%, in contrast to an ownership stake of 32% back in 2021.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, the massive selling pressure created by SoftBank over the last couple of years acted as a barrier for Alibaba stock to trend higher despite the company spending massive amounts on share buybacks. For reference, the company spent $10.2 billion on stock repurchases in the last 12 months.\n\nGoing forward, it seems reasonable to assume that buybacks will finally create a positive impact, assuming the company continues to perform well financially.\n\nThe Founder and President Are Betting on Alibaba\n\nOn January 23, SEC filings revealed that Alibaba founder Jack Ma and current Chairman Joe Tsai both purchased company shares, indicating their improving sentiment toward the company\u2019s prospects at a time when SoftBank is exiting its investment. Mr. Ma purchased Alibaba shares worth $50 million, while Mr. Tsai invested $151 million in the company through his family investment fund.\n\nStory continues\n\nFollowing these transactions, Jack Ma and Joe Tsai became the two largest shareholders of the company, ending SoftBank\u2019s reign that spanned several years. The founding members\u2019 return as largest shareholders is likely to boost investor sentiment in the coming months, which was evident from the initial market reaction on January 23, when Alibaba stock jumped more than 7% following the release of SEC filings highlighting these transactions.\n\nAlibaba Enjoys a Long Runway to Grow\n\nAlibaba\u2019s investment appeal stems from two factors: the long growth runway enjoyed by the company and its cheap valuation.\n\nAlibaba has emerged as a leader in the cloud computing space in China, which is a market that is expected to grow exponentially in the next few years, with companies of all scales and sizes moving to the cloud. According to Canalys data, Alibaba Cloud accounted for 34% of the cloud market in China at the end of Q1 2023, with Huawei Cloud in second place with a market share of 20%.\n\nAccording to Statista, revenue in the Chinese public cloud sector will grow at a CAGR of 18.7% through 2028, resulting in a market value of $137 billion at the end of the forecast period. The ongoing integration of AI capabilities in the cloud market will be one of the key growth drivers in the next five years.\n\nAlibaba enjoys quantifiable pricing power in this market segment, and the company has reported consistently higher renewal rates compared to many of its peers. These observations suggest that Alibaba is well-positioned to make the most of the expected growth in the cloud market.\n\nThe company is integrating AI into its digital retail technologies, including the development of unified core technology and solving language translation challenges. In the digital media entertainment segment, the company is using AI to create next-generation content and to achieve process-based digitalized film and TV show production capabilities.\n\nAlthough a full business separation may not be in the cards anymore, Alibaba continues to find ways to manage its business units independently, which should enable the company to unlock hidden value in the coming years. This will be another growth driver.\n\nAt a more granular level, the company has come up with ambitious visions for each of its key business segments. Examples include 1688 aiming to leverage products manufactured in China with business customers in mind, Xianyu seeking to become a lifestyle platform without limiting itself to secondhand goods, DingTalk aiming to become the best AI smart assistant system in China, Quark targeting students to sell its knowledge products, and Youku committing to prioritize self-produced content to compete in the video content niche.\n\nIs Alibaba Stock a Buy, According to Wall Street Analysts?\n\nBased on the ratings of 20 Wall Street analysts, BABA stock comes in as a Strong Buy. The average Alibaba stock price target is $118.20, which implies upside potential of 63.4% from the current market price.\n\nAlibaba is trading at a meaningful discount to its historical valuation multiples and also compared to its American counterparts. The company is valued at a forward P/E of 8.2 compared to its five-year average forward P/E of 18.15. To add more context, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is trading at a forward P/E of 59.4.\n\nAlibaba\u2019s cheap valuation has attracted many Wall Street bulls in recent months, but its stock has not performed up to expectations due to investor worries about Chinese regulators and other macroeconomic factors.\n\nThe Takeaway: Alibaba Stock Is Closer to Turning a Corner\n\nAlibaba has remained cheaply valued for about two years. Today, new catalysts have emerged to drive the stock higher in the form of SoftBank completing its planned divestment of Alibaba shares and the improving regulatory improvement. The company seems attractively valued for long-term-oriented investors at a time when tables are turning in favor of the company both from a regulatory and financial performance perspective.\n\nDisclosure", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alibaba-stock-nyse-baba-bullish-061825055.html", "symbols": ["2RR.F", "9984.TSE", "9988.HK", "AHLA.F", "AHLA.STU", "AHLA.XETRA", "AMZN.US", "BABA.BA", "BABA.US", "BABA34.SA", "BABAF.US", "BABAN.MX", "SFT.F", "SFT.MU", "SFTBF.US", "SFTBY.US", "SFTU.F", "SFTU.STU"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.999, "neg": 0.012, "neu": 0.84, "pos": 0.148}}, {"date": "2024-01-31T05:31:11+00:00", "title": "Fed decision ahead; Microsoft, Alphabet's AI costs - what's moving markets", "content": "Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures are mixed as investors await a major Federal Reserve interest rate decision and potential commentary on future borrowing costs from the central bank. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google-owner Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) warn that spending on developing their artificial intelligence capabilities will be higher this year, offsetting a strong set of quarterly earnings from the tech giants. Elsewhere, Elon Musk's massive Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) pay package worth nearly $56 billion is voided by a Delaware judge.\n\n1. Fed decision ahead\n\nThe Federal Reserve is widely tipped to keep interest rates steady following the central bank's latest two-day policy meeting on Wednesday, meaning any comments from officials around the path ahead for interest rates will be in sharp focus.\n\nBorrowing costs currently stand at a range of 5.25% to 5.50%, the highest in more than two decades, after the Fed embarked on an aggressive campaign of rate hikes aimed at cooling elevated U.S. inflation.\n\nRecent data has suggested that this tightening cycle may be having the desired effect. While price growth remains above the Fed's stated 2% target, it has continued to show signs of easing back down to this mark. Economic activity has also been resilient, a trend most recently evidenced by a stronger-than-projected advance reading of fourth-quarter U.S. gross domestic product last week.\n\nThe figures have bolstered hopes that the Fed may be able to defeat inflation without sparking a broader economic meltdown -- a scenario known as a \"soft landing.\"\n\nPolicymakers signaled in December that there could be as many as six rate reductions in 2024, fueling anticipation late last year that a twenty five basis point cut could come as early as March. Yet several Fed officials, wary of reigniting upward pressure on inflation, have since poured cold water on these expectations. Commentary today from the Fed -- and Chair Jerome Powell in particular -- could thus impact how markets see rates evolving in the coming months.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Futures mixed\n\nU.S. stock futures were trading on both sides of the flatline, as investors looked ahead to the Fed decision and gauged a fresh slate of major corporate earnings.\n\nBy 05:26 ET (10:26 GMT), the Dow futures contract had added 34 points or 0.1%, while S&P 500 futures had dipped by 27 points or 0.5% and Nasdaq 100 futures had shed 224 points or 1.3%.\n\nThe Fed could finally \"put a pin in the idea\" of an imminent rate cut on Wednesday, said Michael Hewson, Chief Market Analysts at CMC Markets (LON:CMCX), in a note. \"It would be surprising if the Fed were to signal a cut in rates in March although they might well open the door to one on [the second quarter],\" Hewson added.\n\nElsewhere, shares in Microsoft and Alphabet slipped in premarket trading, with Wall Street fretting over the large costs both of the tech behemoths are set to incur in their push to develop products powered by artificial intelligence (more below). More earnings are due out today, including numbers from embattled planemaker Boeing (NYSE:BA) and drugmaker Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO).\n\nIn the prior session, the benchmark S&P 500 closed lower by 0.1%, but was still just under its all-time high reached on Monday, while a dip in megacap names like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) dragged down the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite by 0.8%. The 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.4%.\n\n3. Microsoft, Alphabet flag AI costs\n\nMicrosoft and Google-owner Alphabet have flagged that they expect capital spending will rise this year as they attempt to bolster their position in the intensifying race to harness surging demand for generative AI.\n\nRedmond, Washington-based Microsoft told analysts in a post-earnings call that the need to scale its AI infrastructure would cause expenditures to \"increase materially\" on a sequential basis in areas like data centers and servers. Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood added that Microsoft, who surpassed Apple has the world's biggest company earlier this month, is shifting to an \"AI-first position.\"\n\nAlphabet also said that spending would be \"notably larger\" in 2024, with the YouTube-parent driving to build out its AI offerings at its key advertising and cloud services units. In particular, Alphabet is targeting the launch of an advanced upgrade to its generative AI chatbot, Bard, later this year.\n\nFinance chief Ruth Porat noted that the group sees \"extraordinary\" potential for the applications of AI for users, adding that the technology offers \"long-term growth opportunities.\"\n\nBoth firms posted better-than-anticipated profit and revenues in their most recent quarters, although Wall Street's tepid reaction indicated that doubts remain over whether they can maintain the soaring spending levels needed to deliver generative AI.\n\n\"In the larger picture, the trend for this earnings season is clear: the market wants to see who has enough spending power to dominate the innovation war expected to play out as soon as monetary conditions improve,\" said Thomas Monteiro, Senior Analyst at Investing.com. \"In this case, more than actual [earnings per share], investors want to see improving margins and free cash flows so they can understand that the company will have a shot in the AI arms race.\"\n\n4. Judge tosses out Musk's massive Tesla pay package\n\nA judge in the U.S. state of Delaware has voided tech tycoon's Elon Musk's huge $55.8 billion Tesla pay package, saying that it amounted to an \"unfathomable sum\" that was not fair to shareholders.\n\nThe decision, which tosses out the biggest remuneration offering in corporate America, argued that the directors of the electric vehicle giant appeared to be beholden to Musk's \"superstar appeal.\" The case related to a lawsuit brought by some Tesla stakeholders who believed that the compensation was excessive.\n\nShould the ruling be upheld, Musk would lose options to more than 303 million Tesla shares, or roughly about 10% of the company and well below his previously stated goal of 25% ownership.\n\nShares in Tesla slipped in premarket trading on Wednesday.\n\n5. Crude dips after weak Chinese manufacturing data\n\nOil prices edged lower, as disappointing manufacturing activity data from China, the world's biggest crude importer, dented sentiment.\n\nBy 05:27 ET, the U.S. crude futures traded 1.2% lower at $76.89 per barrel, while the Brent contract dropped 1.1% to $81.59 a barrel.\n\nOfficial data showed that manufacturing activity in China contracted for a fourth straight month in January, raising further doubts around the strength of the economic recovery of this vital crude market.\n\nThat said, the crude benchmarks are still on course for their first monthly gain since September as broadening Middle East conflicts exacerbated supply concerns over this oil-rich region.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. inventory data from the American Petroleum Institute indicated that crude stockpiles dropped by 2.5 million barrels in the week ended Jan. 26.\n\nUpgrade your investing with our groundbreaking, AI-powered InvestingPro+ stock picks.

You can skip our detailed analysis on companies that are taking measures to combat pollution and head over directly to the 10 Most Air Polluted Cities In The World.\n\nA report by the International Energy Agency (IEA) in March 2023 highlighted that global carbon emissions reached an all-time high of 36.8 Gt in 2022 \u2013 having increased 0.9% compared to the previous year. Vehicle emissions, smoke from manufacturing in factories, chemical production, coal power plants, and the use of natural gas to provide heating at homes are the primary sources of pollution and trigger global warming, according to the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.\n\nA study by Climate Central in September last year found that 98% of the world\u2019s population was exposed to global warming and experienced hotter temperatures between June and September 2023 due to carbon dioxide pollution.\n\nSeveral notable corporations have committed themselves to tackling air pollutants over the last few years. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) has been scaling investments in carbon removal technologies (CDR). In May last year, the company announced that it had signed two separate agreements worth over $200 million with Climeworks and CO280 Solutions, Inc. to purchase CDRs, which JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) expects to remove and store 800,000 metric tons of carbon from the atmosphere.\n\nThe investment is part of the company\u2019s sustainable development targets announced in 2021, which includes spending up to $2.5 trillion by 2030 to address climate change, and $1 trillion for green initiatives. These measures have received acclaim from JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM)\u2019s investors. ClearBridge Sustainability Leaders Strategy made the following comment in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\nIn addition to business models that support biodiversity, it is also important to provide financing for efforts to improve biodiversity. Large financial firms such as ClearBridge holding JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) have a key role here through green bond underwritings that support natural capital protection. In 2021 JPM announced a target to finance and facilitate $1 trillion toward green initiatives by 2030 as part of its broader $2.5 trillion sustainable development target. The green initiatives include biodiversity-linked areas such as water management, circular economy and waste management, in addition to conservation and biodiversity, which focuses on improving terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity ecosystems or forests.\n\nAs part of this target, in 2022 JPM served as the lead underwriter for a $350 million green bond issued by The Nature Conservancy, the largest green bond issuance by a conservation nonprofit ever. The issuance is expected to help The Nature Conservancy avoid or sequester 3 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e), and conserve 650 million hectares of healthy land, 30 million hectares of freshwater and 4 billion hectares of oceans.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has also announced investments in direct air capture (DAC) technology to clean the atmosphere from emissions. In September 2023, the company said it was going to purchase 250,000 tonnes of removal credits from 1PointFive over a period of 10 years, which is about the same amount of carbon that is stored across at least 290,000 acres of forest land across the United States. The move is part of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u2019s goal of net zero emissions by 2040. According to a report in Reuters, carbon removal credits per metric tonne can cost in the range of mid-to-high-triple digits.\n\nIn addition to this, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also making an investment in CarbonCapture, another prominent climate technology company that is known for its DAC systems. The financial aspects of the deal are not known. In return, CarbonCapture will be providing Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) 100,000 tonnes of removal credits, which the company plans on making available for its partner, customers, and suppliers as well along with its own business units.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) also announced in 2020 to purchase sustainable aviation fuel credits from SkyNRG and supply them to Alaska Airlines to operate flights between Seattle \u2013 15 miles from Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u2019s head office in Redmond \u2013 and San Francisco, Los Angeles, and San Jose. The reasoning behind the company\u2019s decision is the hope that this would help in reducing pollution caused by commercial flights taken by its employees. A year earlier, the company\u2019s fact sheet showed that travel made up 3% of all carbon emissions made by Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in 2019. 30 Most Air Polluted Cities In The World\n\nJorg Hackemann/Shutterstock.com\n\nMethodology\n\nThe 30 most air polluted cities in the world are ranked in ascending order of their Air Quality Index (AQI) scores based on live-time data being updated on IQAir. The list was created on January 29, 2024 at 20:00 GMT.\n\nAQI scores come in six categories \u2013 0-50 (Good), 51-100 (Moderate), 101-150 (Unhealthy for sensitive groups), 151-200 (Unhealthy), 201-300 (Very unhealthy), and 301+ (Hazardous).\n\nIf interested, you can also take a look at the 30 Most Air Polluted Countries in the World.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

Whether you are a beginner investor or professional one looking for the best stocks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\nLet\u2019s now head over to the list of the most polluted cities in the world for air quality.\n\n30. Incheon, South Korea\n\nAQI US: 117\n\nIncheon is one of the most polluted cities in the world in terms of air quality, with a PM2.5 concentration of 43 \u00b5g/m\u00b3 \u2013 8.6 times higher than WHO guidelines.\n\n29. Shenzhen, China\n\nAQI US: 117\n\nThe air quality in Shenzhen is unhealthy for sensitive groups, according to IQAir. Health experts advise people in the city to reduce outdoor activities or wear a mask when outside.\n\n28. Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR\n\nAQI US: 118\n\nHong Kong is among the most air polluted cities in the world, with a high concentration of air pollutants in the atmosphere. Its PM2.5 concentration is 40.8\u00b5g/m\u00b3 with a PM10 of 51.4\u00b5g/m\u00b3.\n\n27. Guangzhou, China\n\nAQI US: 119\n\nGuangzhou had an AQI of 149 around the end of 2020. Over the last few years, the city has taken strides in improving air quality, but still much needs to be done. Guangzhou is home to over 25 million with large economic activity which triggers pollution.\n\n26. Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina\n\nAQI US: 129\n\nCities in Bosnia and Herzegovina are plagued with air pollution due to the country\u2019s dependency on coal for internal heating and electricity generation. Its capital, Sarajevo, is one of the most air polluted cities in the world.\n\n25. Hanoi, Vietnam\n\nAQI US: 133\n\nHanoi\u2019s air quality fluctuates between 101-200 on a regular basis, from being unhealthy for sensitive groups to unhealthy for everyone. According to IQAir, 500 tonnes of charcoal and 700 tonnes of waste are burnt every day in the Vietnamese capital which is a primary source of the pollution there.\n\n24. Krak\u00f3w, Poland\n\nAQI US: 135\n\nKrak\u00f3w is among the most polluted cities in Europe. The Polish government has been actively working to improve air quality by delivering financial assistance to citizens to change their home heating systems, but a lot of more work still needs to be done.\n\n23. Karachi, Pakistan\n\nAQI US: 137\n\nTransport and industrial emissions are the major causes of pollution in Pakistan\u2019s largest city, Karachi. On December 4, it was ranked as the most polluted city in the world by IQAir with the AQI recorded at 244.\n\n22. Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia\n\nAQI US: 145\n\nUlaanbaatar is among the most air polluted cities in the world, with a PM2.5 concentration of 55.9\u00b5g/m\u00b3. According to IQAir, air quality in this Mongolian city has been hovering around the same dangerous levels since 2018.\n\n21. Bangkok, Thailand\n\nAQI US: 153\n\nThe air quality in Bangkok is deemed unhealthy for all people present there, due an AQI score in excess of 150. The city has a PM2.5 concentration of 53.5\u00b5g/m\u00b3 \u2013 which is more than 10 times higher than WHO\u2019s guidelines.\n\n20. Kaohsiung, Taiwan\n\nAQI US: 153\n\nKaohsiung is one of the most polluted cities in the worldfor air quality. To combat the challenge, Taiwan\u2019s government in 2019 announced to replace all coal power plants at the Hsinta Power Plant in Kaohsiung with natural gas-powered units by 2025.\n\n19. Belgrade, Serbia\n\nAQI US: 155\n\nBelgrade in Serbia is home to five of the fifteen most polluted districts in Europe, according to a report in The Guardian. Coal plants and emissions from old vehicles are the primary sources of air pollution in the city.\n\n18. Kathmandu, Nepal\n\nAQI US: 155\n\nThe air quality in Nepal\u2019s capital Kathmandu is unhealthy for all residents living in the city, with an AQI score of 155 and a PM2.5 concentration of 71.2\u00b5g/m\u00b3 \u2013 14 times higher than WHO\u2019s standards.\n\n17. Chongqing, China\n\nAQI US: 156\n\nChongqing, located in southwestern China, is among the most air-polluted cities in the world, with a PM2.5 concentration of 65\u00b5g/m\u00b3 and PM10 concentration of 102\u00b5g/m\u00b3 according to IQAir.\n\n16. Beijing, China\n\nAQI US: 157\n\nNext on the list is China\u2019s capital, Beijing, where air pollution is primarily caused by the use of coal to produce electricity, and emissions from manufacturing at factories and old vehicles.\n\n15. Baghdad, Iraq\n\nAQI US: 159\n\nMilitary conflicts in Iraq are one of the reasons for air pollution in Baghdad. With wars destroying much of the country\u2019s energy infrastructure, 30% of its electricity now comes from private diesel generators.\n\n14. Chengdu, China\n\nAQI US: 161\n\nThe air pollution levels in Chengdu are unhealthy for people of all age groups, according to IQAir. PM2.5 is the main air pollutant in this Chinese city and its concentration is 19 times higher than WHO\u2019s air quality guidelines.\n\n13. Wuhan, China\n\nAQI US: 163\n\nAnother Chinese city on the list is Wuhan, where air pollution is continuously deteriorating, despite government measures to control carbon emissions. The city has a PM2.5 concentration of 75\u00b5g/m\u00b3 and PM10 concentration of 86\u00b5g/m\u00b3.\n\n12. Hangzhou, China\n\nAQI US: 163\n\nHangzhou is one of the most air polluted cities in the world due to a large population of over 10.6 million people who commute daily for work, resulting in increased carbon emissions.\n\n11. Kabul, Afghanistan\n\nAQI US: 166\n\nKabul\u2019s air quality is unhealthy, according to IQAir. The primary reasons behind air pollution in Afghanistan\u2019s capital is poor fuel quality, old cars, burning of trash in public, industrial brick kilns, and no check on carbon emissions from factories.\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 10 Most Air Polluted Cities in the World.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n30 Most Polluted Countries in the World Heading into 2024 30 Most Polluted Cities in the U.S. 25 US Cities with Cleanest Air and Water\n\nDisclosure: None. 30 Most Air Polluted Cities In The World is originally published on Insider Monkey.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/30-most-air-polluted-cities-223614190.html", "symbols": ["0QYP.IL", "AMZ.DU", "AMZ.F", "AMZ.HM", "AMZ.MU", "AMZ.STU", "AMZ.XETRA", "AMZ1.F", "AMZN.BA", "AMZN.MX", "AMZN.NEO", "AMZN.SN", "AMZN.US", "AMZO34.SA", "JPM.US", "MSF.BE", "MSF.DU", "MSF.F", "MSF.HM"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": -0.998, "neg": 0.068, "neu": 0.892, "pos": 0.04}}, {"date": "2024-01-30T22:33:04+00:00", "title": "The 3 EV Stocks Most Likely to Outrun Tesla", "content": "Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is well known as the reigning king among EV stocks. The company has blazed a path forward in an industry that really didn\u2019t exist in the same way a decade ago. Accordingly, for most investors, Tesla is the EV sector, and it\u2019s the only stock that matters.\n\nThe market appears to be disagreeing lately, with Tesla seeing a major slide on a year-to-date basis alone. At the time of writing, TSLA stock is down 25% in 2024 alone, much of this driven by the company\u2019s recent earnings results (which underwhelmed, to put it nicely).\n\nMany in the EV space are now looking for alternatives. As a global game, and given Tesla\u2019s current dominance in the North American market, I think we need to look around the world for some picks. Here are three companies I think have what it takes to eat into Tesla\u2019s global market share over time.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBYD Co. (BYDDF) A close-up view of the power supply plugged into a vehicle from BYD Company (BYDDY).\n\nSource: J. Lekavicius / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn December, China-based BYD Co\u2019s (OTCMKTS:BYDDF)\u00a0global deliveries numbers skyrocketed to 36,095 units, representing a 209% increase from the previous year. This impressive rise is expected to continue. In January, BYD started auto shipments through its very first PTCT vessel, with a new Thailand-based factory awaiting to begin operations. In late 2023, a price war escalated, prompting BYD and other Chinese EV makers to slash prices and offer discounts. As a result, by the first half of 2023, BYD became the largest automaker in China and the 10th in the world.\n\nTesla exceeded expectations by delivering 484,507 EVs in Q4 and consequently achieved 1.81 million in annual deliveries for 2023. BYD said, \u201cnot bad,\u201d delivering more than 3 million vehicles and overtaking Tesla as the global BEV sales leader in Q4 with deliveries of 526,409 units. It is an outstanding feat made possible through the contributions and several brand segments.\n\nTirelessly innovating, BYD is looking to dominate the EV sector in Israel and just set its eyes on Europe and Latin America. Atto 3, Dolphin and Seal are parts of a strong export strategy, but I expect newer models to roll out in 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nRivian (RIVN) A new Rivian R1T truck is seen at a Rivian service center in South San Francisco, California. Rivian Automotive, (RIVN) is an electric vehicle automaker. RIVN stock price predictions\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nRivian Automotive (NASDAQ:RIVN), a stand-out among EV startups, has managed to swerve away from a head-on collission with Tesla. Instead of competing in the same product categories, Rivian has chosen to focus on pickup trucks and SUVs, areas of the EV market where Tesla is not currently dominant. (In the views of many the Cybertruck really isn\u2019t a pickup in the same way the Model Y isn\u2019t really the three-row-type SUV that was promised.)\n\nRivian\u2019s initial surge upon going public was tied to the company\u2019s links to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Amazon has backed Rivian from the beginning, also providing the company with a hefty order for its delivery vans (yet another niche segment Rivian is after).\n\nWith e-commerce sales steadily rising, it\u2019s no surprise to see delivery vans take center stage as a key growth area of focus for Rivian and others. Amazon already has around 10,000 Rivian delivery vans on the road, and is aggressively pursuing electrification. This is a narrative I don\u2019t hear much about, but it\u2019s pretty central to the Rivian thesis over the long term.\n\nI do think Rivian is likely among the higher-risk, higher-upside picks in the U.S. EV space. However, this is a company backed by a major company looking to reduce its cash burn and ramp up production. If investors can see a path to profitability, this is a stock that could soar.\n\nLi Auto (LI) Li Auto electric car retail store with customers. Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nLi Auto (NASDAQ:LI) has risen above the chaos of the volatile EV market, and become a front-runner in the Chinese EV space.\u00a0 Despite depressed stock as a result of market sentiment, optimistic analysts estimate a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 20x for the company. Li\u2019s delivery growth was impressive in 2023, with more than 376,000 vehicles delivered, showcasing growth of more than 180%. Continued growth is expected, with the lacuna of the Li MEGA model in March.\n\nOn Jan. 11, Li Auto revealed updates of its L-series (L7, L8, L9) in 2024. These models are planned to be released in March, and have been offered at a discount through a lunar New Year promotion. The L-series has a large user base, proven by over 420,000 combined sales and over 50,000 monthly sales.\u00a0Thus, we\u2019ll have to see how this sales push turns out for the company.\n\nOverall, Li is among the top high-growth EV stocks in a still-growing market in China. Those betting on the global rise of EVs, and who think the Chinese market will be the place to be for the coming decades, may want to consider LI stock at these relatively attractive levels.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nChris MacDonald\u2019s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

So far, it has monetized its AI efforts via generative AI cloud services, its Copilot for Microsoft 365 productivity platform, and its Copilot Pro for consumers.\n\nStory continues\n\nEarlier this month, the company also opened up its Copilot for Microsoft 365 to all businesses, eliminating a prior requirement that customers needed to have 300 employees or more to sign up for the paid service. Clients pay $30 per user per month for access to the software. Copilot Pro for consumers, meanwhile, costs $20 per month per user, and is meant for consumer customers who want to take advantage of Copilot\u2019s more advanced features.\n\nMicrosoft, as well as rivals Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN), have been pouring billions of dollars into AI investments over the last year, as they each seek to gain the upper hand in the race to be the AI software leader.\n\nMicrosoft grabbed an early lead thanks to its investment in ChatGPT developer OpenAI, but Google and Amazon are gaining ground. Google released its powerful Gemini AI model in December, and, in September, Amazon announced a $4 billion investment in AI company Anthropic giving the cloud giant a minority ownership position in the firm.\n\nBut generative AI technology has come under fire recently, as users on X posted AI-generated explicit images of Taylor Swift. The move has prompted more calls for legislation targeting so-called deepfake images and videos. Sign up for the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.

The company originally announced the plan in September, saying that \u200b\u200bit was needed, \u201cto continue investing in compelling content and keep increasing that investment.\u201d\n\nAmazon claimed in its original announcement that Prime Video will show fewer ads than regular TV or other streaming services, but those who want to avoid them altogether will have to pay an additional $2.99 per month on top of the $14.99 monthly fee that already exists.\n\nThe change comes as the company has increased the amount it spends on content to fill out its Prime offerings. In 2022, the company finalized founder Jeff Bezos's $8.5 billion purchase of MGM, in what was its second-most expensive acquisition at the time. Since then, Amazon has beefed up spending, including a $16 billion splurge on content in 2022, $7 billion of which went to original programming.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2023, the company\u2019s most recent earnings report, Amazon made just over $10 billion from its subscription services unit, which includes Prime and other non-Amazon Web Services subscription services in digital video, audiobooks, digital music, and e-books. Experts predict that the new changes to Prime Video could provide an added boost.\n\nAnalysts at Morgan Stanley predict that the company\u2019s changes could bring in an extra $3.3 billion in advertising revenue in 2024. Meanwhile, New York\u2013based media investment firm MoffettNathanson had lower predictions but still said Amazon will bring in $1.3 billion from advertisers in 2024 and another $2.3 billion next year.\n\nThe company is predicting that 159 million of its subscribers will immediately be exposed to ads on the platform, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing an internal presentation Amazon made for potential advertisers. That number may be enticing to companies looking to reach more eyeballs, as it beats out the 23 million monthly active users that are exposed to ads on market leader Netflix\u2019s platform.\n\nStory continues\n\nStill, Prime customers are mostly unhappy about the change and have taken to social media to complain about the new ads on the platform. Many have chalked up Prime\u2019s ads rollout to corporate greed.\n\nPrime video now has ads???@amazon@PrimeVideo why are you so greedy? #cancelprimepic.twitter.com/FjtKDGwnTS\n\n\u2014 Ray Meyer (@rmeyer1126) January 30, 2024\n\nI'm disappointed to hear that Amazon Prime Video is introducing ads.

In December 2022, Disney+ introduced an ad-supported tier at the same time that it announced a $3 monthly price hike for its ad-free plan. It then hiked prices another $3 per month in August.\n\nNetflix, which at 260 million subscribers worldwide has more than double the customers of any other streaming service, cracked down on password sharing, along with debuting its own advertising tier, in a bid to improve profitability. These helped Netflix, which is emerging as the undisputed winner of the streaming wars, crush its last earnings with the biggest boost of new subscribers since the pandemic. Of course, Netflix kicked off streaming's pivot from growth to profitability by reporting a subscriber drop in 2022, contributing to the flood of advertising into streaming, now including Amazon Prime.\n\nWhile the percentage of U.S. households that subscribe to streaming services had stayed between 80% and 83% each quarter for the past two years, the end of 2023 saw that number jump to 85%, exceeding expectations and spurring hopes that there is still more room to grow in the streaming sector.\n\nAmazon did not respond to a request for comment from Fortune.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-prime-now-charging-want-182143577.html", "symbols": ["AMZ.DU", "AMZ.F", "AMZ.HM", "AMZ.MU", "AMZ.STU", "AMZ.XETRA", "AMZ1.F", "AMZN.BA", "AMZN.MX", "AMZN.NEO", "AMZN.SN", "AMZN.US", "AMZO34.SA", "NFC.F", "NFC.XETRA", "NFC1.F", "NFLX.MX", "NFLX.NEO", "NFLX.US", "NFLX34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.984, "neg": 0.051, "neu": 0.847, "pos": 0.102}}, {"date": "2024-01-30T16:48:43+00:00", "title": "Logistics, delivery heft could help Amazon margins, profitability", "content": "By Arriana McLymore\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Whether Amazon.com can cash in on its delivery heft by boosting fee revenue from its \"Buy With Prime\" service after a 2022 overhaul of its logistics network will be a big focus for investors when the e-commerce giant reports fourth-quarter results on Thursday.\n\nAmazon's 200 million Prime members pay $14.99 per month or $139 annually for free shipping in a day or two, and with Buy With Prime, launched in April 2022, merchants can extend the shipping offer to those Prime customers.\n\nThe strategy is simple: use its existing infrastructure to handle packages and orders that aren't placed on Amazon itself in order to generate additional fee revenue for its seller services, which is a high-margin business.\n\nAmazon collects 3% service fees on each Buy With Prime order, with additional payments for fulfillment and payment processing.\n\nAmazon is expected to report a fourth-quarter profit of $29.3 billion, an increase of 34.41% from $21.79 billion in last year's quarter, according to estimates from LSEG.\n\nThe Seattle-based e-commerce giant's margins are expected to be 17.62% compared to last year's 14.60%, according to estimates from LSEG.\n\nAmazon hasn't disclosed how many merchants are using Buy With Prime, and the company declined to comment on the number of those vendors.\n\nSince its roll-out, Amazon has partnered with Shopify and Salesforce, both of which enable sellers to set up e-stores, to offer Buy With Prime to more than 2 million merchants while giving online sellers access to the 200 million Prime subscribers.\n\nBuy With Prime's business model is a \"win win\" for Amazon, outside merchants and Prime members, said Arun Sundaram, vice president of equity research at CFRA Research.\n\n\"Customers get fast delivery, Amazon gets these high-margin fees from the merchants and merchants get more traction onto their websites,\" Sundaram said.\n\nJim Tierney, chief investment officer of Concentrated U.S. Growth at AllianceBernstein, said that a \"huge discovery\" for his firm was the potential for Amazon to lower its costs and boost fee revenues after restructuring its fulfillment network to increase delivery speeds.

Its tonneau covers will be\u00a0compatible with a wide range of popular truck models, including\u00a0Ford and its star F series, as well as\u00a0RAM\u00a0and Jeep\u00a0by Stellantis\u00a0(NYSE: STLA), General Motors\u00a0(NYSE: GM) brands\u00a0GMC and Chevrolet, Nissan\u00a0Motor Co Ltd (OTC: NSANY), and ToyotaMotor (NYSE: TM) light trucks.\u00a0Worksport plans to strategically expand\u00a0its market reach\u00a0and\u00a0extend its compatibility\u00a0to also\u00a0include the Honda\u00a0Motor Co Ltd (NYSE: HMC)\u00a0Ridgeline.\u00a0Durable, functional and stylish,\u00a0this new product is proudly\u00a0made in the USA with\u00a0more than\u00a090% domestically sourced components,\u00a0the AL3 cover is now available on the Worksport e-commerce site and it is on its way to Amazon, eBay, and Walmart through the company\u2019s rapidly exchanging network.\n\nWorksport plans to kick off sales efforts in early February with first client meetings as it runs to catch its estimated $3 billion tonneau cover market with approximately 60 million pickup trucks already on the roads.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeanwhile, GM And Ford Are Scaling Back Their EV Plans\n\nBack in October, General Motors postponed the opening of its $4 billion electric truck plant in Michigan for a year.\u00a0In December,\u00a0Ford told suppliers that it planned to produce about 1,600 F-150 Lightning EV trucks per week\u00a0as ofJanuary, roughly half of the 3,200 it previously had planned.\u00a0Back in August, Ford had said the plant that builds F-150 Lightning reach an annual production rate of 150,000 vehicles by October after saying in 2022 it would double EV truck production. But on Friday,\u00a0it shifted back to gas-powered vehicles by revealing it will cut the factory\u2019s workforce from two shifts two one and reallocate about two thirds of workers mostly to factories that produce gas-powered\u00a0Bronco SUVs and Ranger pickups.\u00a0Moreover, Ford delivered the news of F-150 production cuts while\u00a0Detroit automakers\u00a0expressed their discontent with the\u00a0Biden Administration\u2019s\u00a0proposals to use emissions rules that would result in 67% of all new vehicles in 2032 being EVs.\u00a0Ford is still guiding for\u00a0continued growth in global EV sales\u00a0this year, but\u00a0still sees it being\u00a0less than anticipated.\n\nBut Stellantis Is Not Slowing Down\n\nAlso on Friday,\u00a0Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares\u00a0informed reporters that\u00a0the automaker has no plans to slow down its EV production. However, Tavares did acknowledge that this year\u2019s US and European presidential elections could change\u00a0the pace of\u00a0EV adoption, and although the slowdown is one of the two scenarios, there\u2019s no stopping due to global warming. Later this year, Stellantis will be putting its ram 1500 Rev and its plug-in hybrid peer Ram 1500 Ramcharger on sale.\n\nTesla Is Also Not Showing Any Signs Of Stopping Despite Challenges\n\nWhile admitting it is a challenging journey,\u00a0Tesla is\u00a0doing its best\u00a0to\u00a0ramp\u00a0up production of its Cybertruck at its\u00a0Austin, Texas\u00a0factory.\u00a0Moreover, Tesla CEO Elon Musk confirmed\u00a0on a post-earnings call on that the\u00a0EV king\u00a0expects to start production of its next-generation\u00a0mass market\u00a0EV at\u00a0this\u00a0factory\u00a0during\u00a0the second half of 2025, which will be followed by its facility in\u00a0Mexico and another factory outside North America\u00a0which will\u00a0be decided\u00a0upon\u00a0later this year.\n\nWith\u00a0Tesla continuing\u00a0to cut vehicle prices in Europe and China, eliminating the obstacle of higher prices and with innovative players like Worksports, addressing driving range anxiety and\u00a0concerns over\u00a0charger availability,\u00a0the EV evolution is undoubtedly advancing in the right direction. With Worksport\u2019s news,\u00a0even e-commerce titans Amazon and Walmart are making their footprint in the EV universe that is unquestionably the future in\u00a0the making. As Stellantis CEO noted, when it comes to EVs, the only options are going faster or slower, but either way, there\u2019s no stopping.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

This is anticipated to be reflected in the company\u2019s fourth-quarter results.\r\n\r\nWe note that the solid momentum across AWS has been aiding Amazon in generating high margins from the cloud business. The trend is expected to have continued in the yet-to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nAWS\u2019 revenues were $23.06 billion, accounting for 12.3% of net sales in third-quarter 2023, rising 16.1% year over year. We further note that its operating income was $6.98 billion, up 29.1% year over year.\r\n\r\nAn expanding customer base and a strong discount offering for long-term deals are likely to have driven AWS\u2019 top line in the quarter under review.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter 2023 AWS net sales is pegged at $24.32 billion, indicating an improvement of 13.8% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s reported figure.\r\n\r\nClick here to know how the company\u2019s overall fourth-quarter results are likely to be.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc.

Quote\n\nFactors to Note\n\nThe strengthening cloud services portfolio on the back of generative AI technology and expanding data center networks are likely to have benefited the performance of AWS during the fourth quarter.\r\n\r\nThe increasing number of AWS regions and availability zones might have remained a positive. In the quarter under review, AWS launched its second infrastructure region in Canada, located in Calgary.\r\n\r\nAll these factors are expected to have aided Amazon in sustaining momentum among existing cloud customers and attracting new ones.\r\n\r\nIn the fourth quarter, Trip.com TCOM selected AWS as its strategic cloud provider. Trip.com is leveraging AWS\u2019 robust infrastructure and cloud services to support its global expansion and deliver an enhanced travel experience by offering cost-effective travel booking services and hassle-free on-the-go customer service support.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Hyundai, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, SCAYLE and BYD selected AWS as the preferred cloud provider.\r\n\r\nAWS was also picked by Axiata Group Berhad as the primary cloud provider.\r\n\r\nAerodyne, a drone solution provider, went all-in on AWS to solve complex industrial issues with drone data.\r\n\r\nCathay selected AWS as its strategic cloud partner to establish the Cathay Machine Learning Innovation Hub.\r\n\r\nThe Bank of Ayudhya Public Company Limited (Krungsri) also picked AWS to boost its digital transformation and accelerate the financial inclusion drive in Thailand.\r\n\r\nApart from these, Amgen AMGN partnered with AWS to expand the usage of the latter\u2019s cloud solutions.

Could artificial intelligence (AI) emulate his success? I recently discovered an intriguing AI model called the \u201cBuffett Bot\u201d that was trained to mimic Warren Buffett.\n\nAs AI continues making strides across industries, it\u2019s no surprise some clever developers have aimed these analytical engines at the financial markets. And basing one on the Oracle of Omaha himself seems like an especially smart play. Of course, this AI isn\u2019t the real Buffett, but it offers a fascinating glimpse into how modern data science attempts to replicate legendary investors.\n\nI\u2019ll be taking a look at the stock picks recently put forward by this Buffett-inspired AI. The model imitates Buffett\u2019s penchant for finding strong yet reasonably-valued businesses. It will be intriguing to see what kind of companies and sectors the Buffett Bot highlights as solid investments. While this AI is unlikely to fully capture the depth of real-world experience and nuanced judgment behind Buffett\u2019s brilliance, it may still surface some appealing prospects. At the very least, its selections should provide thoughtful food for thought.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMoody\u2019s (MCO) A Moody's Corporation (MCO) sign in silver.\n\nSource: Daniel J. Macy / Shutterstock.com\n\nMoody\u2019s (NYSE:MCO) holds an enormously influential position in global finance as one of the \u201cBig Three\u201d credit ratings agencies alongside S&P (NYSE:SPGI) and Fitch. This oligopoly enjoys durable competitive advantages from high barriers to entry and a sticky customer base. Thus, I\u2019m not surprised to see Buffett Bot tap Moody\u2019s as a smart Buffett-style bet.\n\nAfter all, the real Buffett also knows a thing or two about this industry leader \u2013 MCO occupies a sizable 2.6% allocation in Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s (NYSE:BRK-B) portfolio. For a man with a highly concentrated portfolio anchored by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), carving out such a large niche for Moody\u2019s signals conviction in its prospects.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd why shouldn\u2019t Buffett have this conviction? Moody\u2019s just delivered another quarter of impressive growth in Q3 2023. Revenue grew 15% year-over-year, powered by strong performance across ratings and research, data and analytics, and M&A. Meanwhile, the company\u2019s EBITDA leapt 32%.\n\nNo doubt, Moody\u2019s trades at a steep premium. Its shares currently command a valuation of roughly 12-times forward sales and 39-times forward earnings. However, the company\u2019s growth prospects support these rich valuations. Analysts forecast annual earnings per share growth of around 15% over the next five years on the back of near double-digit revenue expansion. In an entrenched triopoly that\u2019s strategically expanding its presence across high-margin adjacencies, I believe Moody\u2019s warrants its above-average multiple.\n\nAs an added bonus: Moody\u2019s pays out a small but growing dividend that yields 0.8%. Moody\u2019s offers compelling total return potential as a Buffett-approved blue-chip with fortress positioning in an essential global industry. I agree with the Oracle and his digital doppelg\u00e4nger that this is a long-term winner.\n\nBrookfield Asset Management (BAM) bam international stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nWhile not currently a Berkshire holding, Brookfield Asset Management (NYSE:BAM) aligns nicely with the Buffett school of thought. This alternative asset manager focuses on real assets like infrastructure, real estate, renewables, and private equity \u2013 tangible categories that benefit society. Its value-based approach centers on acquiring high-quality assets during times of distress or dislocation to generate strong risk-adjusted returns.\n\nIn other words, Brookfield brings a long-term lens to its investing framework, and is backed by a strong balance sheet \u2013 key \u201cBuffettesque\u201d principles. So, I understand why a digital version of the Oracle tapped Brookfield as an intriguing pick. As attention pivots toward renewable energy and infrastructure spending while real estate rebounds from pandemic lows, this is a company with plenty of tailwinds to consider.\n\nThe company\u2019s growth forecasts look promising, too. Brookfield anticipates 17% annualized sales growth over the next two years alongside 19% earnings growth in 2025. While its forward price-earnings ratio of 26-times based on estimated 2024 earnings seems somewhat rich, I believe this premium makes sense for a company eyeing high-teens bottom-line boosts. Plus, shareholders get paid to wait via a 3.2% dividend yield that should keep growing.\n\nI agree with Buffett Bot that BAM stock warrants a spot in a long-term-focused portfolio.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon LOGO ON THE SIDE OF A BUILDING.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that Buffett largely missed the boat on new tech like AI over the years. But the small Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) position (recently trimmed) in Berkshire\u2019s portfolio proves that even old dogs can learn some new tricks. And while Buffett may not be ready to fully embrace fast-moving tech disruptors, his digital descendant shows more enthusiasm in tapping Amazon\u2019s immense potential.\n\nNow, AMZN stock trades at a nosebleed valuation. Shares of the e-commerce giant currently trade for more than 82-times trailing earnings. But when you dominate the secular growth engines of e-commerce and cloud like Amazon does, lofty multiples feel warranted. Remember, AWS alone commands a 41.5% market share in the cloud, greater than Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), and IBM (NYSE:IBM) combined!\n\nMeanwhile, early pandemic aftershocks to the e-commerce sector have settled, paving the way for growth re-acceleration. Over the last three years, Amazon\u2019s net sales grew outpaced over 84% of marketwide peers. And though its price-earnings ratio seems extremely rich for a company of this scale, it falls below Amazon\u2019s 5-year average near 120-times.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

This particularly applies to tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.\n\nWhat if you'd invested in Amazon (AMZN) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to AMZN for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?\n\nAmazon's Business In-Depth\n\nWith that in mind, let's take a look at Amazon's main business drivers.\n\nAmazon.com is one of the largest e-commerce providers, with sprawling operations in North America, now spreading across the globe.\r\n\r\nIts online retail business revolves around the Prime program well-supported by the company\u2019s massive distribution network. Further, the Whole Foods Market acquisition helped Amazon establish footprint in physical grocery supermarket space.\n\nAmazon also enjoys dominant position in the cloud-computing market, particularly in the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) space, thanks to Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is one of its high-margin generating businesses.\n\nAmazon has also become a household name with its Alexa powered Echo devices. Artificial Intelligence (AI) backed Alexa is helping the company sell products and services.\n\nRevenues were $513.98 billion in 2022. The company reports revenue under three broad heads\u2014North America, International and AWS, which generated 61.5%, 23% and 15.6% of total revenues, respectively.\n\nHeadquartered in Seattle, WA, Amazon targets three categories of customers\u2014consumers, sellers and website developers. Consumers are offered variety, convenience and free delivery of goods displayed on the company\u2019s websites.\r\n\r\nThe agreements with sellers are varied, enabling them to use the company\u2019s websites to either sell their merchandise directly, or redirect customers to the sellers\u2019 own branded websites. In case of the latter arrangement, Amazon earns a fee for the sales thus generated.\n\nStory continues\n\nCompetition comes in the form of traditional retailers, other online retailers, media companies, web portals, search engines, e-commerce companies and cloud computing service providers.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAnyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio requires research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in Amazon ten years ago, you're likely feeling pretty good about your investment today.\n\nAccording to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in January 2014 would be worth $8,394.59, or a gain of 739.46%, as of January 30, 2024, and this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.\n\nThe S&P 500 rose 177.76% and the price of gold increased 57.24% over the same time frame in comparison.\n\nAnalysts are anticipating more upside for AMZN.\n\nAmazon\u2019s shares have outperformed the industry over a year. The company is gaining on solid Prime momentum owing to ultrafast delivery services and strong content portfolio. Strengthening relationship with third-party sellers is a positive. Additionally, strong adoption rate of AWS is aiding the company\u2019s cloud dominance. Expanding AWS services portfolio is continuously helping Amazon in gaining further momentum among the customers. Robust Alexa skills and expanding smart home products portfolio are positives. The company\u2019s strong global presence and solid momentum among the small and medium businesses remain tailwinds. Considering the abovementioned facts, we expect 2023 revenue to be up 10.8% from 2022. However, inflationary pressure, geopolitical tensions and foreign currency headwinds remain concerns.\n\nShares have gained 6.13% over the past four weeks and there have been 5 higher earnings estimate revisions for fiscal 2023 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

It not only beat estimates for the quarter, but management also projected higher growth than consensus estimates.\n\nWhile reviewing the company's performance, I observed that management has prioritized stronger free cash in addition to growth while also noting robust demand among paid members. This leads me to believe Netflix's stock is undervalued at current levels.\n\nBusiness model recap\n\nNetflix was founded in the dot-com era as a DVD-by-mail service, allowing users to rent its DVDs online and have them mailed to them. Over the years, the company has gone through a few business transformations as preferences in the target market evolved. Its most well-known and successful transformation to date is turning the company into the most popular video streaming platform in the world by leveraging AWS's cloud infrastructure.\n\nThe company always prioritized an ad-free experience for paying members, but as costs for everyday products and services soared in the post-pandemic era, consumer demand for Netflix's streaming subscription fell precipitously, forcing it to offer subscription plans at cheaper prices with ads. The company also leveraged another opportunity with paid-sharing by allowing family members or friends to share their Netflix account with other family members or friends for a small fee. So far, these strategies seem to have worked for Netflix.\n\nSince it is an app-based subscription-based business, metrics such as volume of paying members and average revenue per member are important metrics to review, in my opinion, to monitor the growth prospects of the business.\n\nStrong fourth-quarter and full-year performance\n\nFor the fourth quarter of 2023, Netflix beat revenue estimates by 1.3% at $8.8 billion. For the full year, the company's revenue trajectory reversed course back into growth mode, recording 11% year-over-year growth. But what was more interesting to me is that the company expects even stronger growth in 2024, projecting healthy double-digit revenue growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nI believe a majority of the catalysts Netflix may be referring to as they project higher growth this year can be seen in the renewed durability of its subscriber numbers in the table below. Netflix Is 'Back to Business as Usual' Following Strong Growth\n\nFrom the chart above, it is apparent the Europe, Middle East and Africa region has emerged as the top region for Netflix in terms of paid subscriber ads, growing at almost 16% on a year-over-year basis, twice as fast as the number of paid members being added from the U.S. and Canada and almost as fast as the fastest-growing region, Asia Pacifica and China, which is growing at 19% year over year. I believe much of the growth in the EMEA can be attributed to the sustained performance of Netflix's content, such as \"The Crown,\" which drove higher net-paid member additions to its streaming platform.\n\nHowever, I suspect another factor that drove the surge in paid members is the password-sharing crackdown it initiated last year. While many studies have shown a mixed impact on Netflix's revenue, I believe on a net-net basis, this actually added about 15% incremental revenue to Netflix based on this study.\n\nIn terms of operational efficiency, I observe that Netflix's management has prioritized margin expansion this year, as seen from the chart below. Management has also been guided to sustain growth in profit margins over time. Netflix Is 'Back to Business as Usual' Following Strong Growth\n\nNetflix also has a history of holding debt. As of the most recent quarter, the company had around $15 billion in debt. With around $7 billion in cash, Netflix's debt position may look risky. But the company has demonstrated its ability to manage its debt, as is consistent with most large, well-managed enterprises. It has been leaning on a pre-pandemic strategy of issuing high-yield bonds to fund the acquisition and production of content that drives its entire streaming platform. But in 2022, the company announced a move away from its indebted strategy and used its free cash to fund its content plans. In the recent quarter, Netflix pleasantly surprised me by posting roughly $7 billion in free cash, which is approximately four times more than the free cash it recorded in 2022. Moreover, management projected approximately $6 billion in free cash by the end of 2024. Although that will mark a slight deceleration in the growth of the free cash, I still see this as a positive development for Netflix's debt position.\n\nIn terms of valuation, I will assume consensus estimates of margins at 24%. Netflix is guiding for 26% margins in the first quarter of 2024, but I expect that to average out over the remaining three quarters of the year. Based on management's commentary, the ad-tier subscription is a high-margin business, but will only start to meaningfully impact the top and bottom lines from next year onwards. I see the ad-tier subscription as accretive to Netflix's bottom line since it is a high-margin segment. Therefore, I expect margins to grow to 26% over the next five years. Netflix Is 'Back to Business as Usual' Following Strong Growth\n\nNow given that Netflix's operating income will grow at a CAGR of 13.3% over the next five years, which is higher than the 8% average growth in the S&P500, I find it reasonable to pay a premium of 29 times forward earnings. In this case, I expect room for upside from Netflix's current valuation levels.\n\nRisks and other factors to consider\n\nSince Netflix is in the business of selling subscriptions to its streaming platform, I will view this as a consumer discretionary business. Most consumer discretionary businesses tend to be cyclical, as consumers alter their spending patterns based on economic cycles. One of those economic cycles was seen in 2022 as costs soared across the board, consumers cut discretionary spending and Netflix was at the receiving end with revenues declining. Although economists project the global economy will grow about 2.40% in 2024, I will expect the company to be impacted in the case of a surprise recession.\n\nNetflix can also be impacted if it slows the roadmap of its content products. I noted earlier how global content launches had led to a sustained surge in paid members, specifically in the EMEA region. If Netflix is forced to slow down its content plans, it may impact the growth of net-paid members on its platform, which will eventually impact growth. Further, if the quality of content or content licensing worsens, paid members may cancel their subscriptions, causing revenue to decline.\n\nFinally, streaming has become an extremely fragmented, hard-fought industry with multiple players, including Amazon Prime (NASDAQ:AMZN), Disney (NYSE:DIS) and others. Streaming platform differentiation is key here, and Netflix aims to differentiate its platform based on its strengths, which include prices and subscription tiers, content and product features. While the entire streaming industry is maturing and industry players are experimenting with different business formats, I find Netflix's strategy the most interesting. For the first time, the company announced in the earnings call, the size of its total addressable market at $600 billion, which today equals 5% penetration. Netflix's TAM has expanded beyond streaming and now includes Gaming, Connected TV and ad-tiers. Also, for the first time, management announced its ad business has been growing 70% sequentially this quarter. While these are very early days for Netflix's ad tier, I strongly feel the company is well-positioned to benefit from a robust ad-based streaming industry. Management also noted the progress it is making in building out ad-based partnership products and ad-measurement tools that eventually generate meaningful high-margin revenue contributions to Netflix's top line.\n\nTakeaways\n\nNetflix's recent quarter demonstrates the focus and ability of its management to deliver on long-term goals of prioritizing high-margin growth while growing free cash at the same time. The company's pivot away from its debt strategy is working while subscribers are returning to the platform. Given all of the recent developments, I see upside for Netflix.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netflix-back-business-usual-following-130108696.html", "symbols": ["AMZN.US", "DIS.US", "NFC.F", "NFC.XETRA", "NFC1.F", "NFLX.MX", "NFLX.NEO", "NFLX.US", "NFLX34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 1, "neg": 0.033, "neu": 0.82, "pos": 0.148}}, {"date": "2024-01-30T12:00:14+00:00", "title": "Amazon Takes Its Roomba Back to the Store", "content": "(Bloomberg) -- There are two ways to look at the collapse of Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s deal to buy iRobot Corp., which makes Roomba vacuum cleaners.

Faced with the choice of going to war with regulators \u2014 potentially in a years-long quagmire on both sides of the Atlantic \u2014 or cutting its losses, Amazon chose to bail.\n\nFrom its home base in Bedford, Massachusetts, iRobot has long punched above its weight. The Roomba has been so successful that it defined its own product category.\n\nWhat competitors lacked in brand recognition, though, they made up for in low prices and shipping volume. The robot vacuum market now has \u201can unprecedented number of players,\u201d according to Parks Associates, which tracks smart home devices. That includes a multitude of startups, South Korean and Chinese electronics giants and stalwart vacuum brands like Bissell and Dyson.\n\nIn a survey of US households with home internet that Parks Associates conducted in early 2019, 63% of respondents who owned a robot vacuum reported having a Roomba. By the end of last year, that share was down to 48%.\n\nIRobot has blamed \u201cincreased pricing competition\u201d for dragging on sales. It held layoffs in 2022 and 2023, subleased part of its headquarters and scaled back advertising and research and development. The company has incurred about $500 million in losses since 2021.\n\nWhen Amazon called off its $1.4 billion purchase on Monday, iRobot announced yet another round of cuts, totaling 31% of its workforce, and the departure of its chief executive officer.\n\nStory continues\n\nSpokespeople for Amazon and IRobot declined to comment beyond their public statements. In one of them, David Zapolsky, Amazon\u2019s general counsel, said the termination of the deal will \u201cdeny consumers faster innovation and more competitive prices, which we\u2019re confident would have made their lives easier and more enjoyable.\u201d\n\nAmazon's top lawyer also suggested the regulatory scrutiny from Washington and Brussels would prove self-defeating: \u201cMergers and acquisitions like this help companies like iRobot better compete in the global marketplace, particularly against companies, and from countries, that aren\u2019t subject to the same regulatory requirements in fast-moving technology segments like robotics.\u201d\n\nThe retreat is something of a new look for Amazon, which has defended itself against past charges of anticompetitive practices, betting its moves would stand up in court if it came to it. Amazon faced down skeptical regulators during its recent purchases of MGM and One Medical. With iRobot, Amazon didn\u2019t even offer European regulators a compromise, or what\u2019s known in regulatory negotiations as a merger remedy.\n\nThe financial impact to Amazon of walking away will be minimal: a $94 million breakup fee, which iRobot will use to pay down debt and compensate its financial advisers. For Amazon, which has $64 billion in cash, it\u2019s like a restocking fee.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThere\u2019s So Much Data Even Spies Are Struggling to Find Secrets Basketball, Basketball, Basketball: Inside Steve Ballmer\u2019s New $2 Billion Arena How a Lucky Break Fueled Eli Lilly\u2019s $600 Billion Weight-Loss Empire AI Needs So Much Power That Old Coal Plants Are Sticking Around How to Handle the Dreaded Political Shop Talk at Work\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-takes-roomba-back-store-120014617.html", "symbols": ["AMZ.DU", "AMZ.F", "AMZ.HM", "AMZ.MU", "AMZ.STU", "AMZ.XETRA", "AMZ1.F", "AMZN.BA", "AMZN.MX", "AMZN.NEO", "AMZN.SN", "AMZN.US", "AMZO34.SA", "I8R.BE", "I8R.F", "I8R.MU", "I8R.STU", "IRBT.US"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.88, "neg": 0.064, "neu": 0.844, "pos": 0.092}}, {"date": "2024-01-30T11:27:40+00:00", "title": "12 Best Internet Retail Stocks to Buy", "content": "In this article, we discuss the 12 best internet retail stocks to buy. To skip our analysis of the e-commerce and online retail industry, go directly to the 5 Best Internet Retail Stocks to Buy.\n\nIn recent years, e-commerce has evolved into a crucial component of the global retail landscape. The internet's advent has brought about significant transformations in the buying and selling of goods, mirroring broader shifts toward digitalization in contemporary society. With the widespread adoption of the internet, consumers worldwide are reaping the benefits of seamless online transactions. The surge in global internet access, surpassing five billion users, has led to a continual rise in the number of individuals engaging in online purchases.\n\nA notable trend in the realm of e-commerce is the remarkable prevalence of mobile device usage. In 2023, smartphones constituted more than 70% of all retail website visits globally, subsequently generating the majority of online orders when compared to desktops and tablets. The swift adoption of mobile devices, particularly in regions with limited digital infrastructure, indicates that mobile integration will persistently influence the future shopping experience. Notably, mobile commerce (m-commerce) has gained significant popularity in Asia, with countries like China and South Korea generating over two-thirds of their total online sales through mobile devices.\n\nDuring the pandemic, e-commerce sales experienced significant growth as consumers avoided physical stores, leading to a surge in sales for certain products. Home improvement projects and electronic gadgets, in particular, saw increased spending as travel and entertainment options were limited. Throughout the pandemic, retailers faced challenges such as shortages and supply chain disruptions as they tried to meet the heightened demand. However, the situation has now shifted, with concerns about inflation and potential recessions influencing consumer behavior and resulting in excess inventory for some retailers. Following the aforementioned surge, numerous retail and consumer packaged goods companies experienced a notable deceleration in the growth of online sales in 2022. However, despite a return of consumers to physical stores, e-commerce is anticipated to represent 41% of global retail sales by 2027, marking a substantial rise from its 2017 share of merely 18%, as indicated by research from the Boston Consulting Group (BCG).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe strong performance of internet retail stocks, including those of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alibaba Group Holding Ltd \u2013 ADR (NYSE:BABA), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), can serve as a motivating factor for investors considering investments in the retail sector today. These companies are often regarded as some of the best retail stocks to buy at present. 12 Best Internet Retail Stocks to Buy\n\nA close-up of a customer's hands selecting beauty products from an online retailer.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nIn the process of compiling our selection of the best internet retail stocks, we initially identified companies involved in online retail and e-commerce.

(NYSE:SHOP) witnessed a notable 25% surge in total revenue, reaching $1.7 billion compared to the previous year. Monthly recurring revenue experienced robust growth, with a 32% increase, reaching $141 million, driven by sustained growth across all of Shopify\u2019s subscription plans. Moreover, the company reported an operating income of $122 million, reflecting a significant improvement from the $346 million loss reported a year ago.\n\nAs of Q3 2023, 69 out of the 910 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey held shares of Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP), with a combined value of $3.9 billion. Cathie Wood\u2019s hedge fund reported owning a stake worth $379.54 million by the end of the quarter.\n\nHere is what\u00a0Baron Global Advantage Fund\u00a0has to say about Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) in its Q3 2023 investor\u00a0letter:\n\n\u201cShopify Inc. is a cloud-based software provider for multi-channel commerce. Shares gave back some of their strong performance from the first half of 2023, declining 15.5% on the back of rising concerns related to the health of the consumer and the expansion of TikTok and Temu into the U.S. While we are cognizant of these near-term risks, we believe that Shopify will continue to benefit from its position as the commerce operating system for its merchants. Rather than replacing Shopify, various selling channels, including TikTok, are managed within the platform, which should enable Shopify to maintain its competitive advantage over the long term. During the quarter, Shopify announced an agreement with Amazon that will allow merchants to offer Buy with Prime within the Shopify ecosystem, enabling Shopify to act as the payments provider for these transactions and alleviating a key concern. Lastly, the company also reported strong financial results, including 17% year-over-year gross merchandise volume growth, 31% revenue growth, and consensus-beating non-GAAP operating income that outpaced estimates by over $90 million. We remain shareholders due to Shopify\u2019s strong competitive positioning, innovative culture, and long runway for growth, as it still holds less than a 2% share of the global commerce market.\u201d\n\nShopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) joins the ranks of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alibaba Group Holding Ltd \u2013 ADR (NYSE:BABA), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) as one of the best retail stocks to invest in.\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Best Internet Retail Stocks to Buy.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n15 Best Blue Chip Dividend Stocks To Buy 15 Stocks That Will Outperform the S&P 500 in 2024 12 Best German Dividend Stocks\n\nDisclosure.

Other countries are also slated to begin seeing ads.\n\nAmerican users must now fork over a $2.99 monthly fee to get an ad-free Prime Video streaming experience instead of the default with them. That is in addition to either the $14.99 they owe Amazon each month for an overall Prime membership or the $8.99 for Prime Video by itself.\n\nAMAZON NOTIFIES PRIME VIDEO USERS ADS WILL START JANUARY 29\n\nAmazon has kept the price at $14.99 a month for Prime since 2022, a price that is staying flat for those who do not upgrade to go ad free. Amazon Prime Video will start including advertisements next year, the company says, although it will be offering a new ad-free plan.\n\nNo matter which subscription users have, live events and Amazon Freevee programming will keep showing ads, the company said on its website.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\nCEO Andy Jassy said in late October that Prime Video \"continues to be an integral part of the Prime value proposition where it\u2019s often one of the top 2 drivers of customers signing up for Prime.\"\n\nAmazon, like other companies with streaming platforms, cited its aim to keep investing in its content as the reason for it bringing ads. Companies have also used ads to drum up more revenue from streaming.\n\nAMAZON LAYING OFF HUNDREDS AT PRIME VIDEO, MGM STUDIO, TWITCH DIVISIONS\n\nMax, Netflix and Disney+ are among the platforms that have previously debuted memberships with ads. A bowl of popcorn and TV remote control on a coffee table, with Netflix streaming on a television in the background, taken on March 6, 2020.\n\nSome streaming services have also been upping the prices of ad-free options and taking other steps to try to get users to increasingly embrace ad-supported plans. In this photo illustration, the logos of media service providers, Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Disney + and Hulu are displayed on the screen of a television on Nov. 20, 2019 in Paris.\n\nNetflix has seen particular success with its ad-supported tier. The company, which has restricted account-sharing outside of households, rolled the option out to certain countries in November 2022.\n\nThe number of monthly active Netflix users with the ad-supported plan has reached 23 million, the streaming giant said earlier in the month. It saw a jump of nearly 70% in subscriptions to the tier between the third and final quarters of 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nAMAZON TERMINATES IROBOT ACQUISITION DUE TO REGULATORY HURDLES\n\n\"Our aim is to make ads a more substantial revenue stream that contributes to sustained, healthy revenue growth in 2025 and beyond,\" Netflix said.\n\nEric Revell contributed to this report.\n\nOriginal article source:Amazon begins showing ads on Prime Video, jumping on a streaming trend", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-begins-showing-ads-prime-110021048.html", "symbols": ["AMZ.DU", "AMZ.F", "AMZ.HM", "AMZ.MU", "AMZ.STU", "AMZ.XETRA", "AMZ1.F", "AMZN.BA", "AMZN.MX", "AMZN.NEO", "AMZN.SN", "AMZN.US", "AMZO34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.988, "neg": 0.009, "neu": 0.891, "pos": 0.1}}, {"date": "2024-01-30T10:10:00+00:00", "title": "History Says the S&amp;P 500 May Climb in the Triple Digits During This Bull Market. 3 Top Growth Stocks to Buy Before it Does.", "content": "After a 2022 in the doldrums and a 2023 of recovery, investors finally were able to cheer this month. That's because the S&P 500 reached a new high, signaling we are indeed in a bull market. These sorts of markets only can be declared after they've begun. That's because, to be in bull territory, an index must climb 20% from its bear market low and reach a record high.\n\nBut that doesn't mean you're missing out on bull market gains if you only start investing right now. If we take a look into the past, history shows us bull markets generally last much longer than bear markets -- nearly nine years compared with 1.4 years, according to data compiled by Raymond James & Associates.\n\nAnd the data also show that during the past bull markets from the mid-1970s to the present, each bull market has delivered triple-digit gains. In fact, the S&P 500 climbed more than 280% over a period of about eight years during that last such phase. So, history suggests the S&P 500 -- so far up about 35% since its bear market low -- may advance in the triple digits during this bull market. Here are three top growth stocks to buy before it does. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) soared last year as it showed investors it could rebound from tough times -- and go on to grow. Hurt by rising inflation back in 2022, the company reported its first annual loss in almost a decade. But Amazon quickly turned things around by cutting costs, improving efficiency across its fulfillment network, and investing in key growth areas like artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThe efforts are bearing fruit, with Amazon shifting back to growth in operating income and reporting inflows of cash instead of outflows. In the most recent quarter, net sales climbed in the double digits, operating income quadrupled, and the company reported an inflow of more than $21 billion in cash compared with billion-dollar outflows a year earlier.\n\nMost importantly, though, the moves Amazon made will help the company continue to grow earnings -- and the results may be especially spectacular in a market favoring growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinally, I love the fact that Amazon is a leader in both e-commerce and cloud computing -- two markets expanding in the double digits.\n\nAll of this makes this stock an excellent one to own in a growth market.\n\n2. Intellia Therapeutics\n\nIntellia Therapeutics(NASDAQ: NTLA) develops candidates in the potentially game-changing area of CRISPR gene editing. I say \"game changing\" because gene editing fixes the faulty genes responsible for disease, therefore producing curative therapies.\n\nJust recently, regulators gave the first nod ever to a CRISPR-based product -- CRISPR Therapeutics' blood disorder treatment, Casgevy. This represents a key milestone for the whole industry because it shows regulators are amenable to approving treatments using this cutting-edge technology. (Intellia and CRISPR Therapeutics don't compete directly because they focus on different illnesses.)\n\nToday, Intellia is moving closer and closer to the finish line. The company is enrolling patients for a phase 3 trial of its candidate for transthyretin amyloidosis, a condition that impacts the heart and other organs. And Intellia completed enrollment in a phase 2 trial of its candidate for hereditary angioedema, a condition that involves extreme swelling.\n\nIntellia also is in a solid financial position to move these programs forward, with more than $1 billion in cash that could fund operations through mid-2026.\n\nIf Intellia's candidates continue to deliver positive results in their late-stage trials, the stock could move significantly higher from today's levels.\n\n3. Palantir Technologies\n\nPalantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR) in the most recent quarter reached a big milestone: $72 million in net income, its highest ever. The data analytics company, once best known for its work for governments, has made significant progress expanding its commercial business in recent times.\n\nAnd Palantir's launch of its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) last year offered it a significant boost. AIP brings the power of large language models to customers, helping them maximize the potential of their data. For example, Palantir, through AIP, has helped customers deploy AI-based process mining and automation workflows. By understanding and streamlining a company's processes, that company can save both time and money.\n\nIn the most recent quarter, Palantir's U.S. commercial revenue increased 33%, and its U.S. commercial customer count climbed 37%. This is key because chief executive officer Alex Karp calls this business \"the new and emerging center of our company.\" At the same time, Palantir's government revenue continues to advance in the double digits, showing this company has what it takes to win in both business areas.\n\nPalantir shares trade for 55x forward earnings estimates right now, a very reasonable level for a leading AI growth stock -- and one that could stand out in the new bull market.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Amazon wasn't one of them.

And It Looks Dirt Cheap Right Now.", "content": "Cathie Wood and Warren Buffett don't have a ton in common.\n\nBuffett is an investor who traditionally seeks steady growth and often looks for dividend plays. This simple investment strategy has become a modern-day staple for investors of all ages. On the other side, Wood has taken bullish stances on emerging markets such as artificial intelligence (AI), genomics, and many others.\n\nBuffett, who long averted investments in the technology sector, shocked the world back in 2016 after taking a sizable position in Apple. The iPhone maker has rewarded Buffett handsomely, and now comprises nearly 50% of his Berkshire Hathaway portfolio.\n\nWhile Buffett owns a finite number of stocks in the technology sector, there is one AI company in particular that he shares with Wood. E-commerce and cloud computing leader Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) are both held in Berkshire Hathaway and Wood's exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nInvesting along the lines of Buffett and Wood puts investors in some pretty good company. Let's dig into Amazon stock and assess if now is a good opportunity to scoop up some shares.\n\nHow is Amazon disrupting AI?\n\nTo be clear, Wood and Buffett have each owned Amazon for several years -- well before all the hype surrounding AI came about. Nevertheless, interest in artificial intelligence (AI) fueled tech stocks in particular last year and largely contributed to meaningful gains in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite.\n\nWhen it comes to AI, it seems like the majority of the chatter is garnered by Microsoft-backed ChatGPT. In addition, demand for semiconductors used to train generative AI models has resulted in a lot of attention around Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices in particular. While it's easy to become captivated by these exciting developments, investors should remember that there are many other players quietly making inroads in AI.\n\nFor Amazon, the company's multibillion-dollar investment in an AI start-up called Anthropic could carry some lucrative tailwinds. As part of the deal, Anthropic will be using Amazon as its primary cloud provider. Over the last year, a sluggish macroeconomy has significantly impacted Amazon's cloud growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, the new partnership with Anthropic could be an opportunity to return to accelerated growth. Furthermore, Amazon's new managed service, called Bedrock, is already experiencing positive momentum as applications leveraging large language models (LLMs), among other tools, become more of a fixture for corporate IT budgets. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSome things to keep in mind\n\nWhen it comes to owning Amazon, there is something deeper that Wood and Buffett both share: The stock is an extremely nominal holding for them. For Wood, Amazon comprises just 0.06% of her total portfolio. Furthermore, the e-commerce giant represents a mere 0.40% of Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nIt's important for investors to understand that following the moves of larger, more prominent funds is not a guarantee for success. Although institutional support can be viewed as a positive, investors should not take a position in a certain stock or asset just because a notable money manager did so.\n\nAmazon stock looks like a bargain AMZN PS Ratio Chart\n\nThe chart illustrates the price-to-sales (P/S) multiple for Amazon benchmarked against a cohort of other megacap tech enterprises. At a P/S of just 2.9, Amazon is the least expensive stock in the \"Magnificent Seven\" based on this metric. Interestingly, this P/S level is also very much in line with Amazon's 10-year average of 3.1.\n\nI find this intriguing because over the last decade, Amazon has achieved quite a bit. The company is an undisputed leader among cloud providers, fending off stiff competition from the likes of Microsoft, Alphabet, and Oracle. Moreover, Amazon has entered several other end markets, including streaming and advertising. Now, with artificial intelligence being at the center of the next evolution of Amazon Web Services, the company's return to accelerated revenue and free cash flow looks very much in sight.\n\nI think investors are broadly miscalculating -- perhaps underappreciating -- Amazon's potential within the AI landscape, and as such are discounting the stock relative to its peers. In turn, investors have been presented with a unique opportunity to buy shares at an attractive valuation. Now looks like a great time to employ a dollar-cost averaging strategy and begin building a long-term position in Amazon stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Amazon wasn't one of them.

Artificial intelligence is set to be a major focus in the latest quarterly reports from tech behemoths Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) later today. Boeing (NYSE:BA) scraps an application to speed up the official certification of its upcoming 737 Max 7 jet following heavy scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers.\n\n1. Futures subdued\n\nU.S. stock futures were subdued on Tuesday, as investors awaited the release of fresh earnings from several big-name companies, a bevy of key economic data, and a major Federal Reserve policy decision.\n\nBy 05:30 ET (10:30 GMT), the Dow futures contract had shed 44 points or 0.1%, S&P 500 futures had fallen by 2 points or 0.1%, and Nasdaq 100 futures were mostly flat.\n\nThe main averages on Wall Street climbed in the prior session, with the benchmark S&P 500 in particular surging by 0.8% to a fresh record high close. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite jumped by 1.12% and the 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.6%.\n\nIn individual stocks, shares in iRobot (NASDAQ:IRBT) slumped by 8.8% after the robot vacuum maker and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) announced they had mutually agreed to terminate a planned merger due to opposition from EU antitrust regulators. Elsewhere, SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ:SOFI) soared by 20.2% after the online personal finance group posted better-than-anticipated quarterly profit.\n\n2. Microsoft, Alphabet earnings ahead\n\nTech giant Microsoft and Google-parent Alphabet are set to unveil their latest quarterly earnings after the close of trading in New York on Tuesday, in the first wave of potentially market-moving corporate results this week.\n\nFor Microsoft, the figures come after the Redmond, Washington-based company's stock market value topped $3 trillion for the first time ever last week.\n\nUndergirding this sky-high valuation is Microsoft's investment in OpenAI, whose ChatGPT chatbot has become one of the focal points of recent growing enthusiasm over generative artificial intelligence. Analysts will likely be paying close attention to any comments from the firm's executives regarding how they hope to deploy the nascent technology, particularly at its crucial Azure cloud computing division.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet, meanwhile, has recently launched its own advanced AI play, dubbed Gemini. The YouTube-owner has lauded this model as a sophisticated tool for crunching disparate pieces of information like video, text, and audio, with Chief Executive Sundar Pichai calling it \"one of the biggest science and engineering efforts we've undertaken.\"\n\nAI will also be front-and-center for Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) when the chipmaker posts results after the bell later today. Analysts already hiked their price target for the semiconductor group earlier this month, citing the benefits of elevated demand for AI-powered chips.\n\n3. Boeing withdraws request for 737 Max 7 safety exemption\n\nBoeing has confirmed that it is withdrawing its request for a safety exemption for a new series of its popular 737 Max planes, as the jetmaker wrangles with the continuing fallout from a dangerous mid-air door plug breach earlier this month.\n\nThe exemption would have allowed U.S. regulators to expedite the process of approving Boeing's upcoming 737 Max 7. Investors had widely anticipated that it would receive the official green light in the first half of this year.\n\nMore doubt now surrounds the timeline for the much-anticipated certification of both the Max 7 and Boeing's larger Max 10. According to Reuters, the company may be forced to roll out design changes more quickly than it had originally planned.\n\nBoeing's decision also comes after it faced heavy pressure from U.S. lawmakers last week to withdraw its application for the exemption. U.S. Senator and aviation subcommittee chair Tammy Duckworth took a particularly strong stance against the request, arguing that it could have \"catastrophic consequences on passenger safety.\"\n\n4. BYD shares slip after disappointing profit forecast\n\nBYD (SZ:002594), the Warren Buffett-backed group that recently dethroned Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) as the world's biggest electric vehicle (EV) maker by sales volume, has forecast full-year profit that missed analyst expectations, sending shares lower on Tuesday.\n\nThe Chinese EV company said it now expects to report annual profit of between 29 billion yuan and 31 billion yuan, implying a rise of as much as 86.49% versus the prior year. However, the pace would be far slower than its 2022 net earnings growth of 446%.\n\nAnalysts at Nomura noted that the outlook was 4% to 10% below their projections, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing a research note.\n\nBYD flagged that it was facing \"fierce competition\" in China's EV industry, which has contributed to an intensifying price war among domestic automakers desperate to entice cost-wary consumers. Even still, the Shenzhen-based company said it has demonstrated \"strong resilience\" to these pressures, adding that it has been boosted by \"rapid\" expansion in overseas sales and expense reductions in its supply chain.\n\n5. Crude inches up amid Middle East tensions\n\nOil prices inched up on Tuesday after the previous session\u2019s losses, as escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East fueled supply concerns.\n\nBy 05:01 ET, the U.S. crude futures contract traded 0.5% higher at $77.13 a barrel, while the Brent contract climbed by $82.15 per barrel.\n\nCrude markets are on edge after the U.S. vowed to take \"all necessary actions\" to defend its troops following a deadly drone attack in Jordan by Iran-backed militants, potentially resulting in regional energy supply disruptions in the oil-rich Middle East.\n\nThe crude contracts fell over $1 on Monday as a deepening real estate crisis contributed to worries about demand from China, the world's biggest crude consumer.\n\nUpgrade your investing with our groundbreaking, AI-powered InvestingPro+ stock picks.

Axios announced last Friday (Jan. 26) it\u2019s launching a new division called Axios Entertainment, where it will develop and produce nonfiction programming, in both series and films. The move is a \u201cnatural next step\u201d for the company according to its CEO Jim VandeHei. Its first video project is being done in partnership with Amazon (AMZN) and will stream on Prime Video.\n\nThe new entertainment division will be led by Axio\u2019s head of development, Erica Winograd, who has developed video programming for other media organizations, including Refinery29 and Vox Media.\n\nAxios\u2019 first foray into the entertainment sphere was through a television series deal with HBO in 2018 and\u00a0 lasted for four seasons. Titled Axios, the show focused on interview-style reporting, featuring business executives like Google CEO Sundar Pichai and topical politicians like President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. HBO canceled the show in 2021, shortly before it won an Emmy that year. According to reporting from Puck News, HBO executives had \u201clost their appetite for news programing\u201d and were focusing on developing HBO\u2019s own streaming business.\n\nAxios\u2019s new venture features a roster of collaborations with celebrity production companies, including Tom Brady\u2019s Shadow Lion and Chrissy Teigen\u2019s Huntley Productions.\n\n\u201cEntertainment programming is a natural next step for Axios, using engaging documentary storytelling to make audiences smarter, faster about the ever-changing world around them,\u201d CEO VandeHei, who is also the cofounder of Axios, said in a statement on Jan. 26.\n\nVandeHei founded Axios in 2016 with Mike Allen and Roy Schwartz. All three were journalists for Politico, of which VandeHei is a cofounder. VandeHei has said he envisioned Axios to be a mix between The Economist and Twitter by delivering well-reported news in an efficient format for readers. Allen reports for Axios and writes its daily Axios AM and Axios PM newsletters. Schwartz is CEO of Axios HQ, an artificial intelligence software program that assists companies with their internal communications efforts.\n\nStory continues\n\nAxios was bought out by Cox Enterprises in 2022 for $525 million, a deal that also helped the company further access the local journalism market.

More than 70% of Prime orders arrived same day or the next across the Atlantic in the U.K.\n\nOverall, Amazon said it delivered 7 billion items with same or next day shipping last year. The company declined to provide comparable figures on shipping data from 2022.\n\nThe e-commerce giant has credited speedier deliveries to improvements in inventory management and growth in its same-day delivery sites. The company currently has 55 of these sites in metro areas across the U.S. with plans to add more in the coming years.\n\nFaster shipping is also being driven by a new operations network, which splits the country up into smaller regions and ships items from those areas. The new model \u2013 which follows a pandemic boom in the company\u2019s logistics footprint and subsequent cutbacks - also helps Amazon cut down on costs since packages travel a shorter distance and have fewer touchpoints.\n\nSarah Matthew, Amazon\u2019s vice president for delivery experience, said in an interview that the online retailer is continuously analyzing its regions \u2013 including the buildings and inventories within them - and plans to refine it to better serve customers.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut despite Amazon\u2019s focus on speed, some rural Prime customers have complained about slower delivery speeds.\n\nThe company relies on independent contractors as well as carriers like UPS to ship orders to customers. It\u2019s also been recruiting small businesses that can help it deliver directly to hard-to-reach rural areas.\n\nWhen asked about rural deliveries, Matthew said the company is paying attention to anecdotal customer experiences but doesn\u2019t see a \u201cgeneral trend\u201d showing a slowdown.\n\nAmazon\u2019s focus on speed has put it in the crosshairs of labor advocates, who argue the company\u2019s fast-paced warehouses lead to more injuries among warehouse workers. The company's latest data from 2022 shows the rate of injuries or illness that occurred among Amazon\u2019s U.S. workforce fell that year. But it was still higher than it was in 2020.\n\nLast year, Amazon began testing a robotic storage system called Sequoia, which puts inventory into totes and presents it to employees so they don\u2019t have to bend or stretch as much. The company says the robot also reduces the time it takes to process an order by 25%.\n\nAmazon is planning to roll out Sequoia to more warehouses this year.

With the emergence of generative AI, investors can continue to benefit from the tailwinds of cloud computing infrastructure. As a central component for businesses, cloud computing will continue to play a significant role in how data is shared, stored, and scaled at large.\u00a0This is made cloud computing stocks to buy very desirable.\n\nThe demand for cloud services is stronger than ever, with particular companies holding market share dominance. If you\u2019re seeking growth opportunities that have the potential to outperform the market, then you should look no further than this industry.\n\nNow, let\u2019s explore the three best cloud computing stocks 2024!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOracle (ORCL) The Oracle (ORCL) sign hangs on an Oracle office in Deerfield, Illinois.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nOracle (NYSE:ORCL) makes a strong case as the best cloud computing stocks to buy in January 2024. Oracle\u2019s industry leading cloud computing platform has seen an acceleration in demand, largely driven by generative AI offerings. Furthermore, the company is in the midst of a huge data center expansion in the cloud infrastructure market.\n\nThe advent of artificial intelligence has created a new outlook for the cloud computing market. This is particularly evident for Oracle, as they are one of the leading cloud computing companies in the world. Oracle currently holds approximately 8% market share in the cloud infrastructure market, and generative AI is set to be a huge business driver moving forward. In Q2 FY24, Oracle\u2019s revenue grew 5% YOY to $12.9 billion.\n\nCloud revenue grew 25% to $4.8 billion, with cloud infrastructure revenue up 52%. CTO Larry Ellison is bullish on their ability to build and scale new data centers both rapidly and inexpensively. With Oracle\u2019s cloud businesses at a $20 billion run rate, now is a great time to snap up shares in January 2024.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Image of corporate building with Microsoft logo above the entrance.\n\nSource: NYCStock / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock just recently crossed the $3 trillion market cap status. Wall Street is becoming increasingly bullish on its generative AI prospects, as Azure cloud deployment starts to ramp up in FY24. Microsoft Azure, is one of the leading cloud computing companies in the world, used by more than 95% of Fortune 500 companies.\n\nThe 2024 fiscal year will be a significant transition year for Microsoft, as they begin to ramp up their generative AI offerings. There are a number of different catalysts to look forward to, including Microsoft\u2019s copilot software. This software is going to be a game changer for its Azure cloud customers, increasing both workloads and productivity at scale. They will be able to leverage LLMs to scale generative AI applications and operate Azure services with improved cost-structure and security.\n\nMicrosoft has been gradually increasing CAPEX to meet the growing demands of generative AI services, with cloud revenue seeing strong double digit growth. In Q1 FY24, revenue in the intelligence cloud surged 19% YOY to $24.3 billion. Integration across its entire tech stack is just beginning, and its early bets on AI are already paying dividends.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) amazon (AMZN) sign with dark background\n\nSource: Eric Broder Van Dyke / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) should need no introduction when considering the best cloud computing stocks to buy. Their wholly owned subsidiary, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is the largest cloud services company in the world. They hold nearly a one-third market share in cloud infrastructure services.\n\nAmazon is about to close off a strong 2023 fiscal year, and 2024 should prove to be another transformative year. Generative AI tailwinds continue to show promising signs of growth ahead, as demand skyrockets for its AWS customer base. Throughout 2023, Amazon has implemented significant cost-cutting measures in order to strengthen their position in the AI race. Restructuring efforts have proven to be material, as revenue, EPS, and operating income have risen to the occasion.\n\nAdditionally, AWS revenue is trending in the right direction and growth is likely to accelerate over the next decade. In Q3 2023, AWS revenue increased 12% YOY to $23.1 billion. Generative AI offerings have been the primary driver, and investors should expect growth to continue in FY24.\n\nOn the date of publication, Terel Miles did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

For example, the company reported 20% year-over-year revenue growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Growth in remaining performance obligations outpaced revenue growth which is a good sign for future revenue figures.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNet income surged by 871% year-over-year. Continued net income growth can make the company\u2019s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio far more appealing.

China's largest property developer Evergrande facing liquidation after courts deemed the company incapable of delivering on restructuring plans. Shares of US-listed Chinese companies being dragged down as well in today's trade.\n\nSo that was the headline on Evergrande here. So ordered, Julie, to liquidate by this Hong Kong court. Of course, the one time China's biggest property developer by sales. And kind of brings up this really broader question we've asked different strategists about, which is, do you want to put money to work in China? Now is there opportunity there? Or at this point, do you see sort of a giant value trap?\n\n- Well-- and this story is particularly interesting for foreign investors in the-- in China because how the court handles this liquidation is relevant to foreign holders of some of those assets. And so foreign investors are going to be watching this very quickly as well.\n\nBut what strikes me as we looked at those other China stocks is it's been a pretty uneven reaction. You know, yes, some of those stocks have been down sharply. But then like an Alibaba, which is an enormous Chinese company, it's not down that much. PDD, Pinduoduo, is up-- is down quite a bit here. And we were trying to sort of figure out what was going on.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere's one analyst over at Citi who says maybe it is some of the chatter around potential import tariffs on Chinese companies. Pinduoduo owns Temu, which has been increasing its business in the United States. It's a-- an e-tailer. So maybe that's part of what's going on. If there is another Trump presidency, we could see that kind of a tariff put in place. That's something he's talked about at least.\n\n- Yeah, I mean, we've had-- recently, we've had market strategists use very strong language about whether you want to put money there, right? I mean, they've used--\n\n- Yeah.\n\n- --words like uninvestable. Now we did hear from-- there was another side that we heard from Dan--\n\n- Yes.\n\n- --Niles last week, which I thought was really interesting as Dan is well-known, well-respected tech Investor. He took the other side of that trade and basically said, listen, if you think China's economy is going to zero, it's uninvestable.\n\n- Right.\n\n- But when he looks at some of these names that we're talking about here like Baidu or Tencent, Alibaba, he sees revenues climbing but stocks falling. So he said that, you know, the question for him isn't whether it's uninvestable. The question for him is basically, you just have to ask yourself an investor, do you think you're being paid to take risk to move--\n\n- Well-- and the other question you have to ask is how much volatility do you have the stomach for in the meantime while you're waiting to get paid potentially. So that's definitely part of the--\n\n- For sure.\n\n- --part of the factor as well. Let's talk about shares of Lucid as well. Those shares spiking higher after Motley Fool issued a buy alert on the EV maker saying that Lucid's valuation could see a substantial rebound. And the shares, a significant gain above current levels.\n\nListen, we got to couch this. Stuff doesn't always fool-- move on Motley Fool calls, right? And the call did say that this is an exceedingly slim bet that the stock could skyrocket here and go to even 70% of Tesla's value. So it was not a full throated buy recommendation here. But the reaction in the stock has been kind of incredible.\n\n- Yeah, I mean, even with today's pop, it's still down about 25% this year and about 70% over the past 12 months. I mean, what interests me about Lucid-- and it's also can throw in Rivian. You can throw in Tesla. Like, I think everybody is still trying to decide what this EV market broadly looks like this year, what does demand actually look like. And if you just read Tesla's print and listed Tesla's call, I don't think investors took a lot of--\n\n- Yeah.\n\n- --comfort about what that market actually looks like.\n\n- Well, the other big thing to consider here is whenever I see a pop like this, you know where I go. I go to look up short interest. And according to Bloomberg data, 29% of the float of Lucid shares is shorted. That is an extraordinarily high number.\n\n- Yeah.\n\n- So what happens in that case is you see a little bit of buying. And then people who have short the stock close out the shorts. That then exacerbates the buying, pushes it up even more, which is probably at least part of what's going on here today.\n\n- And finally, let's get to the last one here, another day, another deal down the drain. Shares of iRobot, they're down big today as Amazon announces it will not move forward with its acquisition of the vacuum makers. They see no path for regulatory approval. So Amazon, Julie, officially drops the planned acquisition of iRobot, the Roomba maker.\n\nAnd of course, we knew regulators. And we talked about this. The EU weren't happy with this deal. And then it sounds like the vacuum makers quickly taken these steps-- CEO stepping down, cutting jobs. It looks like about 350 jobs, about 30% of the workforce.\n\nFor Amazon, you know, listen, they have the resources to keep building out this kind of footprint in smart home devices. But it does speak to kind of broader issues of the regulatory backdrop we've seen here.\n\n- Yeah, I mean, this is another one that was going on for a while. They first proposed this deal back in August of--\n\n- Yeah.\n\n- --2022. And it's taken until now for them to finally say, forget about it, we're done. They are going to be paying a termination fee to iRobot of $94 million. But to your point, iRobot on its own has been struggling here. And actually, Amazon had cut the purchase price last year for iRobot before now taking this step of abandoning the deal entirely.\n\nSo maybe on some level, Amazon feels like the regulators have done it a favor since it was going to take on what had become sort of a struggling asset. But to your point, it does speak to the broader regulatory environment here. It looked like in the EU, maybe they would have accepted some concessions from Amazon. But Amazon got to a point where they didn't want to do the back and forth anymore, it seems.\n\n- Yeah.\n\n- Yeah.\n\n- We have just the man to talk more about this.\n\n- Yes, we do.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/video/evergrande-lucid-amazon-irobot-trending-211359613.html", "symbols": ["0R1O.IL", "3333.HK", "9PDA.F", "9PDA.STU", "AMZ.F", "AMZ.XETRA", "AMZN.MI", "AMZN.MX", "AMZN.US", "AMZO34.SA", "EV1.F", "I8R.BE", "I8R.F", "I8R.MU", "I8R.STU", "I8R.XETRA", "IRBT.US", "LCID.US", "P1DD34.SA", "PDD.US"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.999, "neg": 0.044, "neu": 0.826, "pos": 0.129}}, {"date": "2024-01-29T21:03:52+00:00", "title": "M&amp;A activity outlook for 2024 after termination of big deals", "content": "Amazon (AMZN) is terminating its pursuit of acquiring iRobot (IRBT), while JetBlue Airways (JBLU) calls off its merger with discount operator Spirit Airlines (SAVE).

This sector is at the heart of today\u2019s digital economy, driven by the surge in cloud computing, data consumption, and the Internet of Things. Equinix\u2019s strategic role in this ecosystem is underscored by its partnerships with tech leaders like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), making it an attractive option for investors looking to indirectly engage with the tech sector\u2019s growth.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nInvesting in real estate just got a whole lot simpler. This Dara Khosrowshahi-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100. Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, but few investors have the capital or resources needed to invest in this asset class. A platform backed by industry giant Marcus & Millichap is changing that, allowing individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000.\n\nThis relationship not only enhances Equinix\u2019s investment allure but also provides a unique avenue to benefit from the tech industry\u2019s dynamism and expansion, similar to receiving dividends from the growth trajectories of Microsoft and AWS. Investors often grapple with the dilemma of choosing between growth and income; growth-centric investments typically lack regular income streams, while high-dividend yields are seldom associated with significant growth opportunities. Equinix, however, disrupts this paradigm. By facilitating the critical infrastructure needed by cloud and tech companies, Equinix firmly anchors itself within a sector experiencing exponential growth. Moreover, as a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT), Equinix is obligated to distribute the majority of its taxable income to shareholders as dividends.\n\nThe company\u2019s business model, focusing on providing essential infrastructure for digital and cloud services, aligns well with the ongoing shift towards online services and data-driven decision-making in businesses worldwide. As a REIT, Equinix combines growth potential with the obligation to return most of its taxable income to shareholders in the form of dividends, offering a balanced investment opportunity.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith a global network of data centers located in key markets, Equinix benefits from a diverse and stable client base, reducing exposure to regional economic shifts. This international footprint ensures consistent demand for its services, supporting long-term growth and dividend sustainability. In the third quarter of 2023, Equinix declared a dividend of $3.41 per share, with total dividends paid from January to September 2023 reaching $10.23.\n\nInvesting in Equinix transcends mere participation in the real estate market; it offers a gateway to indirectly reap the benefits of the tech sector\u2019s success. As digital transformation progresses, propelled by evolving consumer demands and technological innovation, Equinix\u2019s role in this ecosystem is poised to become increasingly crucial, potentially bolstering its dividend outlook. This connection furnishes a persuasive argument for investors to consider Equinix as a means to diversify their portfolio and tap into the thriving tech and cloud computing domains.\n\nRead Next:\n\nCommercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, but few investors have the capital or resources needed to invest in this asset class.

Amazon added that by blocking the deal the EU would make it harder for a smaller company like iRobot to create new products and sell them at lower prices.\n\n\u201cMergers and acquisitions like this help companies like iRobot better compete in the global marketplace, particularly against companies, and from countries, that aren\u2019t subject to the same regulatory requirements in fast-moving technology segments like robotics,\u201d Amazon senior vice president and general counsel David Zapolsky said in a press release. \u201cUndue and disproportionate regulatory hurdles discourage entrepreneurs, who should be able to see acquisition as one path to success, and that hurts both consumers and competition\u2014the very things that regulators say they\u2019re trying to protect.\u201d\n\nAmazon will pay iRobot a $94 million termination fee as a result of the deal\u2019s collapse, according to the Wall Street Journal. iRobot also announced it would lay off about 31% of its employees.\n\nThe EU cracks down on U.S. Big Tech\n\nThis isn\u2019t Amazon or U.S. Big Tech\u2019s first run-in with European regulators\u2014in recent years the continent has taken a more active approach in curtailing the expansion of the industry\u2019s most dominant companies.\n\nMany of the industry\u2019s major players\u2014such as Apple, Google, and Amazon\u2014have come under scrutiny from top competition watchdog Margrethe Vestager for the outsize influence they wield in online marketplaces and the digital advertising business.\n\nTo go along with its newly exacting approach to individual companies, the EU also passed two sweeping pieces of legislation last year that were among the most robust in curbing tech\u2019s influence. The Digital Services Act, meant to rein in the influence of powerful tech companies, gave Amazon a special designation of \u201cvery large online platform\u201d that imposed added restrictions on which type of data it could use to target digital advertising. Along with the DSA came the Digital Markets Act, which governs online marketplaces, and which designated Amazon a \u201cgatekeeper\u201d and banned it from giving its own services preferential treatment when recommending products.\n\nStory continues\n\nAn Amazon spokesperson told Fortune the DSA was meant to regulate large digital advertisers, while the majority of the company\u2019s revenue comes from online retail sales. The spokesperson also noted that Amazon is not the largest retailer in any of the countries in which it operates, and said those unnamed retailers weren\u2019t added to the list. Regarding the DMA, the spokesperson said Amazon will \u201ccontinue to work constructively with the European Commission as we finalize our implementation plans.\u201d\n\nA deal that seemed unlikely from the start\n\nAmazon\u2019s proposed iRobot acquisition was in danger from the outset, with the EU formally launching an investigation in July. EU regulators expressed worries that after acquiring iRobot, Amazon might use its position as an online marketplace to harm other third-party sellers of remote vacuums that compete with the Roomba. It was also concerned that Amazon might unfairly restrict access for competitors to the Amazon Alexa interface that can be used to control a Roomba by issuing voice commands.\n\nBy the end of November, the EU had formally notified Amazon of its investigation\u2019s findings. At the time, the European Commission communicated to Amazon that it would make a formal decision by Feb. 14, although that deadline is now moot, with the two companies voluntarily ending the agreement.\n\nMost of the EC\u2019s crackdown on Big Tech is spearheaded by Vestager, the European commissioner for competition. In 2022, Vestager\u2019s office reached a settlement with Amazon that forced the company to make changes to its business after previously allowing it to operate as both a seller and a marketplace, giving it an unfair advantage over other vendors on the site, according to regulators. Of particular concern at the time was use of nonpublic data collected from sellers using the platform that Amazon then used to gain a leg up on these merchants. As a result of the settlement Amazon avoided having to pay a fine.\n\nIn the past several years, Vestager and the EC have levied huge fines against tech\u2019s biggest players. Google parent Alphabet was hit with a total of $9 billion in fines since 2017, including a single fine of about $5 billion, its largest ever penalty. The EC also scrutinized Facebook and WhatsApp owner Meta, for its role in facilitating online sales, arguing that tying access to its classified section, Facebook Marketplace, to a Facebook account, while also offering unfavorable digital ad rates to competitors, violated antitrust law. Meanwhile, Apple overhauled its App Store to comply with new EU regulations that would have otherwise risked seeing it banned from the continent entirely. \r\nEarlier this month Vestager came to the U.S. to visit several tech companies, including Alphabet and Apple.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-failed-irobot-deal-european-200115491.html", "symbols": ["AMZ.F", "AMZ.XETRA", "AMZN.MX", "AMZN.US", "AMZO34.SA", "I8R.BE", "I8R.F", "I8R.MU", "I8R.STU", "IRBT.US"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.96, "neg": 0.067, "neu": 0.831, "pos": 0.103}}, {"date": "2024-01-29T19:07:26+00:00", "title": "Alphabet, Meta ad sales in Q4 unlikely to reflect gen AI investments", "content": "By Sheila Dang\n\nAUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - Despite the buzz over generative artificial intelligence last year, the technology's impact on the advertising business of Alphabet and Meta Platforms is likely to be muted when the companies report fourth-quarter results this week, though investors are mapping out its future potential.\n\nThe search giant has rolled out AI tools that help advertisers target audiences in a less costly way and decide how their marketing budgets should be distributed across Google's ad network. Facebook parent Meta is using generative AI to create different variations of ad campaigns.\n\nGenerative AI, which can create text and photos from prompts, is still in the \"hype cycle,\" Bernstein analysts said in a research note earlier this month, but added that investors were now looking for \"incremental use cases and revenue streams to spawn from these recent advancements.\"\n\nThe core business of digital advertising is expected to have been resilient in the quarter ended Dec. 31, and warnings that economic and geopolitical uncertainty could dampen the ad market are likely to prove overblown, the brokerage said in a separate note last week.\n\nMicrosoft, which is scheduled to report quarterly results on Tuesday, is likely to be the earliest winner in the nascent generative AI race, which has consumed nearly every tech and social media company from Amazon.com to Snap. For Microsoft, generative AI has fueled demand for its cloud services.\n\nAlphabet stock surged 58% last year, while Meta's stock nearly tripled. The broader S&P 500 index gained roughly a quarter in 2023, helped by an AI-fueled tech rally.\n\nGoing into 2024, \"an additional catalyst ... other than AI, will be the big focus on political advertising and will boost businesses at Meta and Google,\" said D.A. Davidson and Co analyst Gil Luria.\n\nSpending on political advertising in the U.S. will jump 30% this year from the last presidential election in 2020, partly driven by higher spending on digital platforms, research firm Insider Intelligence has estimated.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn Tuesday, Google parent Alphabet is expected to report that fourth-quarter advertising revenue - its mainstay - grew 11.8% to $66 billion, according to LSEG data.\n\nGoogle introduced its experimental AI chatbot Bard early last year and launched what it calls a search generative experience (SGE) that generates written responses to some Google Search queries.\n\nIt rolled out SGE to 120 countries in November, but the new search experience could have very little impact on its business in the near-term.\n\nBy 2025, SGE could account for between $35.6 million and $113 million in incremental search advertising revenue in the \"upside scenarios,\" said New Street Research analysts in a research report in October, adding that the biggest factor depends on how often people click on ads shown in AI-generated responses.\n\nAI POTENTIAL\n\nMeta, the second-largest digital ad platform, has already proven that its work in AI can produce results for its advertisers.\n\nIn a survey of advertisers who tested Meta's AI tools that can generate images and backgrounds for ads, half said they estimated the tools could save them at least five hours of work per week, Bernstein analysts said.\n\nAfter cautioning in October that the Israel-Hamas conflict could hurt ad spending, analysts estimate Meta will report $39.1 billion in fourth-quarter revenue on Thursday, at the higher end of Meta's guidance.\n\nA suite of AI tools that automatically finds potential customers and tests which ads will perform best is earning $10 billion on an annualized basis, Meta has said.\n\nIf the company introduces paid ads later this year within the AI assistants it recently launched to answer questions inside WhatsApp, Messenger and Instagram, it could generate $6.7 billion in ad revenue in 2025, New Street Research estimated.\n\nSuch ads could also be a much-needed boon for Snap, owner of photo messaging app Snapchat, which partnered with Microsoft in September to place sponsored product links in its chatbot called My AI.\n\nNew Street Research estimated Snap will earn $234 million this year from these links, which will grow to $686 million in 2025, or more than 11% of annual revenue. Analysts estimate Snap will report fourth-quarter revenue of $1.4 billion, up 5.7% from the previous year.\n\nAmazon.com, which will begin showing ads on its Prime Video service this week, is building partnerships for Amazon Bedrock, a service that lets businesses create applications with a range of AI models, RBC Capital Markets said.\n\nThe launch of Prime Video ads could boost Amazon's ad revenue growth by 5% to 10%, RBC Capital Markets said in its 2024 outlook report. The retail giant reports results on Thursday.\n\n(Reporting by Sheila Dang in Austin, Texas; Additional reporting by Yuvraj Malik in Bengaluru; Editing by Sayantani Ghosh and Matthew Lewis)", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alphabet-meta-ad-sales-q4-190726485.html", "symbols": ["1SI.F", "1SI.STU", "1SI.XETRA", "ABEA.F", "ABEA.XETRA", "ABEC.F", "ABEC.XETRA", "AMZ.F", "AMZ.XETRA", "AMZN.MX", "AMZN.US", "AMZO34.SA", "FB2A.F", "FB2A.XETRA", "GOGL34.SA", "GOGL35.SA", "GOOG.MX", "GOOG.US", "GOOGL.US", "MSF.F"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.985, "neg": 0.02, "neu": 0.92, "pos": 0.06}}, {"date": "2024-01-29T19:07:00+00:00", "title": "Amazon (AMZN) to Post Q4 Earnings: What's in the Offing?", "content": "Amazon AMZN is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2023 results on Feb 1.\r\n\r\nFor the fourth quarter, the company expects net sales between $160 billion and $167 billion, which represents 7-12% year-over-year growth.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sales is pegged at $166.26 billion, indicating growth of 11.4% from the prior-year quarter\u2019s reported figure.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at 81 cents per share, which indicates a massive jump from 21 cents reported in the year-ago quarter.

It witnessed record-breaking sales on Black Friday and Cyber Monday.\r\n\r\nAmazon\u2019s expanding distribution network, Prime-enabled fast delivery, including Prime Free One Day and Prime Free Same-Day Delivery services and robust grocery services are expected to have aided the performance of its online retail business in the fourth quarter.\r\n\r\nThe company\u2019s growing worldwide e-commerce business, along with the expanding global footprint of Prime, is expected to have contributed well.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for online store sales is pegged at $68.53 billion, indicating growth of 6.2% from the year-ago reported figure.\r\n\r\nAmazon\u2019s aggressive stance on bolstering its physical presence is expected to have benefited the quarterly performance.\r\n\r\nGrowing momentum across Amazon Fresh grocery stores, Whole Foods stores and Amazon Go outlets across the United States is anticipated to have contributed well to the company\u2019s sales in the fourth quarter.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for the fourth quarter\u2019s physical store sales is pegged at $5.31 billion, indicating growth of 7% from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nIn addition, strengthening relationships with third-party sellers might have remained a positive. The consensus mark for sales generated by third-party sellers is pegged at $41.5 billion, indicating growth of 14.1% from the figure reported in the prior-year quarter.\r\n\r\nComing to streaming services, solid momentum across Prime Video is anticipated to have been a major tailwind in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. Expanding original content and overall content portfolios on Prime Video are likely to have accelerated Prime engagement.\r\n\r\nGains from the growing momentum across Amazon Music are expected to be reflected in the company\u2019s fourth-quarter results.\r\n\r\nPrime benefits in retail as well as in online streaming fields might have continued aiding Amazon\u2019s subscription revenue growth in the quarter under review.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for subscription service sales is pegged at $10.4 billion, suggesting growth of 13.2% from the year-ago reported figure.\n\nStory continues\n\nAWS Portfolio Strength to Consider\n\nThe company\u2019s expanding Amazon Web Services (\u201cAWS\u201d) portfolio is expected to have benefited the fourth quarter\u2019s performance.\r\n\r\nIn the quarter under review, AWS introduced a palm-based identity and a fully managed service called Amazon One Enterprise. The service offers accurate and secured enterprise access control through an easy-to-use biometric identification device.\r\n\r\nIt also unveiled a generative AI-powered chatbot, Amazon Q. The AI-powered assistant provides quick answers and helps in content creation and action-taking based on a customer's information repositories, code and enterprise systems.\r\n\r\nIt introduced four new capabilities for AWS Supply Chain - AWS Supply Chain Supply Planning, AWS Supply Chain N-Tier Visibility, AWS Supply Chain Sustainability and Amazon Q in AWS Supply Chain, designed to boost its existing data lake, demand planning and ML-powered insights.\r\n\r\nAWS\u2019 introduction of AWS Graviton4 and AWS Trainium2, its next-generation two-chip families, might have contributed well.\r\n\r\nThe company also announced the general availability of Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) Express One Zone, a new high-performance, single-zone Amazon S3 storage class.\r\n\r\nIt unveiled new Amazon SageMaker capabilities for scaling with models, including SageMaker HyperPod, SageMaker Inference, SageMaker Clarify and SageMaker Canvas.\r\n\r\nAll these efforts are expected to have helped AWS win customers. This, in turn, is expected to have boosted AWS\u2019s fourth-quarter revenues, whose consensus mark is pinned at $24.32 billion, up 13.8% from the year-ago reported figure.\n\nSmart Device Portfolio to Consider\n\nAmazon\u2019s robust Fire products family, portfolio of Echo smart speakers, Blink doorbells and eero products are expected to have continued benefiting its financial performance in the fourth quarter. Additionally, strengthening Alexa features is likely to have aided Amazon in delivering a better user experience, which, in turn, is expected to be reflected in the upcoming results.\r\n\r\nHowever, inflationary pressure, geopolitical tensions and foreign currency headwinds might have remained concerns.\n\nWhat Our Model Says\n\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Amazon this time around.

The decision effectively ended a ban on sports betting at a federal level in every state but Nevada and has sparked a rapid expansion in the industry.

James Warrington reports:\n\nThe telecoms giant is facing a class action lawsuit over claims it \u201csystematically\u201d overcharged around 3m customers \u2013 many of whom are elderly \u2013 on their landline bills.\n\nThe case, led by former Ofcom executive Justin Le Patourel, accuses BT of consistently increasing prices even as its own costs were falling.\n\nIf successful, affected customers could be owed damages of between \u00a3300 and \u00a3400.\n\nMr Le Patourel said: \u201cWe believe BT has been systematically overcharging millions of customers over many years, and those customers could be owed hundreds of pounds each.\u201d\n\nThe first trial, which covers around 1.5m customers, began in the Competition Appeals Tribunal today.\n\nThe trial is expected to last eight weeks, with a judgement before the end of the year.\n\nThe legal action is centred on a 2017 Ofcom ruling, which found BT had been overcharging landline customers since 2009.\n\nThe former monopoly agreed to cut bills by \u00a37 per month from April 2018, but did not compensate customers for past overcharging.\n\nThe first group in the class action lawsuit are \u201cvoice only\u201d customers who had a BT landline service between October 2015 and April 2018.\n\nOfcom has previously said that these customers were more likely to be old, on low incomes or vulnerable.\n\nThe second group of around 2m customers had a BT landline service alongside broadband between October 2015 and December 2023, bundling these services together into a single, discounted package.\n\nMr Le Patourel said the case was particularly urgent given the age of many of the claimants. More than half a million affected customers have already passed away, though their estates will be entitled to apply for compensation if the case is successful.\n\nA spokesman for BT said: \u201cWe take our responsibilities to customers very seriously and are dedicated to keeping our customers connected, while helping those who need it most. This claim relates to a technical landline pricing issue which was resolved by Ofcom in 2017.\n\n\u201cWe do not accept that our pricing was anti-competitive back then, and as such are committed to robustly defending our position at trial.\u201d A BT shop in London - Rasid Necati Aslim/Anadolu via Getty Images\n\n03:35 PM GMT\n\nHanding over\n\nThat\u2019s all from me today.

Clients pay $30 per user per month for access to the software.

IRobot, which has been struggling recently, said Chief Executive Officer Colin Angle has stepped down as the company embarks on a restructuring plan that will result in about 350 job cuts, or 31% of the workforce. The vacuum maker\u2019s shares tumbled 19% in New York to $13.80, their lowest level since 2009. Amazon\u2019s shares were up less than 1% at $160.07.\n\nThe decision is a sign of the intense pressure Amazon is facing to prove its actions don\u2019t harm competition as its influence grows in retail, cloud-computing and entertainment. Antitrust regulators on both sides of the Atlantic have been keen to ensure that the biggest US tech companies don\u2019t snap up innovative startups before they have a chance to become formidable competitors on their own.\n\nAmazon met with the FTC\u2019s senior antitrust staff last week, who informed the company they were recommending a suit over the deal, according to a person familiar with the meeting. Executives and lawyers from the tech giant were scheduled to meet with the FTC\u2019s three commissioners this week to make a final push for the acquisition, said the person, who asked not to be named discussing the confidential probe.\n\nThe European Commission, the EU\u2019s executive arm that oversees antitrust, is generally known to opt for remedies that correct any risks to fair competition rather than ban mergers outright. But companies often short-circuit the process by choosing to abandon deals that appear to be headed for a veto.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon\u2019s move, which comes with a $94 million termination fee to be paid to iRobot, follows a similar decision recently by Adobe Inc. to walk away from a planned $20 billion acquisition of startup Figma Inc. after locking horns with antitrust regulators in the EU and the UK.\n\nAmazon decided not to offer remedies to concerns flagged by regulators. The commission had earlier warned Amazon could be tempted to demote other robot vacuum cleaners on its platform and promote its own products with such labels as \u201cAmazon\u2019s choice\u201d or \u201cWorks With Alexa.\u201d The regulator also said Amazon may find it \u201ceconomically profitable\u201d to shut out rivals and had attempted to pressure Amazon into offering concessions in order to get the green light in Brussels, to no avail.\n\n\u201cThis outcome will deny consumers faster innovation and more competitive prices, which we\u2019re confident would have made their lives easier and more enjoyable,\u201d said David Zapolsky, Amazon senior vice president and general counsel, in a statement. \u201cUndue and disproportionate regulatory hurdles discourage entrepreneurs, who should be able to see acquisition as one path to success, and that hurts both consumers and competition\u2014the very things that regulators say they\u2019re trying to protect.\u201d\n\nWhile the company considered an appeal, that process was likely to take years, people familiar with the matter said, who asked not to be named discussing information that\u2019s not public. The merger agreement expires this summer and the companies had already renegotiated the terms once.\n\n\u201cFinancially, this deal is immaterial to either sales or profit of Amazon,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence senior analyst Poonam Goyal said in a note Monday. But broadly speaking, she said, the termination \u201csupports our view that large technology companies will have a tough time closing any acquisition given the current regulatory climates in the US and Europe.\u201d\n\nThe breakup also spares Amazon the task of stemming the losses incurred by Bedford, Massachusetts-based iRobot, which has seen its fortunes sour in recent years. Last year iRobot was forced to secure a $200 million financing facility, and Amazon cut its per-share offer by about 15%.\n\nIRobot\u2019s sales have fallen as pandemic-era home improvement splurges petered out. The company, which had been consistently profitable since its 2005 initial public offering, has racked up about $500 million in net losses since the second quarter of 2021. In a financial update on Monday, the company said it had an adjusted operating loss of about $200 million in 2023.\n\nRead More: Biden Antitrust Enforcers Set New Record for Merger Challenges\n\nAmazon, which builds the Alexa voice assistant and a wide range of home electronics, announced its intention to acquire iRobot in August 2022, a move that would have expanded its foothold in the burgeoning market for smart-home gadgets. The Seattle-based company has also developed its own home robotics franchise with Astro, a $1,600 home security bot it has started marketing as a business security guard.\n\nAmazon and iRobot have been close partners for years. The retailer has long been iRobot\u2019s biggest customer, at times accounting for more than a quarter of sales (iRobot in 2021 stopped disclosing the identity of its biggest customer, which, during the most recently reported quarter, accounted for about 22% of revenue.) The vacuum maker, meanwhile, is a customer of the Amazon Web Services cloud-computing group, and has dispatched executives to speak at Amazon events.\n\nThe opposition to Amazon\u2019s iRobot acquisition highlights the tension between Amazon\u2019s retail operations and its ambitions for the smart-home ecosystem built around its Alexa voice assistant. The FTC has also expressed concern that the deal would give Amazon too much control over the smart-home device market and potentially violate users\u2019 privacy by giving the company access to data on their homes.\n\nIn an apparent warning shot for Amazon\u2019s future acquisition plans, the European Commission said it would keep a close eye on deals where \u201cestablished sales channels acquire suppliers that are heavily dependent on the acquirer\u2019s infrastructure and customer reach to be successful.\u201d\n\nThough small for a company the size of Amazon, an iRobot acquisition would have been the fourth-biggest in its history, trailing only its purchases of Whole Foods Market, movie studio MGM and the One Medical concierge health-care service.\n\nRegulators in Europe and the US are increasingly skeptical of Big Tech\u2019s dealmaking. In September, the EU regulator nixed Booking Holdings Inc.\u2019s \u20ac1.6 billion ($1.7 billion) bid for Sweden\u2019s Etraveli Group and the bloc is in the very early stages of looking into Microsoft Corp.\u2019s partnership with OpenAI. In the US, the Biden administration set a record for merger challenges.\n\n(Updates with statement from European Commission)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThere\u2019s So Much Data Even Spies Are Struggling to Find Secrets Basketball, Basketball, Basketball: Inside Steve Ballmer\u2019s New $2 Billion Arena How a Lucky Break Fueled Eli Lilly\u2019s $600 Billion Weight-Loss Empire AI Needs So Much Power That Old Coal Plants Are Sticking Around How the West\u2019s Favorite Autocrat Engineered Africa\u2019s Most Dramatic Turnaround\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-drops-1-4-billion-135144552.html", "symbols": ["AMZ.F", "AMZ.XETRA", "AMZN.MX", "AMZN.US", "AMZO34.SA", "I8R.BE", "I8R.F", "I8R.MU", "I8R.STU", "IRBT.US"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.265, "neg": 0.071, "neu": 0.847, "pos": 0.082}}, {"date": "2024-01-29T16:49:31+00:00", "title": "US FTC was poised to reject Amazon acquisition of iRobot -- source", "content": "WASHINGTON, Jan 29 (Reuters) - The Federal Trade Commission was poised to reject Amazon.com's $1.4 billion acquisition of robot vacuum maker iRobot before the companies announced early Monday they were abandoning the deal in the face of EU antitrust opposition, a source said.\n\nThe FTC staff had met with Amazon last week to inform them they planned to recommend the commission vote to sue to block the acquisition, the source added, saying the commission was set to hold a final meeting on Monday with Amazon before the commission could have voted to approve a legal challenge to the merger.

Yet, the technology-laden benchmark is leading the way again a month into the new year. It\u2019s up over 3% so far in January, which would lead to another annual gain of about 45% if it maintained that pace!\n\nOf course, it\u2019s unrealistic to expect the market to keep growing like that. For example,\u00a0Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) just offered near-term guidance that cut the knees out of its stock, and other chipmakers sympathized. Semiconductor stocks had been among the best performers last year. You can expect continued volatility in the sector and other markets, too.\n\nEven so, while the index is still near its all-time highs, Nasdaq 100 tech bargains are available. What follows are the seven best opportunities to cash in on future growth.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNasdaq 100 Tech Bargains: Cisco Systems (CSCO) the cisco (CSCO) logo on a wall\n\nSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe reason Intel\u2019s guidance sucked was because companies are rushing headlong into artificial intelligence (AI) data center chips and away from standard processors. While Intel is late to the game, those same forces are exactly why Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) is taking off. Shares are up 10% over the past few months. I see that as only the beginning.\n\nCisco sees massive orders piling up for its AI-based Ethernet architecture that runs under the GPU architecture. CEO Chuck Robbins sees\u00a0$1 billion in order flow coming in fiscal year 2025, or twice as much as previously predicted. That\u2019s because that\u2019s when the Ethernet buildout will really take off. Cisco already has its Ethernet fabric deployed at three major hyperscalers. The world\u2019s four largest hyperscale platforms are Amazon\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS, Alphabet\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Cloud, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and Microsoft\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure. Together, they account for around 78% of total capacity.\n\nStory continues\n\nCisco also works with\u00a0Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), and even Intel to develop Ethernet technologies for GPU-enabled infrastructure. That makes the networking hardware leader part of this tightly-knit growth industry that shows no sign of letting up.\n\nFortinet (FTNT) The Fortinet logo on a wall\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe ongoing buildout of the cloud also means the data transitioning from brick-and-mortar data centers needs protection.\u00a0Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) is a leading provider of cybersecurity solutions for enterprises, service providers, and government organizations. And it\u2019s not just with the underlying architecture where AI plays a leading role. Next-generation data and app security driven by AI tools is in high demand. After two disappointing quarters, though, Fortinet is growing again.\n\nMuch of the cybersecurity specialist\u2019s business was centered around hardware-based firewalls monitoring traffic for physical data centers. As we said before, enterprise spending was moving to the cloud. But Fortinet has heavily invested in AI, and its secure access service edge (SASE) offerings are expanding. Fortinet says SASE is a $17 billion market\u00a0growing at a 20% compounded annual rate and is expected to hit $36 billion by 2027. It sees continued momentum of its SASE solutions that were adopted by internet providers, including AT&T (NYSE:T), British Telecom (OTCMKTS:BTGOF), Telefonica (NYSE:TEF), and others.\n\nFTNT stock is up 50% from the lows it hit after earnings, but more growth will come.\n\nNasdaq 100 Tech Bargains: Lam Research (LRCX) Lam Research sign and logo at semiconductor company Lam Research Corporation headquarters in Silicon Valley. LRCX Stock\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock\n\nThe pell-mell rush into AI chips also boosts\u00a0Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX), the premier manufacturer of specialized semiconductor equipment. Its etch and deposition tools allow for more sophisticated chips and advanced packaging techniques that AI requires. Etching is the selective removal of film and material from a wafer to create features customers want.\n\nThis is another tremendous growth opportunity because of\u00a0the new chip design technology under development. Called gate-all-around (GAA), manufacturers can have material on all four sides of a transistor instead of three. It could greatly increase chip speed and efficiency.\n\nLam Research sees it as alone being a $1 billion opportunity. As Lam is one of the few equipment manufacturers that could handle such an increase, it can reap the benefits. It is already\u00a0approaching a 75% market share in the space.\n\nSales and profits are growing, as its recently released earnings report indicated. Yet, trading at only 23 times next year\u2019s earnings estimates is a bargain stock to buy.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) is also cashing in on the demand for cybersecurity products. Unlike Fortinet, however, it has been hitting the mark each quarter. Its stock is up 115% over the last 12 months and is 16% higher so far this year. Sales and profits are on a rocket-ride higher with earnings increasing 10-fold year over year last quarter.\n\nDriving this performance is its\u00a0new AI-powered Cortex platform (I\u2019m sensing a theme with what makes a business successful these days). Cortex now has 5,300 customers, up 25%, and it was the first to achieve 100% detection and prevention from cyberattacks in industry-standard testing.\n\nWhat sets Palo Alto Networks apart from the crowded cybersecurity field is its agnostic approach to protection. It offers SASE products, cloud, on-site, hybrid protection solutions, next-gen firewalls, and more. By giving the customer what it wants, it has met the broadest needs of the market. With Wall Street expecting earnings to grow 22% annually for the next five years, Palo Alto Networks should record a sonic boom in growth.\n\nNasdaq 100 Tech Bargains: ASML Holding (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nLike Lam Research,\u00a0ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML) offers specialized semiconductor equipment for AI chip production. It differs from the competition because it has a monopoly on extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) machines. It is the world\u2019s only manufacturer of the machines needed by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), Intel, Samsung, and other chipmakers.\n\nThese machines are not exactly mass-produced either. It\u00a0built just 345 lithography systems last year, 81 immersion systems, and only 40 EUV machines. But what it lacks in volume, ASML makes up for in price. The EUV equipment, for example, goes for around $200 million a pop.\n\nYet ASML is in the process of further cementing its dominance by developing next-generation high-numerical aperture (high-NA) lithography systems. These will allow its customers to produce even smaller chips. They\u2019re also not bargain-basement priced. These next-gen machines sell for about $300 million each. It\u00a0shipped the first one to Intel in December.\n\nThat\u2019s why the stock is still undervalued despite ASML stock trading at an all-time high. It already enjoys rich profit margins, and analysts forecast it will grow earnings 24% annually for the next five years.\n\nT-Mobile (TMUS) tmobile (TMUS) logo on an office building facade\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThe ongoing\u00a05G infrastructure rollout is arguably the biggest driver of future growth for telecom giant T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS). It marks the first major upgrade to the country\u2019s telecom infrastructure, allowing greater download speeds. Because data consumption is the biggest profit center for telecoms, the upgrade will help boost earnings further. The analysts at\u00a0PwC\u00a0forecast global data consumption over telecom networks will grow nearly three-fold from 3.4 million petabytes (PB) in 2022 to 9.7 million PB in 2027.\n\nT-Mobile stands to benefit the most as it recently became the largest U.S. wireless carrier, edging out\u00a0Verizon (NYSE:VZ). It recorded 21.6 million prepaid users, while its rival slipped to 21.4 million.\n\nI\u2019ve noted before Wall Street forecasts T-Mobile will enjoy an\u00a0incredible run-up in earnings over the next few years. Analysts estimate profits will expand 43% a year in the long term. At that rate, the stock trades at just a tiny fraction of that growth rate. Investors can expect explosive gains to continue.\n\nRoper Technologies (ROP) Image of Roper Technologies logo visible on display screen\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nRoper Technologies (NASDAQ:ROP) is arguably one of the most under-the-radar technology stocks. It plies its trade in application software, network software, and tech-enabled products, giving it broad market coverage. It\u2019s not flashy like other tech stocks, but it says it is the leader in most markets in which it operates. At the same time, no single competitor competes with it over many product lines. It\u2019s the jack-of-all-trades of tech stocks.\n\nYet Roper still mastered growth. Over the past three decades, Roper Technologies generated total returns of over 33,200%. In contrast, the\u00a0S&P 500 managed just 2,100% returns. It\u2019s up 24% in the past year and just plods on, growing year after year.\n\nWall Street expects long-term earnings growth to triple compared to the last five years. It\u00a0pursues a growth-by-acquisition strategy, buying asset-light, cash-generating businesses. It then reinvests this excess cash in businesses seeking incrementally higher rates of return.\n\nRoper Technologies has a decades-long track record of success and seems equally prepared for decades of growth.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a LONG position in T stock.

The other 494 companies in the S&P 500 are expected to see a 10.5% decline.\n\nFive of those companies \u2014Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Meta \u2014 are set to report quarterly results this week.\n\nAfter the remaining Magnificent Seven tech stock, Tesla (TSLA), disappointed with its report, Evercore ISI managing director Julian Emmanuel described the stock price reaction to these reports as \"critical for overall market direction.\"\n\nThe expectations for some names are massive. Nvidia is expected to grow earnings per share by more than 400% compared to the same period a year prior. Analysts project Meta's earnings per share to grow 175% from the same period a year prior.\n\nThe eye-popping growth for some of the largest stocks in the market is expected to continue next quarter, too. A second chart from FactSet shows that Amazon, Alphabet, Meta and Nvidia are expected to grow earnings by nearly 80% in the first quarter of 2024. The other 496 companies, including Apple Microsoft and Tesla, are expected to grow earnings by a combined 0.3%.\n\n\"Their earnings are incredible compared to the rest of the market,\" JJ Kinahan, IG North America's CEO told Yahoo Finance Live. \"You don't often see this where a few stocks are so outperforming the rest of the market.\"\n\nTo some on Wall Street, these massive earnings expectations help explain why the S&P 500 is hitting all-time highs and still might not be overvalued.\n\n\"There's more growth in that [S&P 500] valuation now than there used to be,\" Pettit said, nodding to the increased position of technology in the index.\n\nStory continues\n\nDuring the market's recent rally, nearly 90% of the growth seen in January has also been driven by the same tech companies excluding Tesla, per analysis from Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre. This comes after the seven tech companies were the major market driver in 2023, and it creates a simple reason for why investors will be watching these reports closely.\n\nStill tech earnings expectations go beyond just the quarterly numbers. It's about updates on various market-moving narratives during earnings calls, too.\n\nArtificial intelligence has been at the center of earnings improvements for Meta and Nvidia. Microsoft and Amazon both have AI plays, too, but their cloud revenues are typically more closely scrutinized. Additionally, Apple's products business can provide a lens into demand for hardware and the overall state of consumer spending.\n\nAll of this combines to make tech earnings crucial for the market \u2014 not only because people expect Big Tech to do well but because if their results miss estimates, the lagging parts of their business could be a flashing a warning sign about an economic slowdown.

Its market capitalization is about $14.5 billion.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNo Apple Car?\n\nIn a memo released as he left, Novotney said, \u201cApple has been my life.\u201d He worked on a variety of products at the company, including the iPod, iPhone, iPad, and Watch.\n\nNovotney is the second Apple Car executive this month to leave for Rivian, a start-up with ties to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Earlier, Jonas Reinke, who had been with Apple for four years, joined Rivian as vice president of product management. Reinke will now work on Rivian\u2019s in-car software.

Plus Q4 Reports from MSFT, GOOGL, AAPL, AMZN", "content": "Who says January\u2019s a long month? This week starts slow, but we\u2019ll end it with a full-fledged Jobs Week for February. Tuesday ushers in new JOLTS data for December, Wednesday brings us private-sector ADP ADP payroll totals for this month (along with the latest Fed decision on interest rates), and Friday is the big non-farm payroll survey from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). All of the forecast numbers are expected to tick down in the labor market, aside from the Unemployment Rate, which is expected to lift back up slightly to 3.8%.\r\n\r\nIn addition, our new week also features several marquee names of the Tech industry reporting earnings: Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet GOOGL on Tuesday, Apple AAPL and Amazon AMZN on Thursday \u2014 all after the closing bell, as per normal. These major firms are all expecting growth on both top and bottom lines, year over year, led by anticipated earnings growth of +285% from Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)-rated Amazon, and +15% revenues growth year over year from Zacks Rank #2-rated Microsoft. (In other news, Amazon is no longer pursuing the acquisition for iRobot, citing antitrust issues, sending the smaller stock down -20% at this hour.)\r\n\r\nElsewhere, there will be a bevy of other reports hitting the tape this week, from Case-Shiller home prices to Consumer Confidence to Q4 Productivity to S&P and ISM Manufacturing. We also look for fresh Q4 earnings reports from across the spectrum of sectors, from AMD AMD to General Motors GM to Mondelez MDLZ to Pfizer PFE to Snapchat SNAP and Starbucks SBUX \u2014 and that\u2019s just tomorrow!\r\n\r\nOff near-term lows on January 18th, three of the four major stock market indices have rebounded into positive territory year-to-date.

Even among those analysts who still believe \u2014 or wish for \u2014 six interest rate cuts between now and the end of the year do not foresee one coming this early. Most of these folks look toward early March for the first cut, though this would likely take much weaker numbers in the economy before the Fed would risk loosening the monetary screws.\r\n\r\nQuestions or comments about this article and/or author?

Davidson, told Yahoo Finance. While businesses are ramping up their AI usage, software makers will likely include AI features as a perk of their existing offerings or as a way to prompt upgrades instead of a paid standalone product.\n\n\u201cThe tools built around generative AI are compelling, but they are in their infancy. They're still working out the kinks,\u201d said Luria. \u201cThe inclination from companies \u2026 will be to bundle these offerings in order to drive adoption, so we're still probably a little bit farther away from being a material growth driver.\u201d\n\nTell that to investors who have become enthralled with the AI trade.\n\nSoftware ETF IGV is up roughly 50% over the past year, compared to a 34% gain for the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) and 20% for the S&P 500 (^GSPC). The outsized performance is mostly driven by AI excitement, said Luria. \"We believe most software companies will face a headwind to their stocks if they don't deliver tangible AI results [this year].\"\n\nMicrosoft still leads the industry, Salesforce well positioned\n\nThe outliers are Microsoft (MSFT) and Adobe (ADBE) \u2014 both D.A. Davidson\u2019s top picks for mega caps due to their advanced AI abilities and solid businesses outside of the field.\n\nAdobe, a leader in text-to-image generation, has incorporated generative AI features across its creative suites, with a generative AI credits system that entices users to pay more to use those functions. Executive Chairman and CEO of Microsoft Corporation, Satya Nadella, speaks during a talk about Microsoft's vision for AI at Chatham House, in London, Britain, January 15, 2024. REUTERS/Anna Gordon (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nMicrosoft, with its Copilot services, is charging users extra for accessing the AI assistants embedded within Microsoft 365, GitHub, and more.\n\nBut the real AI cash cow will remain its cloud service, Azure, which provides access to OpenAI's and others' large language models (LLMs) that developers can use to build their own applications.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile monetization might not come right away, software that aids client-facing roles is well positioned for the future. Generative AI\u2019s potential has been touted as almost limitless, but the proven use cases currently focus on text generation, text summation, and text-to-image generation, per Luria.\n\nThese use cases are most relevant in tasks like pre-populating emails, summarizing calls, and answering common questions \u2014 all functions built into Salesforce\u2019s (CRM) AI assistant, Einstein Copilot, which is targeting the end of February for a public launch.\n\nMorgan Stanley recently upgraded the company's stock to a top pick, citing its consistent revenue growth and relatively muted trading multiples compared to its peers.\n\nData is worth gold in the AI age, so investors should look for firms that lead the field in data access and integration. Salesforce, for example, already hosts a wealth of data from companies using its products to automate customer service, marketing, and other tasks.\n\nIn December, the enterprise SaaS giant announced a new capability to import unstructured data \u2014 think emails and phone calls instead of entries in databases \u2014 into its Data Cloud product, which connects data from its various software offerings.\n\nMore data is the solution to hallucinations, or false answers.\n\n\u201cOne of the most common ways to improve a hallucination or prevent a hallucination is to provide more context,\u201d Patrick Stokes, executive vice president of product and industries marketing at Salesforce, told Yahoo Finance. \u201cIf we can connect the business context into the prompt, the LLM now has the additional information it needs.\u201d\n\nThe future: Smaller models, bots talking to bots\n\nThough large, universal knowledge models like ChatGPT grab all the attention, companies pioneering more efficient models will be the ones raking in the cash. Workers at lamp makers don\u2019t need help drafting emails about the Roman Empire. Smaller models containing only the pertinent information would cost less to operate \u2014 and thus, easier for businesses to profit from. Such efforts are underway at Microsoft and Salesforce, among others.\n\n\u201cWe learned that the company has recently formed an internal team to develop smaller AI models (SLMs) to make AI cheaper to run and seemingly reduce dependencies on OpenAI. These SLMs, such as Phi-2 and Kosmos-2 are intended to rival performance of larger models with significantly fewer parameters,\u201d Citi analysts wrote after attending Microsoft\u2019s AI tour last week.\n\nWhat\u2019s in enterprise AI\u2019s future? One day soon, we may see bots talking to bots \u2014 an AI assistant managing your calendar collaborating with an AI assistant handling your client information \u2014 as platforms become more interoperable.\n\n\u201cIt's like the assistants start helping each other to help the end user,\u201d predicted Nick Johnson, Salesforce\u2019s senior vice president of strategic partnerships.\n\nIf these assistants can program profits for their masters, investors would be all the better.\n\nJennifer Wang is a senior editor at Yahoo Finance.\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ais-path-in-2024-another-year-of-growth-instead-of-monetization-144428152.html", "symbols": ["0R1O.IL", "0RIH.LSE", "ABEA.F", "ABEA.STU", "ABEA.XETRA", "ABEC.F", "ABEC.XETRA", "AMZ.F", "AMZ.XETRA", "AMZN.MI", "AMZN.MX", "AMZN.US", "AMZO34.SA", "CRM.NEO", "CRM.US", "FOO.BE", "FOO.F", "FOO.XETRA", "FOO0.F", "GOGL34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.998, "neg": 0.003, "neu": 0.886, "pos": 0.111}}, {"date": "2024-01-29T14:34:30+00:00", "title": "Amazon terminates iRobot deal, sees 'no path' to EU approval", "content": "Amazon (AMZN) is ending its bid to acquire Roomba-maker iRobot (IRBT).

Now they are saying that they see no path for regulatory approval. More bad news here, iRobot. Take a look at those shares, off about 19% ahead of the open. And also, the fact that it is cutting 31% of its staff as its chair and CEO, saying that he will step down immediately.\n\nLots to unpack here, but Brad, let's first start with the Amazon angle of this because the fact that they are abandoning this $1.4 billion acquisition coming after the deal was pressured from the EU. But I think more so just what this signals more broadly in terms of Amazon needing to defend the fact that it's not a monopoly, that it should be able to get approval for these sort of deals and what this could mean for other M&A activity beyond Amazon but talking about some of those other larger tech names, which has been under pressure now, not only in the EU but also here in the US with the FTC.\n\n- Right, and an uncertain future now here for iRobot, especially with some of the restructuring plans that the company has announced as well on the back of it, undertaking the operational restructuring plan, trying to align cost structure with near term revenue expectations, and to drive profitability is what they say. They're reducing some of their research and development expenses by approximately $20 million year over year. They're also looking to have some margin improvements in generation of approximately $80 to $100 million in savings, not necessarily money that they're going to see just flow in terms of profits.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd so that brings you to the larger question as of what their profit base will actually look like, and then you mentioned the restructuring impacting the employees here, 350 employees, 31% of the company's workforce as of December 2023. A lot of those notifications are going to be taking place unfortunately by the end of March.\n\n- Yeah, certainly, so it's going to likely be under pressure a little bit. And then just going back also just in terms of Amazon, the fact that it needs to prove that some of its actions is not stifling competition elsewhere, that's going to remain a topic here as you look forward to what these big tech giants are going to look like here in several years.\n\n- Absolutely.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/video/amazon-terminates-irobot-deal-sees-143430522.html", "symbols": ["0R1O.IL", "AMZ.F", "AMZ.XETRA", "AMZN.MI", "AMZN.MX", "AMZN.US", "AMZO34.SA", "I8R.F", "I8R.XETRA", "IRBT.US"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.975, "neg": 0.046, "neu": 0.86, "pos": 0.094}}, {"date": "2024-01-29T14:29:46+00:00", "title": "Big Tech earnings: What markets are expecting this week", "content": "Big Tech is next up at bat to report earnings this week, mainly five of the Magnificent Seven components \u2014 Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META), Microsoft (MSFT).\n\nYahoo Finance Markets Reporter Josh Schafer explains market commentary on projected earnings growth for these mega-cap tech companies.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Luke Carberry Mogan.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n- And tech is on deck this week. Some of the stock market's largest technology companies set to report earnings. And for more on how the reports may impact markets, we've got Yahoo Finance's very own Josh Schafer to help us give the rundown for the week ahead.\n\nJOSH SCHAFER: Yeah, Brad. So you take a look at that list we just showed five of the so-called Magnificent Seven. And when you think about Tesla's performance a week ago, maybe we're talking more of a Super Six here and not a Magnificent Seven. So really, you're only missing NVIDIA in terms of massive tech companies to report this week.\n\nAnd really, guys, I think the story here is understanding how big this is going to be for the overall market and the fundamental story that we're seeing in the stock market. So when you take a look at the earnings projections for the six companies-- I'm going to say six here because we're including NVIDIA in the graphic that we're showing, but they're projected to grow earnings-- this is data from FactSet-- at nearly 54% year over year for the fourth quarter.\n\nLook at the other 494 companies. They're expected to have earnings fall 10.5%. So when you think about why stocks move higher and what people are buying, you're buying earnings, right? You want earnings to eventually go up. That is the story of the stock market in the long term. And that's why the short-term story of the stock market has really just been these six stocks. This is what we're waiting for. This is what we-- this is the big moment.\n\nStory continues\n\n- This is what we're waiting for. It's a big moment. And then you pair that also with the jobs data that we're going to be getting out on Friday, the Fed decision on Wednesday. I know you closely are following that as well, Josh.\n\nIn terms of investors' view on this, in terms of the big driver of the market or the key thing that traders are going to be listening for obviously a lot of that's going to be surrounding the timing of that first cut. But beyond that, what do you think has the potential to move the markets this week?\n\nJOSH SCHAFER: Yeah. I mean, it seems like overall, we're still in the soft landing is probably consensus and probably to the upside, right, as far as what people are expecting. So anything that doesn't give us that, when you're thinking maybe a really cool jobs report, perhaps the Fed talking about cutting later than people think or being more restrictive than people think, or I do think the fundamental earnings story from tech because of where the overall S&P is at right now.\n\nI did a story over the weekend about the S&P being potentially overvalued and what strategists say about that. Well, they talk about if you really think about what's in the S&P, you're buying future earnings growth, right? And if you get that earnings growth from these big companies, then one could argue the S&P 500 at a record high isn't overvalued, and it has room to keep growing.\n\nSo you get all three aspects this week, right? We talk about the Fed a lot. That can move your major indexes and move things. We talked about the Mag Seven. We're getting that. And we've got a jobs report on Friday because why not?\n\n- So I guess we'll talk on Friday, and we'll decide what the biggest mover was of the week.\n\n- Certainly setting up to be a very busy week here potentially for the markets.

Revenues are forecasted to be $166.26 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of 11.4%.\n\nOver the past 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been adjusted upward by 2.8% to its current level. This demonstrates the covering analysts' collective reassessment of their initial projections during this period.\n\nBefore a company reveals its earnings, it is vital to take into account any changes in earnings projections. These revisions play a pivotal role in predicting the possible reactions of investors toward the stock. Multiple empirical studies have consistently shown a strong association between trends in earnings estimates and the short-term price movements of a stock.\n\nWhile investors typically use consensus earnings and revenue estimates as indicators of quarterly business performance, exploring analysts' projections for specific key metrics can offer valuable insights.\n\nWith that in mind, let's delve into the average projections of some Amazon metrics that are commonly tracked and projected by analysts on Wall Street.\n\nAnalysts forecast 'Net Sales- AWS' to reach $24.32 billion. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +13.8%.\n\nAnalysts' assessment points toward 'Net sales- Physical stores' reaching $5.31 billion. The estimate suggests a change of +7% year over year.\n\nThe consensus among analysts is that 'Net sales- Online stores' will reach $68.53 billion. The estimate suggests a change of +6.2% year over year.\n\nThe combined assessment of analysts suggests that 'Net Sales- Subscription services' will likely reach $10.40 billion. The estimate suggests a change of +13.2% year over year.\n\nIt is projected by analysts that the 'Geographic Revenue- North America' will reach $103.28 billion. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +10.6%.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to the collective judgment of analysts, 'Net Sales- Advertising services' should come in at $14.07 billion. The estimate suggests a change of +21.7% year over year.\n\nThe collective assessment of analysts points to an estimated 'Geographic Revenue - International' of $38.36 billion. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +11.3%.\n\nBased on the collective assessment of analysts, 'Net Sales- Third-party seller services' should arrive at $41.47 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +14.1% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nThe consensus estimate for 'Subscription services Y/Y Change' stands at 13.5%. Compared to the current estimate, the company reported 13% in the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nAnalysts expect 'Third-party seller services Y/Y Change' to come in at 14.0%. Compared to the current estimate, the company reported 20% in the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nAnalysts predict that the 'Headcount - Total' will reach 1,514,658. The estimate compares to the year-ago value of 1,541,000.\n\nThe average prediction of analysts places 'WW shipping costs' at $26.56 billion.

(AMZN) Soars to 52-Week High, Time to Cash Out?", "content": "Have you been paying attention to shares of Amazon (AMZN)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 4.7% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $160.72 in the previous session. Amazon has gained 4.7% since the start of the year compared to the 29.7% move for the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector and the 58.3% return for the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry.\n\nWhat's Driving the Outperformance?\n\nThe stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on October 26, 2023, Amazon reported EPS of $0.85 versus consensus estimate of $0.58.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, Amazon is expected to post earnings of $3.66 per share on $571.07 billion in revenues. Meanwhile, for the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $4.73 per share on $636.82 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 35.54% and 11.51%, respectively.\n\nValuation Metrics\n\nAmazon may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.\n\nOn this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.\n\nAmazon has a Value Score of C. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and A, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A.\n\nIn terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 43.4X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is a premium to the peer industry average of 19.7X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 33.1X versus its peer group's average of 15.5X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.52. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.\n\nStory continues\n\nZacks Rank\n\nWe also need to consider the stock's Zacks Rank, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Amazon currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.\n\nSince we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Amazon meets the list of requirements. Thus, it seems as though Amazon shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term.\n\nHow Does AMZN Stack Up to the Competition?\n\nShares of AMZN have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is MercadoLibre, Inc. (MELI). MELI has a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and a Value Score of C, a Growth Score of A, and a Momentum Score of B.\n\nEarnings were strong last quarter.

The company also said founder Colin Angle has stepped down as its CEO.\n\nAngle said given the current challenges, he and the board \"mutually decided that iRobot will be better served by a new leader with turnaround experience.\" Amazon said its proposed $1.4 billion acquisition of iRobot had no path to regulatory approval in the European Union. Reuters reported earlier this month the deal would be blocked by European Commission antitrust regulators and that its main concerns were that Amazon may thwart iRobot rivals on its online marketplace, especially in France, Germany, Italy, and Spain.\n\nAmazon announced the deal in August 2022. The world's largest online retailer, which already owns Alexa and Ring, was pushing to expand its stable of smart home devices as well as expanding the e-commerce giant's virtual healthcare.\n\n\"We're disappointed that Amazon's acquisition of iRobot could not proceed,\" said David Zapolsky, Amazon's general counsel. \"We're believers in the future of consumer robotics in the home and have always been fans of iRobot's products,\" he added in a statement.\n\nBedford, Massachusetts-based iRobot said it expects to report full-year 2023 revenue of $891 million, a 25% reduction and a loss of between $265 and $285 million. Under the terms of the merger agreement, Amazon will pay iRobot a $94 million termination fee.\n\nAmazon has had a mixed record with competition regulators in recent years, completing a deal for healthcare provider One Medical and MGM's movie catalogue.\n\nBut it faces a lengthy court battle in a Seattle federal court with the FTC over accusations the company uses illegal strategies to boost profits at its online retail empire, including an algorithm that allegedly pushed up prices by more than $1 billion.\n\niRobot shares fell 18.5% in trading Monday before the market opened. Since first reports the deal might be blocked by EU regulators two weeks ago, iRobot shares have fallen by half.\n\nCritics opposed the deal, saying it would strengthen Amazon.com's already powerful position in smart home devices.

This week\u2019s list includes Nvidia NVDA, Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Meta Platforms META and Amazon AMZN.\n\nBig Tech Earnings Loom: What Can Investors Expect?\n\nTech stocks have maintained their market leadership in the New Year, building on last year's standout performance. Driving this momentum has been a combination of favorable developments on the macro front, primarily growing confidence that the Fed is on track to start easing policy, having subdued inflation without endangering the economy.\n\nMore specific to the Tech sector is optimism about the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) that some view warily as reminiscent of the late 1990s and an emerging sense we are getting close to putting the worst of Tech spending headwinds behind us.\n\nWith many Tech companies on deck to report December-quarter results this week, the market will be looking for more color on business spending trends, particularly on the cloud side.\n\nA big part of Tech's improved earnings outlook in 2023 was a function of more effective cost controls that helped stabilize margins. Improved clarity on top-line trends will help solidify the favorable revisions trend and undergird the group's impressive stock market momentum.\n\nOn top of it all is the AI debate, where we have already seen direct revenue impact from the likes of Nvidia and some ideas from Microsoft. Still, the innovation's productivity-enhancing potential appears to be some ways off in the future.\n\nThe stock market is essentially a discounting system of the future. To the extent that we see viable business models in the days ahead that make use of AI and the so-called large language models, beyond Nvidia selling more capable chips and Microsoft starting to charge for new AI-driven bells and whistles in its Office productivity suite, the stock market excitement would be totally justified.\n\nStory continues\n\nThese topics will be front and center in this week's earnings reports from five of the 'Big 7 Tech players' - Alphabet and Microsoft after the market's close on Tuesday (1/30), Meta Platforms, Amazon and Apple after the close on Thursday (02/01). Of the remaining two members of this 'club,' Tesla has reported already, and Nvidia's results will be coming out at the end of February.\n\nApple shares may not have had as impressive a showing as the other distinguished members of this club, but it has nevertheless been a standout performer. The bigger question in the Apple story appears to be the China outlook, though headlines about the watch line may have also weighed on sentiment.\n\nDigital advertising has historically been seen as core to Alphabet and Meta, but Amazon has steadily become a major player in the space as well. Ad spending has stabilized in the last couple of quarters, and it will be interesting to see how these management teams see trends for the current and coming periods, given the macroeconomic uncertainties. This will also be at play in the Snap report, which reports Q4 results the following week (February 6th).\n\nAll of these companies are big players in the artificial intelligence (AI) space, with the Microsoft vs. Alphabet rivalry particularly intense. With the initial excitement around ChatGPT and other AI applications now behind us, the questions now center around how these AI capabilities will be monetized through new and existing business models. It is reasonable to expect each of these management teams to spend considerable time on their Q4 earnings calls on their AI plan.\n\nThe group is expected to bring in +38.6% more earnings relative to the same period last year on +12.4% higher revenues. Please note that these expectations have steadily increased in recent months.\n\nAs we all know by now, the group's phenomenal boost in 2021 partly reflected pulled-forward demand from future periods that got primarily adjusted in 2022. As you can see above, the expectation is for the group to be firmly back in the 'regular/normal' growth model, but much of that is contingent on how the macroeconomic picture unfolds.\n\nBeyond these mega-cap players, total Q4 earnings for the Technology sector as a whole are expected to be up +19.3% from the same period last year on +7.1% higher revenues.\n\nAs was the case with the 'Big 7 Tech Players,' the Tech sector as a whole has been dealing with the pulled-forward revenues and earnings during Covid over the last many quarters. In fact, earnings growth for the Zacks Tech sector turned positive only in 2023 Q2 after remaining in negative territory during the four quarters prior to that.\n\nThis big-picture view of the 'Big 7 players' and the overall sector shows that the worst of the growth challenge has moved into the rearview mirror.\n\nThe Earnings Big Picture\n\nThe 2023 Q4 earnings are expected to be up +1.1% on +2.4% higher revenues. This follows the +3.8% earnings growth reading we saw in the preceding period (2023 Q3) and three back-to-back quarters of declining earnings prior to that.\n\nQ4 Earnings Season Scorecard\n\nIncluding all the results that came out through Friday, January 26th, we now have Q4 results from 124 S&P 500 members, or 24.8% of the index's total membership.\n\nWe have over 300 companies on deck to report results this week, including 106 S&P 500 members. In addition to the aforementioned mega-tech players, this week's line-up includes a who's who of the index, including Boeing, Pfizer, International Paper, Starbucks, Exxon, Chevron, and many others.\n\nTotal Q4 earnings for the 124 index members that have reported already are down -0.4% from the same period last year on +3.4% higher revenues, with 79% beating EPS estimates and 69.4% beating revenue estimates.\n\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>>Breaking Down the Q4 Earnings Season Scorecard\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +6.2 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +46.4%, +49.5% and +55.2% per year.

This deal would have allowed Amazon to invest in continued innovation by iRobot and support iRobot in lowering prices on products customers already love. The companies released the following statements today about the decision:\n\n\"We\u2019re disappointed that Amazon\u2019s acquisition of iRobot could not proceed,\" said David Zapolsky, Amazon SVP and General Counsel. \"We\u2019re believers in the future of consumer robotics in the home and have always been fans of iRobot\u2019s products, which delight consumers and solve problems in ways that improve their lives. Amazon and iRobot were excited to see what our teams could build together, and we\u2019re deeply grateful to everyone who worked tirelessly to try and make this collaboration a reality. This outcome will deny consumers faster innovation and more competitive prices, which we\u2019re confident would have made their lives easier and more enjoyable. Mergers and acquisitions like this help companies like iRobot better compete in the global marketplace, particularly against companies, and from countries, that aren\u2019t subject to the same regulatory requirements in fast-moving technology segments like robotics. Undue and disproportionate regulatory hurdles discourage entrepreneurs, who should be able to see acquisition as one path to success, and that hurts both consumers and competition\u2014the very things that regulators say they\u2019re trying to protect.\"\n\nStory continues\n\n\"iRobot is an innovation pioneer with a clear vision to make consumer robots a reality,\" said Colin Angle, Founder of iRobot. \"The termination of the agreement with Amazon is disappointing, but iRobot now turns toward the future with a focus and commitment to continue building thoughtful robots and intelligent home innovations that make life better, and that our customers around the world love.\"\n\nThe companies have signed a termination agreement that resolves all outstanding matters from the transaction, including Amazon paying iRobot the previously agreed upon termination fee.\n\nAbout Amazon\n\nAmazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. Amazon strives to be Earth\u2019s Most Customer-Centric Company, Earth\u2019s Best Employer, and Earth\u2019s Safest Place to Work. Customer reviews, 1-Click shopping, personalized recommendations, Prime, Fulfillment by Amazon, AWS, Kindle Direct Publishing, Kindle, Career Choice, Fire tablets, Fire TV, Amazon Echo, Alexa, Just Walk Out technology, Amazon Studios, and The Climate Pledge are some of the things pioneered by Amazon.

He has been called \"arguably the greatest hedge fund manager of his generation,\" by Forbes. Tepper has \"consistently outperformed his industry peers and the broader global markets since [Appaloosa's] inception,\" according to Tepper's bio posted by Carnegie Mellon University.\n\nOver the past three years, Appaloosa has outperformed the S&P 500 by 15%, no small feat, given the macroeconomic backdrop. His strong track record suggests that Tepper's stock picks might be worth further review. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nInvestors might be surprised to discover that, to close out the third quarter, Tepper had a whopping 47.1% of Appaloosa's portfolio invested in just five artificial intelligence (AI) stocks:\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META): 11.6% Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT): 10.2% Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN): 9.4% Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA): 8.8% Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG): 7.2%\n\nLet's take a look at Tepper's five top picks to see why he's so heavily weighted toward these AI stocks.\n\n1. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms might seem a surprising choice, but the company has a long history of using AI to bolster its business. The vast majority of Meta's revenue comes from digital advertising, and AI can more accurately surface relevant ads and other content on its social media sites.\n\nAs the world's second-largest digital advertiser, the recent rebound in ad spending has bolstered the company's fortunes. Meta has also released several AI-powered tools to help advertisers more accurately connect with their target market. Perhaps as importantly, the company developed a leading open-source AI model -- Llama (Large Language Model Meta AI) -- which is available on all the major cloud infrastructure platforms, resulting in an entirely new revenue stream for the company.\n\nAt just 20 times forward earnings, Meta is selling at a discount compared to the broader market -- which likely factored into Tepper's investing decision.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft saw the writing on the wall and invested $13 billion in ChatGPT creator OpenAI over the past few years, helping spotlight the potential for generative AI. Its big tech rivals quickly follow suit, kicking demand for AI into overdrive. The tech giant answered the growing demand by infusing AI functionality across a broad swath of its software-as-a-service (SaaS) offerings. Furthermore, all the most popular AI models are available on Azure Cloud.\n\nThe biggest coup, however, was the debut of Microsoft Copilot, its AI assistant. Its ability to increase user productivity has generated strong demand and could produce incremental revenue of up to $100 billion by 2027, according to analyst calculations. Azure's growth outpaced the competition in the third quarter, and Microsoft pointed out that three percentage points of that growth was the result of growing demand for AI.\n\nMicrosoft is currently trading for 31 times forward earnings. While that's a slight premium to the market, the company's strong legacy businesses and the opportunity afforded by AI make Microsoft a bargain at this price, which likely didn't escape Tepper's notice.\n\n3. Amazon\n\nWhile some viewed Amazon as slow out of the gate, it has jumped into the AI opportunity with both feet. The company has long used AI to handle product recommendations, inventory levels, delivery routes, and more.\n\nYet that's just the beginning of Amazon's AI opportunity. The company is now using generative AI to improve product listings, generate review summaries, and refine advertising. It also is working on an AI-powered tool that can answer questions about specific products.\n\nThere's more. Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers a growing list of popular generative AI models, including a few of its own via its Bedrock AI. The company has also unveiled several AI-centric chips, including Inferentia and Trainium, designed to speed AI processing for AWS customers.\n\nDespite its strong recovery last year, Amazon is still selling for just 2 times forward sales, the standard for an underpriced stock, which likely piqued Tepper's interest.\n\n4. Nvidia\n\nNo discussion about AI stocks would be complete without a nod to Nvidia, a point highlighted by Tepper's position. Nvidia pioneered the graphics processing units (GPUs) that revolutionized gaming and are the gold standard for AI applications.\n\nNvidia's processors have cornered the market in both data centers and machine learning, with an estimated 95% share in each. Experience in the field helped Nvidia quickly pivot to address the growing demand for generative AI.\n\nCompetitors are scrambling to develop competing processors, but Nvidia continues to maintain its edge. For the nine months ended Oct. 29, 2023, Nvidia spent $6.2 billion, or 16% of its total revenue, on research and development. The company's track record of continuing innovation will make it difficult to supplant.\n\nDespite the stock's recent run, Nvidia is still remarkably cheap, sporting a price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG ratio) of less than 1 -- that benchmark for an undervalued stock -- of which Tepper was no doubt keenly aware.\n\n5. Alphabet\n\nLike Meta Platforms, Alphabet makes the lion's share of its revenue from digital advertising, in this case fueled by Google Search. The company has an impressive track record of deploying AI to improve its search algorithms and ad targeting, and the recovering ad market will no doubt improve the company's results.\n\nAlphabet didn't sleep on the potential of generative AI. The company integrated AI functionality into many of its flagship Google and Android products. As one of the Big Three cloud providers, it was able to expand the number of AI systems available to its Google Cloud customers.\n\nIts most recent offering, Gemini AI, is being hailed by the company as its \"largest and most capable AI model,\" outperforming rivals using a variety of widely used benchmarks. Furthermore, Alphabet's Vertex AI provides access to 130 foundational AI models with something for just about every use case.\n\nThe company's rebound over the past year notwithstanding, Alphabet still sells for just 19 times forward earnings, a valuation that Tepper likely couldn't pass up.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Meta Platforms wasn't one of them.

But as the old adage goes, past performance is no guarantee of future results.\n\nWith most everything returning to long-term norms following the effective wind-down of the COVID-19 pandemic, we should start to see all stocks -- even the FAANG shares -- better reflect their underlying companies' true worth.\n\nOne FAANG name that appears to have better prospects than the others right now is e-commerce giant Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN). Here's why.\n\nWhy Amazon is your best bet right now\n\nDon't panic if you already own one of the other FAANG stocks and don't have room in your portfolio for a new pick just yet. You'll be fine. All of them are long-term winners.\n\nBut the metrics look especially favorable for Amazon right now. Analysts are calling for top-line growth of a little more than 11% this year, with comparable-revenue growth in the cards every year through 2028. Profits are projected to grow from last year's expected figure of $2.68 per share all the way to $9.25 in the final year of that five-year stretch.\n\nHow is this older, already-enormous company still producing such growth? In a couple of different but complementary ways. One of these ways is its inaugural business: e-commerce. But there's a twist. Veteran investors will recall a time when Amazon was barely profitable -- if profitable at all. Its mission was growth at almost any cost.\n\nA funny thing's happened over the course of just the past few years, perhaps cemented into place by the unique circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic. Amazon's e-commerce operation has turned more profitable than it's ever been before. Even its long-beleaguered international e-commerce arm is finally inching its way to sustained operating profitability.\n\nIt's not exactly happening in the way you might expect, however. Over the course of the past three years, the company has turned up the heat on its advertising business, which allows third-party sellers to more prominently feature their products at Amazon.com. This venture produced a little over $31 billion in revenue in 2021 but has since reached an annualized pace of nearly $44 billion. Market research outfit Insider Intelligence believes this figure will reach on the order of $68 billion worth of revenue in 2025.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis is high-margin revenue too, leveraging the Western world's most-frequently visited online-shopping site that Amazon spent the last 25 years perfecting. Indeed, it's conceivable that its advertising venture could be a bigger and better breadwinner than e-commerce alone might ever have become.\n\nAmazon's other key growth driver for the near and distant future is Amazon's cloud-computing arm, Amazon Web Services (AWS). It may not be Amazon's biggest business as measured by sales. In fact, AWS only accounts for about 16% of the company's total top line. Yet, cloud computing regularly makes up more than two-thirds of Amazon's operating income, and it's still just getting started.\n\nMordor Intelligence says the cloud-computing market is set to swell from roughly $700 billion this year to more than $1.4 trillion in 2029, similar to projections from Precedence Research as well as GlobalData. Data source: Amazon. Chart by author. Figures are in billions.\n\nAlready a market-share leader, AWS is positioned to capture at least its fair share of this growth. It may capture more than its fair share of this growth, in fact, now that it's custom-building cloud-computing platforms that specifically work with the market's preferred AI tech. For instance, AWS and Nvidia are now collaborating to offer supercomputing infrastructure built around Nvidia's powerful NVIDIA GH200 chips. This is the sort of powerful platform needed for next-generation generative artificial intelligence (AI) offerings.\n\nOther FAANG stocks are ok too, but...\n\nAgain, don't panic if you already own stakes in one or more of the other FAANG stocks and aren't ready to reorganize your holdings. There are certainly plenty of worse ways to be positioned as we move deeper into the first half of 2024.\n\nBut if I had to choose one, Amazon is the group's top prospect right now. And for what it's worth, the analyst community agrees. The vast majority of this crowd currently rates the stock as a strong buy, and the consensus target of $184 is a healthy 17% above the stock's present price.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Amazon wasn't one of them.

For those who want to pay up for the premium, ad-free version, the price will go up by $3 a month, respectively.\n\n\"A 500 lb. gorilla enters the room,\" MoffettNathanson lead analyst Michael Morton wrote in a note to clients on Friday. \"We strongly believe that Amazon\u2019s decision to add advertising to Prime Video will be a disruptive force to commoditized advertising video on demand (AVOD) players, siloed connected TV (CTV) platforms and non-top 20 linear cable networks.\"\n\nAmazon has roughly 96 million US Prime households, but only a subset of that actively engages with Prime Video, according to MoffettNathanson. The firm estimates Prime Video, which streams shows like \"Reacher\" and \"The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power,\" has an active US subscriber base that's roughly equivalent to Netflix\u2019s 70 million.\n\nAs a result of the new rollout, the firm anticipates video ad revenue of $1.3 billion in 2024and $2.3 billion in 2025. Subscription revenue should also go up by $500 million annually for those who opt to pay extra for the premium tier.\n\n\"We forecast Amazon and Disney (DIS) being neck-and-neck for largest drivers of AVOD ad-revenue,\" the analysts wrote, predicting the US connected TV and ad-supported market will hit $16 billion by 2025.\n\nAmazon is expected to lead the pack at $4 billion with Hulu close behind at $3 billion. Peacock (CMCSA) and Roku (ROKU) round out the top four at $2.3 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively.\n\nFollowing its US debut, the ad tier will roll out globally in the UK and Germany on Feb. 5 before dropping in France, Italy, Spain, Mexico, and Australia later this year. Amazon said it plans to have \"meaningfully fewer ads than linear TV and other streaming TV providers.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to Adweek, ad buyers will pay a cost-per-thousand, or CPM rate, between $30 to $35. That's lower than what they pay to advertise on competitor platforms, which analysts say could lead to downward pressure on pricing.\n\nTo compare, Netflix (NFLX) and Disney were reportedly seeking a CPM rate between $50 and $60 for their respective ad tiers. Pushback from advertisers eventually convinced them to lower their asking price. Amazon will officially roll out ads on its Prime Video streaming service beginning Monday in the US. (Rafael Henrique/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) (SOPA Images via Getty Images)\n\nIn addition to pricing, Amazon's decision to default users to the ad-supported tier also differs from competitors, although it was considered by one streaming giant.\n\n\"We did consider making [ads] the default option,\" Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters said on Wednesday's earnings call. \"But given our long history of not having ads, we thought it was better for our members \u2014 rather than force them into a change and give them ads.\"\n\nPeters added he's not concerned when it comes to Amazon entering the ad-supported arena, telling investors there's plenty of ad inventory to go around.\n\n\"We talked about over $25 billion in [connected TV] ad spend alone, so there's room for multiple players,\" he said, noting the streamer will compete by \"playing to its strengths\" like viewership engagement.\n\nStill, the move is widely expected to massively transform the industry.\n\n\"Amazon has one of the broadest audience reaches of all the streaming services,\" Macquarie analyst Tim Nollen told Yahoo Finance. \"They have the reach, they have the consumer data. There will likely be an acceleration toward retail media spending, which could encourage everybody else to do more shop-able advertising.\"\n\n\"It just raises the stakes,\" the analyst continued. \"Everybody now faces another competitor and a very large supply of inventory that they're going to be competing for. It'll drive more demand, or better tools to get better pricing on ads through better targeting or better use of programmatic advertising.\"\n\nNollen added Amazon's entrance will also encourage a substantial shift of ad buyers from linear to streaming \u2014 yet another blow to legacy media as the cable bundle continues to deteriorate.\n\n\"Among media companies, the entire media sector would appear to be at risk with the greatest pain at Paramount (PARA) and AMC Networks (AMCX) given their lack of diversified profitability away from linear networks and limited exposure to live cable network content,\" MoffettNathanson wrote in its report.\n\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Here are two outstanding companies that are poised to capture a sizable share of the AI industry's profit in the coming years.\n\nAmazon.com\n\nArtificial intelligence will be built in the cloud. As the leading provider of cloud infrastructure services, Amazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) is well situated to profit from the AI boom.\n\nIn addition to providing the raw computing resources that power a growing number of AI applications, Amazon is striving to become a leader in generative AI. Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers its customers access to powerful tools, such as its Titan foundation models, as well as AI models developed by Anthropic, Stability AI, and other promising machine learning upstarts. Better still, Amazon's highly efficient Trainium and Inferentia chips can help slash the costs of training models and running AI workloads on AWS.\n\nE-commerce remains another potent growth driver for Amazon. Global online retail sales will top $8.1 trillion by 2026, up from $6.3 trillion in 2023, according to Statista. Moreover, Amazon's cost-cutting efforts are helping to boost its operating margin as its sales rise. That's an excellent formula for rapid and sustained earnings growth.\n\nAdvertising is another notable opportunity. Third-party sellers pay hefty fees to market their products to the online retail titan's massive customer base. Amazon, in turn, is winning market share in a digital ad industry that's forecast to reach $1.5 trillion by 2030, up from $531 billion in 2022, according to ResearchAndMarkets.\n\nWith these powerful trends fueling its growth, Amazon's share price could soar in the years ahead.\n\nNvidia\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is also a prime beneficiary of the AI megatrend. The semiconductor giant's state-of-the-art chip designs lie at the heart of the computing systems that power many of the leading AI applications.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia's graphics processing units can be used to train the large language models that underlie popular AI services such as ChatGPT. Demand for these cutting-edge chips is projected to soar to $400 billion by 2027, according to rival chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices. Nvidia commands more than 85% of this booming market, according to analysts at Raymond James.\n\nThe impact of this surging demand is transforming Nvidia's financial results. The tech titan's sales climbed 206% year over year to $18.1 billion in the quarter ended Oct. 29. Its adjusted operating profits, in turn, increased a stunning 652% to $11.6 billion.\n\nYet it's important to note that Nvidia is far more than just an AI growth story. Management sees a $100 billion market for the company's gaming-related chips and a $300 billion opportunity for its autonomous machine technology. All told, the company estimates its total addressable market at a whopping $1 trillion.\n\nNvidia clearly has plenty of room for further expansion, and Wall Street seems to agree. Analysts expect Nvidia's sales to grow by roughly 119% in 2024 and 57% in 2025 -- and its earnings to increase by over 100% annually over the next half-decade. Buy shares today, and you can position yourself to profit alongside this AI-powered tech titan.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

(UPST) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nDespite the challenging environment for consumer lending in 2023, Upstart (NASDAQ:UPST) has maintained financial stability. The company is EBITDA-positive for the second straight quarter, and contribution margins remain near record highs, indicating solid operational efficiency.\n\nAdditionally, Upstart continues to invest in its AI platform with the launch of Model 15.0, the latest version of its core personal loan underwriting model. Specifically, Model 15.0 increased model accuracy by about\u00a015%, representing the largest improvement since tracking improvements began in 2018. The AI-driven credit models perform as expected, suggesting Upstart\u2019s focus on innovation and continuous improvement.\n\nFurthermore, Upstart has successfully expanded its offerings beyond personal loans. The company\u2019s auto retail platform saw significant growth, with a major original equipment manufacturer implementing Upstart\u2019s software to support a new vehicle launch. Expanding car dealerships and partnerships with national non-prime auto lenders demonstrate Upstart\u2019s focus on diversifying its business and tapping into new markets.\n\nMoreover, Upstart has made progress in the home equity market by launching the Upstart HELOC (Home Equity Line of Credit) product. The HELOC product is positioned as a prime product with expected annual loss rates of\u00a01% or less, providing a counter-cyclical approach to Upstart\u2019s refinance product. Upstart aims to bring a pricing advantage to the HELOC market and differentiate itself through speed, ease of access, and leveraging its existing platform for customer acquisition.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinally, despite challenges in the lending environment, Upstart has seen success with credit unions and views them as valuable partners. The company is doubling down on credit unions by enhancing features and connectivity and supporting loan participation, which improves liquidity. Thus, Upstart is actively pursuing committed funding partnerships to strengthen the reliability of loan funding, recognizing the importance of alternative sources.\n\nUiPath (PATH) The UiPath (PATH) app is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock.com\n\nUiPath (NYSE:PATH) continues to witness momentum in the financial services and healthcare sectors, where automation delivers significant value. There is a large non-profit health system in the U.S., one of the top 25 customers. The example of the health system, starting with core robotic process automation in 2018 and gradually adopting additional features like attendance automation, document understanding, test suites, and process mining, demonstrates UiPath\u2019s ability to grow and evolve with its customers.\n\nAdditionally, UiPath\u2019s lead in landing new logos is highlighted, with companies like Tenable and KIK Consumer Products adopting multiple platform products in their initial purchases. Also, NorthStar, UiPath\u2019s value-based go-to-market tool, focuses on driving deeper customer conversations. Specifically, NorthStar\u2019s impact on existing customers, as illustrated by the case of Sobeys expanding its automation footprint based on a NorthStar roadmap. Hence, this signifies the tool\u2019s effectiveness in maximizing the return on investment for UiPath\u2019s customers.\n\nFurthermore, UiPath\u2019s strategic partnerships, such as the collaboration with SAP (NYSE:SAP) and the expanded partnership with Deloitte, are crucial for expanding its reach and driving increased engagement with Global Systems Integrators (GSIs). The embedding of UiPath\u2019s AI-powered business automation platform into Deloitte\u2019s Ascend service delivery platform indicates the depth of collaboration.\n\nFinally, UiPath\u2019s focus on broadening its technology ecosystem is evident in\u00a0recent partnerships with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Bedrock. Also, the AI-Powered Business Automation Platform is available on the Alphabet\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Cloud Marketplace. These partnerships facilitate seamless integration and accessibility for automation developers. Therefore, integrating widely used platforms enhances UiPath\u2019s market presence and value growth potential.\n\nJabil (JBL) Male and Female Industrial Engineers in Hard Hats Discuss New Project while Using Laptop. They Make Showing Gestures.They Work in a Heavy Industry Manufacturing Factory. manufacturing stocks\n\nSource: Gorodenkoff via Shutterstock\n\nJabil\u2019s (NYSE:JBL) revenue and operating income are its fundamentals, supporting its value potential. For instance, Jabil\u2019s Q1 fiscal 2024 has an approximately $8.4 billion revenue, near the low end of the guidance range provided in September. The revenue trend is a crucial numerical indicator of Jabil\u2019s financial health. Despite being slightly below expectations, the scale of revenue, $8.4 billion, demonstrates the company\u2019s substantial market presence.\n\nFurthermore, the core operating income for the quarter is revealed to be\u00a0$499 million, representing 6% of revenue. This is up 1.2% year-over-year, signaling improved operating efficiency and profitability. The improvement reflects a better business mix, normal seasonal mobility patterns, and accounting impacts of assets held for sale. Excluding the impact of assets held for sale, the company reported the core operating margin as roughly 5.3%. Hence, this indicates a still robust margin even when accounting for certain exceptional items.\n\nIn the middle of the top and bottom lines, the net interest expense was $70 million, which is $3 million better than expected. This improvement is based on lower quarterly inventory levels due to lower revenue and better-working capital management.\n\nFinally, from a profitability perspective, the diluted earnings per share (EPS) was $1.47. Core diluted EPS for the quarter was reported at $2.60, a significant 13% improvement over Q1 fiscal 2024. Therefore, this improvement in core EPS is considered a positive indicator of the company\u2019s profitability and value generation.\n\nOn the date of publication, Yiannis Zourmpanos did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

However, that doesn't mean that it won't be the case.\n\nIn 2023, the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks ruled the stock market. Each of the seven stocks skyrocketed by 48% or more (for some, much more). But how does Wall Street think they'll perform going forward?\n\nNot-so-magnificent forecasts\n\nWall Street has some not-so-magnificent forecasts for most of the \"Magnificent Seven.\" Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) delivered the second-biggest gain of the group last year, with its share price nearly tripling in value. The stock is off to a good start in 2024 as well, rising more than 10%. The average 12-month price target for Meta is even lower than its current share price now, though.\n\nAnalysts don't have great expectations for Alphabet, either. The Google parent's shares vaulted 58% higher in 2023. The consensus price target for the stock today reflects a meager upside potential of around 2%.\n\nApple doesn't fare much better on Wall Street. Although the tech giant's shares jumped 48% last year, analysts' average price target for the stock is only 3% above the current share price.\n\nMicrosoft is running neck-and-neck with Apple as the biggest company based on market cap after a 57% gain in 2023. Analysts aren't looking for the momentum to continue, however. The consensus price target reflects an upside potential of around 4%.\n\nNo large-cap stock generated as much excitement last year as Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). The generative AI boom drove the chipmaker's share price up a whopping 239%. Nvidia has extended those gains so far in 2024, rising close to 25%. The party won't keep going, according to Wall Street. The average price target for Nvidia is less than 5% above its current share price.\n\nWall Street's favorites\n\nIf you've kept count, we've ruled out five of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. That leaves only Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) and Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN).\n\nStory continues\n\nTesla boasts the greatest upside potential based on the latest data available even after its shares more than doubled last year. The average 12-month price target for the stock is nearly 24% above the electric vehicle maker's current share price.\n\nHowever, there's a big gotcha. Tesla's shares sank last week after the company announced disappointing fourth-quarter results. Its warning of a major slowdown in sales growth in 2024 was especially worrisome. Don't be surprised if some analysts soon lower their price targets for the stock.\n\nAmazon stock vaulted 81% higher in 2023. Many on Wall Street think that it will keep the momentum going this year. The consensus price target for Amazon reflects an upside potential of nearly 16%.\n\nThere's also more of a consensus about Amazon than there is for Tesla. Of the 47 analysts surveyed by LSEG in January who cover the stock, 43 rated it as a buy or strong buy. Only eight of the 23 analysts who cover Tesla recommended it as a buy or a strong buy. Seven analysts rated the stock as an \"underperform\" or recommended selling it.\n\nAre the analysts right?\n\nI wouldn't bet the farm that any of Wall Street's price targets will prove to be accurate. There's no way to know for sure how a given stock will perform over a 12-month period.\n\nIf I had to guess which of these stocks will beat analysts' expectations the most, I'd go with Meta. Its valuation looks relatively attractive. I won't be surprised if the company's earnings continue to grow if the economy doesn't falter.\n\nWhich \"Magnificent Seven\" stock is Wall Street most likely to be right about? Probably Amazon, in my opinion. The company's profitability and free cash flow are improving significantly. Amazon also has a big opportunity as IT spending transitions to the cloud, as do Alphabet and Microsoft.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Amazon wasn't one of them.

The reason for that optimism can be summarized in three points: improving profitability in retail, strong momentum in digital advertising, and a potential reacceleration in cloud services revenue driven by demand for artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nArgus Research analyst Jim Kelleher highlighted that last point in a recent note to clients, speaking on the potential of Amazon Web Services (AWS): \"As the leading provider of infrastructure-as-a-service and other cloud services, AWS is uniquely positioned in the burgeoning AI-as-a-service market, and the Anthropic partnership meaningfully strengthens AWS at a key time in the AI gold rush.\"\n\nThat may surprise some investors given that Nvidia is viewed as the best AI stock in certain Wall Street circles. But the point is somewhat irrelevant because attempting to pick a single winner is a poor strategy. It would be more prudent to build a basket of AI stocks, and Amazon definitely deserves a place in such a basket. Here's why.\n\nAmazon has a strong presence in three growing markets\n\nAmazon reported encouraging financial results in the third quarter. Revenue increased 13% to $143.1 billion on strong growth in advertising services. The cloud computing business Amazon Web Services (AWS) continued to drag on the top line, but deal trends point to a reacceleration in the coming quarters. On the bottom line, net income under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) more than tripled to reach $9.9 billion due to cost reduction efforts like regionalization of its U.S. fulfillment network.\n\nThe graphic below details third-quarter revenue across all seven business segments. Chart by Author. Shown above is Amazon's third quarter revenue across all seven business segments.\n\nAmazon has a strong presence in three markets that should support double-digit sales growth for many years to come.\n\nStory continues\n\nE-commerce: Amazon operates the most visited online marketplace in the world, and it has steadily gained share across North America and Western Europe over the last four years. In 2023, Amazon accounted for 38.7% of retail e-commerce sales in those geographies, up from 36.4% in 2019. That scale creates a powerful network effect that naturally brings more buyers and sellers to the marketplace. It also lets Amazon reinvest more heavily in its business than its peers. As an example, the company has constructed a logistics network that rivals UPS. That infrastructure supports fulfillment services for merchants and rapid delivery for buyers, making its marketplace more compelling for all parties. Digital advertising: Amazon has evolved its retail footprint into a booming advertising business. The company has a unique ability to engage shoppers and source data from its marketplace, and that makes it an ideal partner for media buyers looking to reach consumers with relevant advertising. Amazon accounts for 75% of retail media spending in the U.S. -- 10 times more market share than second-place Walmart -- and it recently became the third-largest advertising company in the world. Moreover, Amazon should continue gaining share given that retail media is the fastest-growing channel in the broader digital advertising market. Cloud computing: Amazon Web Services is the market leader in numerous cloud verticals, including compute, networking, storage, database, and machine learning services. In total, AWS accounted for 32% of cloud infrastructure and platforms services (CIPS) spending in the third quarter, while Microsoft Azure ranked second with 23% market share and Alphabet's Google Cloud ranked third with 11% market share. Rapid innovation is a big reason why the company has been so successful. Research company Gartner says AWS has the greatest breadth and depth of CIPS capabilities.\n\nTurning to the future, Straits Research expects online retail sales to increase at 8% annually through 2030, and Grand View Research believes the cloud computing and adtech markets will compound at 14% annually during the same period. That gives Amazon a good shot at 10% annual sales growth through the end of the decade, though its AI product roadmap leaves room for upside.\n\nAmazon is uniquely positioned to monetize AI cloud services\n\nSpending across AI hardware, software, and services is projected to grow at about 40% annually over the next decade. Amazon is ideally positioned to benefit from that tailwind. AWS is not only the leader in the broader CIPS market, but also the leader in the cloud AI developer services market. Moreover, the company has a robust development pipeline that is creating new revenue streams at all three layers of the AI stack.\n\nAI infrastructure: AWS is designing custom silicon for AI training (Trainium) and inference (Inferentia). According to CEO Andy Jassy, those chips have \"better price performance characteristics\" than other options. Amazon also announced a partnership with Anthropic, an AI start-up for which AWS will serve as the primary cloud provider. Anthropic will use Trainium and Inferentia chips to build future foundational models, and it will collaborate with AWS on future chip design. AI model services: AWS recently launched Amazon Bedrock, a cloud service featuring pretrained foundational models from Amazon and third-party providers like Anthropic. Bedrock allows businesses to customize pretrained models with their own data to build and deploy generative AI applications. AI software: CodeWhisperer is a generative AI coding companion that automates certain aspects of software development. That product launched in April 2023. The company more recently announced a generative AI business assistant called Amazon Q. That product can summarize text, draft emails, and surface relevant information across various data sources and systems, including third-party products from Microsoft and Google.\n\nHere's the upshot: Amazon is well positioned to monetize AI given its leadership in cloud computing and ongoing product development efforts. That should help AWS maintain or even increase its market share, which lends credit to the idea that Amazon can grow sales at 10% annually (or faster) through the end of the decade.\n\nWith that in mind, the current valuation of 2.9 times sales looks quite reasonable, and it's a slight discount to the three-year average of 3 times sales. Investors should feel comfortable buying a small position in Amazon today as part of a bigger basket of AI stocks.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Amazon wasn't one of them.

However, there's another one that can work with the right stocks: Buy high and hold.\n\nSome stocks remain great picks even after they've delivered huge gains. We only have to look at Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway portfolio to find several examples. These Buffett stocks have soared over 50% -- and they're still no-brainer buys.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) stock has skyrocketed close to 90% since the beginning of 2023. While several factors were behind the big gain, the surging interest in generative AI played a big part in Amazon's outsize returns.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway trimmed its position in Amazon a little during the third quarter of 2023. However, the conglomerate's stake still totals nearly $1.6 billion.\n\nMy take is that Buffett and Berkshire would have been better off buying more Amazon shares. Why? For one thing, the company's profits continue to grow by leaps and bounds, thanks to a renewed focus on the bottom line.\n\nMore importantly, Amazon's long-term prospects remain exceptionally strong. Organizations shifting their IT spending to the cloud (with the desire to build AI apps serving as key motivation) should provide a major tailwind for Amazon Web Services. There's still plenty of room for Amazon's e-commerce business to grow. The company also continues to expand into new markets.\n\n2. D.R. Horton\n\nBuffett didn't buy many stocks in 2023. D.R. Horton(NYSE: DHI) stands out as a notable exception. It was one of three homebuilder stocks added to Berkshire's portfolio in the second quarter last year.\n\nD.R. Horton has been a big winner, jumping nearly 60% since the beginning of 2023. However, the stock has pulled back recently due to the company's disappointing fiscal 2024 first-quarter update.\n\nI'm not concerned, though. The U.S. has experienced a housing shortage for several years that hasn't been addressed. D.R. Horton ranks as the largest homebuilder in the country based on volume, a spot it's held for more than two decades. The company's long-term prospects should be strong, thanks to the underlying market dynamics.\n\nStory continues\n\nD.R. Horton could perform better than expected over the near term, too. The company's full-year guidance for fiscal 2024 projects only modest revenue growth. However, the Federal Reserve has signaled that interest rate cuts could be on the way this year. If so, mortgage rates could also fall and provide an incentive for more Americans to buy new homes.\n\n3. Lennar\n\nLennar(NYSE: LEN) was one of the other homebuilder stocks Buffett bought last year. Like D.R. Horton, Lennar has turned out to be a good investment for the legendary investor. Since early 2023, the stock is up close to 65%.\n\nThe same factors that bode well for D.R. Horton should also help Lennar. The company expects to close on 80,000 new homes in its current fiscal year. Executive chairman and co-CEO Stuart Miller said in the company's fiscal 2023 Q4 update in December that Lennar's \"strategy has positioned us particularly well as interest rates now seem likely to moderate in 2024.\"\n\nEven with its big gains over the last year or so, Lennar's valuation looks attractive. The stock's forward earnings multiple is under 10.5x.\n\nLennar also has a little something to offer for investors who like income. Its dividend currently yields 1.35%. With a payout ratio of less than 11%, it's a pretty good bet that the company will increase its dividend in the future.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Lennar right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Lennar, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Lennar wasn't one of them.

(Westend61 via Getty Images)\n\nArtificial intelligence is now a part of our everyday lives and many of us use and encounter AI without even thinking about it. We ask Alexa to play music or check a recipe, Siri organises our calendars and Facebook, Instagram and X use the technology to decide which social media posts \u2014 or adverts \u2014 to show us.\n\nThe development of accessible tools like ChatGPT has also led to the integration of AI in the workplace. AI\u2019s ability to analyse huge amounts of data and recognise patterns allows it to imitate human function and to problem-solve, reason, learn, perceive and carry out day-to-day admin tasks. Understandably, this had led to concerns about its potential to surpass human capacity in certain areas.\n\nAI may be capable of creating images and text, hiring, predicting trends and making financial decisions, but it\u2019s important to remember its limitations. While the tech will undoubtedly bring a whole host of support and capabilities to our workplaces, it is essential to understand that it won\u2019t completely replace humans \u2014 at least not yet, anyway.\n\nRead more: How AI could help us move to a four-day work week\n\nIt still lacks something essential to nearly all jobs \u2014 the human touch.\n\nAI can't empathise\n\n\u201cAI has been a great tool to assist with data analysis and automation, but it lacks the genuine empathy and practical common sense in various aspects of work and life,\u201d says careers expert Deirdre Orr. \u201cThe ability to understand emotions, navigate complex social dynamics, and make nuanced decisions based on context and experience sets humans apart in ways that AI cannot fully emulate.\u201d\n\nEmpathy, the ability to see another person\u2019s perspective and appreciate their point of view, is a powerful tool. Research suggests that the genuine feeling and expression of empathy has far-reaching effects in our personal and professional lives, and has been linked to better physical health, the maintenance of cognitive function, happiness, resilience, resistance to burnout and better relationships.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt has also been associated with professional success, putting pay to the idea of \u2018looking after number one\u2019. In a 14-year study from the University of California-Berkeley\u2019s Haas School of Business, those who were generous and agreeable were more likely to be promoted to a position of power.\n\nEmpathy can also increase sales and investment opportunities too, as being empathic can help people better understand the motivation of clients, customers and investors.\n\nRead more: Should you use AI to write your cover letter?\n\n\u201cEmpathy and common sense are invaluable assets in the workplace, each offer very unique qualities that AI cannot replicate,\u201d says Orr. \u201cThey enhance collaboration, reduce conflicts, and boost employee engagement. Furthermore, these qualities stimulate innovation, improve customer relations, and aid in sound decision-making.\u201d\n\nEssentially, empathy softens negative emotions \u2014 something that AI can\u2019t do. Of course, this is less important if all jobs were to become automated overnight, but research suggests this is unlikely to happen any time soon. In healthcare the ability to empathise and connect on a personal, human level with a patient is crucial. (PhonlamaiPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nAI in the workplace\n\nWhile the new technology is likely to disrupt our workplaces, it will do so by taking on our admin-heavy tasks instead of replacing us completely. In part, a recent MIT study found, this is because AI is too expensive.\n\nThere are jobs in which empathy is even more important. Artificial Intelligence has been making significant strides in healthcare, from diagnosis to treatment and research. It has been rightly hailed as a game-changer, but its lack of an ability to empathise is its achilles heel. In healthcare \u2014 and particularly mental healthcare \u2014 the ability to empathise and connect on a personal, human level with a patient is crucial.\n\nFor people in distress, human connection and meaningful relationships are key components of recovery \u2014 so much so that compassion is an irreplaceable part of a therapeutic relationship. Having an empathic connection with a doctor, nurse or therapist builds trust, which can encourage compliance with treatments and help patients cope with difficult diagnoses. This is something AI simply can\u2019t replicate and even if we were to create tech that mimics empathy and compassion, it would raise serious ethical problems.\n\nRead more: Will AI make us even lonelier at work?\n\nAnd, Orr adds, there are other problems with relying too heavily on AI. \u201cIt is limited in the workplace when it comes to actual ethical decision making,\u201d she explains. \u201cMoral judgement comes from within a human, so when it's time to fully assess a situation and issue a complex decision it would be very difficult for AI to provide a response that is fair, ethical, and unbiased.\u201d\n\nA good example is discrimination in recruitment. AI can scan job applications and vet applicants quickly and effectively, making what is notoriously a time-consuming process much more streamlined. But, the decisions made by AI are shaped by the initial data it receives. So if the underlying data is unfair, skewed or discriminatory, the resulting algorithms can perpetuate bias, potentially contributing to widespread inequality.\n\n\u201cAI just can't replicate or navigate the complex nuances of various human aspects in the workplace,\u201d says Orr. \u201cAlso, AI is very limited when it comes to customer service. It can understand most simple commands and requests, but AI bots truly struggle to offer employees, customers and clients the personalised touch that is needed to provide exemplary customer service.\u201d\n\nWatch: Accenture CTO explains how AI will aid businesses, new jobs</p>\\n<p>Accenture (<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:1;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ACN?p=ACN\\\">ACN</a>) Chief Technology Officer Paul Daugherty joins Yahoo Finance for the latest installment of its <a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:2;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/live/ai-revolution\\\"><em>AI Revolution special</em></a> to help discuss the data and the ways workplace AI may effectively be incorporated into many business models to benefit workers.</p>\\n<p>Daugherty explains that the advent of AI is like nothing before, and so businesses will need to revolutionize how they approach work: \\\"We believe what's happening, what needs to happen, is companies need to re-invent work itself and how it happens.

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are among many of the tech giants due to report results this week, while the Federal Reserve will unveil its latest policy decision and deliver closely-watched commentary that could help determine the path ahead for interest rates. China Evergrande (HK:3333) is ordered to liquidate, starting a new and possibly lengthy chapter for the heavily indebted property developer.\n\n1. Futures mixed\n\nU.S. stock futures hovered around both sides of the flatline on Monday, as traders geared up for a week of key corporate earnings and central bank decisions.\n\nBy 05:07 ET (10:07 GMT), the Dow futures contract had shed 55 points or 0.1%, S&P 500 futures had dipped by 3 points or 0.1%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had added 19 points or 0.1%.\n\nA solid start to the new year for the main averages on Wall Street will likely face a stern exam in the coming days. Investors will be parsing through numbers from some of America's largest businesses and digesting influential commentary from the Federal Reserve, both of which may help clarify the outlook for the broader economy (see below).\n\nThe S&P 500 dipped by 0.1% on Friday, leaving the benchmark index near all-time highs, a move that reflects market hopes that inflation may be cooling without a meltdown in growth -- a scenario commonly referred to as a \"soft landing.\" The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite also fell by 0.4% to end the prior trading week, while the 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.2%.\n\n2. Big-name earnings ahead\n\nA parade of high-profile and possibly market-moving results are due out from a string of companies this week, including many of the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks that have powered a recent surge in equities.\n\nOn Tuesday, Microsoft will report after the bell, only days after the tech giant's market capitalization surpassed $3 trillion. Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which like Microsoft has been a beneficiary of a wave of hype around artificial intelligence, will also unveil its latest numbers following the close of markets.\n\nStory continues\n\nWednesday will feature semiconductor manufacturer Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), with investors on the lookout for the San Diego-based group's view of the year ahead for chipmaking. Quarterly figures are also due from Boeing (NYSE:BA), the embattled planemaker who has come under fresh scrutiny following a dangerous mid-flight blowout on one of its 737 Max 9 models earlier this month, as well as Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO), the Danish drugmaker behind the popular weight loss medication Wegovy.\n\nMore megacap tech firms are set to step into the limelight on Thursday, including iPhone-maker Apple, e-commerce behemoth Amazon and Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META).\n\n3. Fed decision in focus\n\nMarkets will also be keeping their eye on the Federal Reserve, as the world's most influential central bank holds its latest two-day policy meeting.\n\nFed officials are tipped to keep interest rates on hold at more than two-decade highs following the gathering on Wednesday, placing extra focus on any comments regarding the outlook for borrowing costs in the near term.\n\nIn December, the Fed signaled that it could reduce rates six times this year, fueling hopes for a cut as early as March. But several policymakers have moved to temper these expectations, indicating that worries remain that a rapid loosening in financial conditions could reignite cooling inflationary pressures.\n\nA stronger-than-expected advance estimate of fourth-quarter U.S. growth last week also bolstered the case for the Fed to hold off on lowering rates any time soon. Meanwhile, economists expect January nonfarm payrolls on Friday to show ongoing resilience in the U.S. labor market -- although the Fed will not be able to factor this particular piece of data into its latest projections.\n\nHow the Fed sees price gains and economic activity evolving in 2024 will likely influence bets over the timing of the first cut. According to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool, there is an almost 50% chance the bank will roll it out in May.\n\n4. China Evergrande ordered to liquidate\n\nChina Evergrande has been ordered to be wound up by a Hong Kong court after the world's most indebted property developer failed to secure a restructuring agreement with its creditors.\n\nThe group, which has over $300 billion in total liabilities, has been attempting to secure the deal for more than two years in the wake of a bond repayment and a series of court hearings.\n\nBut Justice Linda Chan on Monday appointed management consultancy Alvarez&Marsal to liquidate Evergrande, arguing that the move will provide some certainty to creditors. \"It is time for the court to say enough is enough,\" Chan said in the morning court session, Reuters reported.\n\nEvergrande's Chief Executive Siu Shawn told Chinese media that the decision will not impact the operations of its onshore and offshore units. But analysts have flagged that the liquidation process could be complicated and lengthy, as well as damaging to already downbeat sentiment around the state of China's property market.\n\nShares in Evergrande slumped by just under 21% after the announcement.\n\n5. Crude volatile amid Middle East turmoil\n\nOil prices were choppy on Monday, as traders fretted over increased disruptions to supply in the Middle East following a drone attack on U.S. forces in Jordan over the weekend.\n\nBy 05:08 ET, the U.S. crude futures contract traded 0.4% lower at $77.73 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.3% to $82.68 per barrel. Both contracts had risen earlier in the day.\n\nThe attack, which U.S. President Joe Biden said was carried out by Iran-backed militants, resulted in the death of three American service members.
