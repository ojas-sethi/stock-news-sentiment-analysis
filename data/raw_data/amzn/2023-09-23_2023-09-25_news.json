[{"date": "2023-09-25T23:28:04+00:00", "title": "What is Anthropic? The buzzy AI startup just got up to $4 billion in funding from Amazon as part of a colossal tech alliance", "content": "Amazon will invest up to $4 billion in Anthropic, one of the buzzy startups building a generative AI chatbot. With the deal, announced Monday, Anthropic secures a major investment from a second Big Tech company, after already receiving $300 million from Google at the end of last year. Google\u2019s investment, which wasn\u2019t reported at the time, gave Google an estimated 10% stake in the company. In its latest fundraising round in May, Anthropic was valued at nearly $5 billion, according to TechCrunch. An updated valuation was not disclosed for Amazon\u2019s most recent investment nor details about the size of its minority stake.\n\nAmazon becomes the latest major player to invest in up-and-comers in the generative AI world, after ChatGPT maker OpenAI received $13 billion from Microsoft.\n\nAmazon\u2019s deal with Anthropic is more comprehensive than just a large infusion of cash\u2014although it is of course that as well. In addition to the $1.25 billion in upfront funding Anthropic will also get access to tools for AI developers and products that Amazon is creating. These include access to computing chips, large language models, and Amazon\u2019s cloud computing capabilities under Amazon Web Services. Anthropic, which already has an AI chatbot called Claude and an established large language model, will be the latest addition to the ever-expanding arsenal of AI-specific tools Amazon is embedding within AWS.\n\n\u201cA big part of our strategy in AI and generative AI specifically is all about customer choice and there\u2019s not going to be any one solution that works for all customers for all use cases,\u201d Amazon Web Services CEO Adam Selipsky told Bloomberg TV in an interview Monday.\n\nHow does Anthropic\u2019s partnership with Amazon work?\n\nAnthropic will, of course, get a big check. Amazon will invest $1.25 billion up front with the possibility for another $2.75 billion later, for a potential total of $4 billion. Amazon declined to provide further details about the deal\u2019s structure.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnthropic will use Amazon\u2019s new AI chips, which the e-commerce giant developed in a bid to rival Nvidia, which has so far cornered the market. Trainium, which as the name suggests, is primarily used to train machine learning models. Meanwhile, Amazon\u2019s Inferentia chips mostly help run the models once they\u2019ve been built. The majority of Anthropic\u2019s work will also be done on the AWS cloud.\n\nAmazon and Anthropic had been working together on AI since this spring. At that time, Anthropic made some of its models available via Amazon\u2019s new Bedrock service, which gives customers access to AI models through a subscription. In the Bloomberg interview, Selipsky said the two companies will continue to work together to help AWS customers develop their own generative AI applications. Selipsky cited Lonely Planet and LexisNexis as customers interested in using Amazon and Anthropic\u2019s combined AI capabilities. A press release announcing the partnership also mentioned hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, the firm founded by legendary investor Ray Dalio, who has been bullish on artificial intelligence\u2019s potential to spur productivity.\n\n\u201cSo many of our customers have their data platforms on AWS,\u201d Selipsky said. \u201cAnd if you\u2019ve got your data here, you really want to have your generative AI and all the powerful capabilities in the same place.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth remembering that for Amazon, customers include both consumers and corporate customers that use its vast digital products to run their own businesses. \u201cTogether we can help include many customer experiences,\u201d Amazon CEO Andy Jassy posted on X, the former Twitter.\n\nWhat is Anthropic?\n\nAnthropic was founded in 2021, originally billing itself as a \u201csafer\u201d AI company by touting its emphasis on \u201creliable\u201d and \u201csteerable\u201d AI.\n\nAnthropic did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe company was founded by siblings Daniela and Dario Amodei, president and CEO respectively. Dario was formerly vice president of research at OpenAI, while Daniela was vice president of safety and policy. The duo left OpenAI in December 2020 to found Anthropic.\n\nAmong Anthropic\u2019s better known products is its Claude generative AI assistant that can be programmed to ask clarifying questions if it doesn\u2019t understand a prompt. Like OpenAI, Anthropic operates on a freemium model that gives users a free rudimentary version of its chatbot or a more powerful version for a monthly fee.\n\nDario Amodei has cultivated an image as a cautious AI executive. He once told the New York Times, he\u2019d rather Claude be boring than dangerous\u2014a nod to the fears that AI will potentially destroy humanity. Although like most of Silicon Valley\u2019s AI pioneers his excitement is effusive. When asked about AI\u2019s limits onstage at TechCrunch Disrupt last week, Amodei replied: \u201cI\u2019m not so sure there are any.\u201d\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nMore from Fortune: \r\n5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year\u2014all while working from home\r\nWant more for your money?

This is where exchange-traded funds (ETFs) come into play, offering diversified market coverage at a low cost. According to the iShares division of BlackRock, ETFs represent 12.6% of equity assets and 2.7% of fixed-income assets in the US. During the second quarter of 2023, the average daily trading volume of US equity ETFs was valued at $141.6 billion, contributing to 28% of the overall total trading volume of the US equity markets.\n\nAccording to one of the leading associations of regulated funds in the US, the Investment Company Institute (ICI) has observed an average decline of 53% in the expense ratio of equity exchange-traded funds and a reduction of 56% in the expense ratio of average index bond ETFs between 2009 and 2022. The industry body has cited higher intensity of competition and economies of scale as the primary reasons for the decline in expense ratios. As per the ICI, the average expense ratio of index equity ETF saw a contraction of one basis point in 2022 to 0.16%. Meanwhile, the average expense ratio of index bond ETFs also fell by one basis point to 0.11% in 2022. The widespread popularity of ETFs can be gauged by the fact that the number of ETFs increased from 204 in 2005 to 2,844 in 2022, while the total net assets rose from $301 billion to $6.48 trillion. The total net assets of ETFs were at an all-time high of $7.19 trillion in 2021. However, global financial markets took back some of their gains in 2022 due to rising inflation and global uncertainty. Overall, Equity ETFs are the most popular type of ETF, as they accounted for 78% of the total net assets at the end of 2022.

Meanwhile, SPDR Portfolio S&P 1500 Composite Stock Market ETF (NYSEARCA:SPTM) tracks the S&P Composite 1500 index that covers 90% of the US equity markets.

It\u2019s Now a $5 Billion A.I. Leader", "content": "Dario Amodei speaks onstage during TechCrunch Disrupt 2023 at Moscone Center on September 20, 2023 in San Francisco, California. Kimberly White/Getty Images for TechCrunch\n\nIn 2020, OpenAI\u2019s vice president of research Dario Amodei left the artificial intelligence company and cofounded a rival startup called Anthropic. In less than three years, his new company has grown to be worth more than $5 billion and, like OpenAI, earned the backing of Big Tech.\n\nToday (Sept. 25), Anthropic announced Amazon (AMZN) has agreed to invest up to $4 billion in the company with an initial investment of $1.25 billion for a minority stake. Amazon\u2019s move mirrored that of Microsoft in January when it committed to a $10 billion long-term partnership with OpenAI.\n\nAmodei, Anthropic\u2019s CEO, implied he left OpenAI to start his own company because had different ideas from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. \u201cOne thing I\u2019ve learned is that it can be pretty ineffective to argue with your boss and say, \u2018Your company shouldn\u2019t do X, it should do Y.\u2019 A much more effective thing to do is, \u2018I\u2019m starting a company. We are going to do X and see how it works,\u201d Amodei said during an onstage interview at TechCrunch Disrupt last week.\n\nAnthropic\u2019s main product is Claude, a ChatGPT-like A.I. text generator. Anthropic uses a unique training method called \u201cconstitutional A.I.\u201d that aims to build A.I. systems that are not only powerful and intelligent but aligned with human values. Anthropic has been a client of Amazon\u2019s Web Services (AWS) since 2021. As part of the investment agreement, Anthropic will use AWS as a primary cloud provider and use AWS Trainium and Inferentia A.I. chips to build, train and deploy its future foundation models, Amazon said.\n\nUntil today\u2019s Amazon deal, Anthropic had raised $1.5 billion in funding\u2014from investors including Google, Salesforce and Zoom\u2014and was most recently valued at $5 billion, making it among the\u00a0highest-valued A.I. startups in the world. Amazon didn\u2019t disclose how much Anthropic was worth before or after it signed the investment deal.\n\nBut Amodei said the funding amount is small relative to how much Anthropic might need for new product development and the potential revenue it could bring in. \u201cIt\u2019s all relative,\u201d he said at TechCrunch Disrupt.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnthropic focuses on enterprise customers, Amodei said, who use Claude to speed up \u201cknowledge work in professional services.\u201d For example, legal data analytics firm LexisNexis is a client. Claude is popular among financial service and legal service providers, Amodei said.\n\nEarlier this month, Anthropic launched its first consumer-facing subscription of Claude 2. The company plans to build a \u201cfrontier model\u201d that is 10 times more capable than today\u2019s most powerful A.I. and the development will require $1 billion in spending over the next 18 months, according to TechCrunch.\n\nThe \u201csurreal\u201d life as the CEO of a high-flying A.I. startup\n\nAmodei worked at OpenAI for five years, leading the development of GPT-2 and GPT-3, the precursors of the large language model powering ChatGPT today. When he left, he brought along a few coworkers, including his sister, Daniela Amodei, who led OpenAI\u2019s recruiting effort and managed its technical safety and policy teams, according to her LinkedIn page.\n\nAmodei said his day-to-day activities now consist of \u201ca mix of things that are very normal and things that are very unusual.\u201d \u201cHalf the day it\u2019s fairly normal things any startup would encounter,\u201d such as monitoring operations, hiring for key positions and talking to potential customers, he said at TechCrunch Disrupt, and \u201cthe other half can be very unusual because of where we think the technology is going.\u201d That largely involves communicating with parties outside the tech world about the risks of A.I. and how to mitigate them.\n\nIn July, Amodei testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on potential regulation of A.I. Amodei said he fears cutting-edge A.I. could be used to create dangerous viruses and other bioweapons and standard tests must be created to test advanced A.I. models before they can be released to the public.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something surreal about ping-ponging back between those two. I\u2019ve never seen an industry that works that way,\u201d Amodei said.\n\nTrending Observer Stories\n\nBill Gates Says Planting Trees to Solve Climate Crisis Is 'Complete Nonsense' What to Watch on Streaming This Week: September 22-28 10 Books With the Heartwarming Vibes of Heartstopper The Complete List of All the Stuff You Can Anonymously Ship Your Enemies Rex Reed's Top Picks from the 2023 Toronto Film Festival\n\nRead the original story Dario Amodei Quit OpenAI to Build a GPT Rival.

Autoworkers are on strike. Unionized pilots just got record pay raises out of all the major airlines. The Teamsters union wrung concessions from United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS). And union drives continue at American companies as diverse as Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).\u00a0At the same time, the federal government is spending $1.25 trillion on infrastructure projects across the country to improve roads, bridges, railway corridors, and more. Governments at the state and municipal levels are also investing heavily in construction projects. The Brookings Institution is calling this \u201cAmerica\u2019s Infrastructure Decade.\u201d \u00a0It\u2019s all contributing to a\u00a0blue-collar bull market.\n\nFord Motor (F) Ford dealership sign against a blue sky.\n\nSource: D K Grove / Shutterstock.com\n\nFord Motor (NYSE:F) seems to be doing better than its rivals when it comes to negotiating with the autoworker unions.\n\nFor one, Ford reached a new labor pact with more than 5,000 autoworkers in Canada, narrowly averting a strike that could have impacted its vehicle production. Then, the United Auto Workers (UAW) union in the U.S. announced that it would not expand its strike action against Ford.\u00a0While a\u00a0collective agreement between the two has not yet been reached, the union says progress is being made.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn addition, the resolution of bargaining in Canada comes as a relief. Without that, Ford would have had to contend with labor issues on both sides of the border. Plus, a\u00a0strike in Canada would have impacted the production of the Ford Edge and Lincoln Nautilus crossover vehicles.\n\nFedEx (FDX) A FedEx employee loads a FedEx Express truck in Manhattan.\n\nSource: Antonio Gravante / Shutterstock.com\n\nShares of FedEx (NYSE:FDX) are rallying, with UPS finding itself embroiled in labor negotiations.\n\nHelping, FedEx just reported better-than-expected financial results and raised its full-year guidance. For its latest quarter, FedEx reported earnings per share (EPS) of $4.55 on revenue of $21.7 billion. Analysts forecast EPS of $3.71 from sales of $21.7 billion. The company also said\u00a0earnings were given a big lift by internal cost-cutting, as well as events such as the UPS labor negotiations and the bankruptcy of Yellow Corp.\u00a0Looking ahead, FedEx said it expects to earn between $17 and $18.50 a share for its full 2024 fiscal year.\n\nStory continues\n\nBoeing (BA) BA stock: a blue and white Boeing 787 flying in the sky above the clouds\n\nSource: vaalaa / Shutterstock\n\nBoeing (NYSE:BA) is a major American manufacturer, employing more than 150,000 blue-collar workers. It\u2019s also\u00a0one of only two commercial aircraft manufacturers in the world along with France\u2019s Airbus SE.\u00a0Given its competitive strength and its global duopoly in the manufacture of commercial aircraft, Boeing could be a good long-term holding for investors with time and patience.\n\nGranted, Boeing has had its share of problems. Its stock was knocked lower after the company warned that a new manufacturing flaw in its 737 Max aircraft is likely to delay deliveries to its airline customers worldwide. It also found fastener holes on the aft pressure bulkhead on some 737 Max aircraft were improperly drilled, which needs repair. However, Boeing stressed that the bulkhead problem is not a safety issue. Despite the hiccup, Boeing has raised its monthly production to 38 aircraft from 31 previously.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) McDonald's golden arches\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) just said it would raise the royalty fees it charges new U.S. restaurant franchises. Specifically, McDonald\u2019s said that\u00a0it is raising the fee that new franchise operators must pay to license the McDonald\u2019s brand to 5% from 4% as of Jan. 1.\u00a0The company said the\u00a0increased royalty fee will help it to maintain its \u201ccompetitive edge.\u201d\n\nThat royalty fee hike also comes after McDonald\u2019s\u00a0beat Wall Street expectations with second-quarter financial results. Better, a growing number of analysts are turning bullish on McDonald\u2019s, which they feel is a good bet if the economy falls into a recession.\n\nCaterpillar (CAT) Image of the Wall Street Bull.\n\nSource: photo.ua / Shutterstock.com\n\nAfter struggling during the pandemic, Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) is on a tear once again. At the moment, the company is\u00a0riding high on renewed infrastructure spending by governments at all levels. That\u2019s in addition to rising demand for its mining machinery.\n\nMoving forward,\u00a0Caterpillar is well-positioned for continued growth given that most of its business remains in North America. Also, while construction and mining activity in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico remains strong, activity and demand are beginning to wane in other areas, notably China and Europe, where the economies are cooling much faster under the weight of high-interest rates. Caterpillar\u2019s positioning in North America insulates it from international headwinds.\n\nWalmart (WMT) Walmart (WMT) logo on a store front\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nUBS analyst just upgraded Walmart (NYSE:WMT) to a \u201cbuy\u201d rating, with a $190 price target. All thanks to growing strength in its online sales channel and increasing dominance in groceries. Helping, Walmart is the largest grocery retailer in America, outpacing both Costco (NASDAQ:COST) and Kroger (NYSE:KR).\n\nIn addition, Walmart\u2019s earnings continue to be impressive. The company recently raised its full-year guidance after beating Wall Street expectations for its second-quarter results. In fact, same-store sales increased 6.4% year over year, with e-commerce sales up 24%. In addition, the company\u00a0now expects full-year sales to increase between 4% and 4.5% which is ahead of previous guidance of sales gains of 3.50%.\n\nGeneral Electric (GE) Company breakups: The General Electric GE logo on a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nGeneral Electric (NYSE:GE) is\u00a0in the process of splitting into separate entities, which will include GE Aerospace, GE Vernova (the power generation business), and GE HealthCare Technologies. GE executives have said they want all the businesses to have investment-grade credit ratings when they become independent companies with strong franchises in their respective industries. To that end, GE is allocating its free cash flow to the new companies. Wall Street expects GE\u2019s cash flow in Q3 of this year to total about $900 million.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole\u00a0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nJoel Baglole has been a business journalist for 20 years.

Despite the substantial investment, Amazon confirmed it would not gain a board seat and that its stake amounted to a minority position.\n\nAnthropic, founded in 2021 by former OpenAI employees Dario and Daniela Amodei, recently launched its AI assistant named Claude. This product is viewed as a direct competitor to ChatGPT, a creation of OpenAI.\n\nThis move mirrors similar strategies adopted by other tech giants. Since 2019, Microsoft has invested billions of dollars into its partnership with OpenAI, giving its customers special access to the startup's prose-writing, image-generating technology. Google also invested in Anthropic's $450-million fundraise in May and maintains an ongoing relationship with the startup.\n\nAmazon's investment could potentially boost demand for chips powering AI. Anthropic agreed to work on developing technology for Amazon's in-house Trainium and Inferentia chips.\n\nThe deal represents perhaps Amazon's most significant response yet to challenges from smaller cloud rivals that have marketed or developed powerful AI this year. It also indicates ongoing maneuvering by cloud companies to secure ties with AI startups reshaping their industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdam Selipsky, Amazon Web Services's CEO, said the partnership with Anthropic will allow Amazon's employees and cloud customers to infuse their businesses with cutting-edge technology.\n\nThe rapid growth of the AI industry is unmistakable, and Amazon's hefty investment in Anthropic underscores its resolve not to be left behind by competitors like Microsoft. This move represents another step in Amazon's continuous expansion into the increasingly competitive AI sector.\n\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

The San Francisco-based startup also committed to rely primarily on Amazon's cloud services, including training its future AI models on large quantities of proprietary chips it would buy from the online retailing and computing giant.\n\nIn a joint interview, the CEOs of Amazon's cloud division and Anthropic said the immediate investment will be $1.25 billion, with either party having the authority to trigger another $2.75 billion in funding by Amazon.\n\nThey declined to state how much Amazon now would own of Anthropic or the startup's updated valuation, last estimated at more than $4 billion. Amazon said it would not gain a board seat and that its stake amounted to a minority position.\n\nThe news represents perhaps Amazon's biggest answer yet to challenges from Microsoft and Alphabet's Google, smaller cloud rivals that have marketed or developed powerful AI this year. The deal also shows ongoing maneuvering by the cloud companies to secure ties with AI startups reshaping their industry.\n\nSince 2019, Microsoft has put billions of dollars into its partnership with ChatGPT's creator OpenAI, giving its customers special access to the startup's prose-writing, image-generating technology.\n\nGoogle meanwhile helped pioneer this branch of AI and in May invested in Anthropic's $450-million fundraise, in a relationship the startup said is not going away.\n\nFor Amazon, Monday's deal may spell an uptick in demand, including for chips powering AI. Anthropic agreed to work on developing technology for Amazon's in-house Trainium and Inferentia chips, for instance.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdam Selipsky, Amazon Web Services's CEO, said the pact \"will help make Anthropic's models better, will help make our chip technology and our AI infrastructure better.\"\n\nDario Amodei, Anthropic's CEO, said his company \"has obtained the money in a way that allows it to prioritize safety\" and \"allows us to continue to scale up our models.\"\n\nSTILL TIED TO GOOGLE\n\nAnthropic, founded by former OpenAI executives including Amodei, is one of a series of companies building so-called generative AI, systems that can draft content as if a human created it. Anthropic has aimed to distinguish its work by training AI to adhere to moral values.\n\nAmodei declined to state if its latest financing was competitive.\n\nAnthropic is continuing an agreement it announced with Google in February, he said. Anthropic is using Google's custom chips and has planned to make its technology available via Google Cloud and elsewhere.\n\nYet with Monday's deal, Anthropic is giving a boost to Amazon Bedrock, a service that has attracted thousands of users to start building AI applications.\n\nAmazon's customers will gain features from Anthropic early, such as the ability to customize their AI. Selipsky said, \"both companies are committing that, for many years to come, future versions of Claude will be available on Amazon Bedrock, and that's important.\"\n\nAnthropic's Claude 2 is an AI model that is able to respond to particularly large prompts, setting it up to analyze long business or legal documents.\n\nAmodei said the deal \"allows us to work more closely to drive enterprise usage for Claude,\" which he said represented much of the demand on Bedrock so far.\n\nLexisNexis, a data analytics company, is working with Anthropic and Amazon to make its own legal search capabilities more \"intelligent,\" Amodei said. Other customers include Bridgewater Associates and Lonely Planet, he said.\n\nAnthropic has yet to gain the name recognition or usage of OpenAI, the startup behind the GPT-4 model and ChatGPT, which is one of the fastest-growing software applications in history.\n\nAmazon has aimed to give customers a broad range of AI models so they have little reason to look afield for cloud services.\n\nAsked if Amazon would invest in additional AI startups beyond Anthropic, Selipsky said, \"I honestly don't know what the future will hold.\"\n\n(Reporting By Jeffrey Dastin in San Francisco; Editing by Kenneth Li and Chizu Nomiyama)", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-steps-ai-race-4-070535684.html", "symbols": ["ABEA.F", "ABEA.XETRA", "ABEC.F", "ABEC.XETRA", "AMZ.F", "AMZ.XETRA", "AMZN.MX", "AMZN.US", "AMZO34.SA", "GOGL34.SA", "GOGL35.SA", "GOOG.MX", "GOOG.US", "GOOGL.US"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.997, "neg": 0.01, "neu": 0.867, "pos": 0.123}}, {"date": "2023-09-25T07:01:00+00:00", "title": "Amazon and Anthropic Announce Strategic Collaboration to Advance Generative AI", "content": "Anthropic selects AWS as its primary cloud provider and will train and deploy its future foundation models on AWS Trainium and Inferentia chips, taking advantage of AWS\u2019s high-performance, low-cost machine learning accelerators\n\nAnthropic deepens commitment to AWS, making its future foundation models accessible to millions of developers and providing AWS customers early access to unique features for model customization, using their proprietary data, and fine-tuning capabilities, all through Amazon Bedrock\n\nSEATTLE, September 25, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Anthropic today announced a strategic collaboration that will bring together their respective industry-leading technology and expertise in safer generative artificial intelligence (AI) to accelerate the development of Anthropic\u2019s future foundation models and make them widely accessible to AWS customers. As part of the expanded collaboration:\n\nAnthropic will use AWS Trainium and Inferentia chips to build, train, and deploy its future foundation models, benefitting from the price, performance, scale, and security of AWS. The two companies will also collaborate in the development of future Trainium and Inferentia technology. AWS will become Anthropic\u2019s primary cloud provider for mission critical workloads, including safety research and future foundation model development. Anthropic plans to run the majority of its workloads on AWS, further providing Anthropic with the advanced technology of the world\u2019s leading cloud provider. Anthropic makes a long-term commitment to provide AWS customers around the world with access to future generations of its foundation models via Amazon Bedrock, AWS\u2019s fully managed service that provides secure access to the industry\u2019s top foundation models. In addition, Anthropic will provide AWS customers with early access to unique features for model customization and fine-tuning capabilities. Amazon will invest up to $4 billion in Anthropic and have a minority ownership position in the company. Amazon developers and engineers will be able to build with Anthropic models via Amazon Bedrock so they can incorporate generative AI capabilities into their work, enhance existing applications, and create net-new customer experiences across Amazon\u2019s businesses.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"We have tremendous respect for Anthropic\u2019s team and foundation models, and believe we can help improve many customer experiences, short and long-term, through our deeper collaboration,\" said Andy Jassy, Amazon CEO. \"Customers are quite excited about Amazon Bedrock, AWS\u2019s new managed service that enables companies to use various foundation models to build generative AI applications on top of, as well as AWS Trainium, AWS\u2019s AI training chip, and our collaboration with Anthropic should help customers get even more value from these two capabilities.\"\n\n\"We are excited to use AWS\u2019s Trainium chips to develop future foundation models,\" said Dario Amodei, co-founder and CEO of Anthropic. \"Since announcing our support of Amazon Bedrock in April, Claude has seen significant organic adoption from AWS customers. By significantly expanding our partnership, we can unlock new possibilities for organizations of all sizes, as they deploy Anthropic\u2019s safe, state-of-the-art AI systems together with AWS\u2019s leading cloud technology.\"\n\nAn AWS customer since 2021, Anthropic has grown quickly into one of the world\u2019s leading foundation model providers and a leading advocate for the responsible deployment of generative AI. Their foundation model, Claude, excels at a wide range of tasks, from sophisticated dialogue and creative content generation to complex reasoning and detailed instruction, while maintaining a high degree of reliability and predictability. Its industry-leading 100,000 token context window can securely process extensive amounts of information across all industries, from manufacturing and aerospace to agriculture and consumer goods, as well as technical, domain-specific documents for industries such as finance, legal, and healthcare. Customers report that Claude is much less likely to produce harmful outputs, easier to converse with, and more steerable compared to other foundation models, so developers can get their desired output with less effort. Anthropic\u2019s state-of-the-art model, Claude 2, scores above the 90th percentile on the GRE reading and writing exams, and similarly on quantitative reasoning.\n\nToday\u2019s news is the latest AWS generative AI announcement as the company continues to expand its unique offering at all three layers of the generative AI stack. At the bottom layer, AWS continues to offer compute instances from NVIDIA as well as AWS\u2019s own custom silicon chips, AWS Trainium for AI training and AWS Inferentia for AI inference. At the middle layer, AWS is focused on providing customers with the broadest selection of foundation models from multiple leading providers where customers can then customize those models, keep their own data private and secure, and seamlessly integrate with the rest of their AWS workloads\u2014all of this is offered through AWS\u2019s new service, Amazon Bedrock. With today\u2019s announcement, customers will have early access to features for customizing Anthropic models, using their own proprietary data to create their own private models, and will be able to utilize fine-tuning capabilities via a self-service feature within Amazon Bedrock. At the top layer, AWS offers generative AI applications and services for customers like Amazon CodeWhisperer, a powerful AI-powered coding companion, which recommends code snippets directly in the code editor, accelerating developer productivity as they code.\n\nAs part of this deeper collaboration, AWS and Anthropic are committing meaningful resources that are helping customers get started with Claude and Claude 2 on Amazon Bedrock, including through the AWS Generative AI Innovation Center, where teams of AI experts will help customers of all sizes to develop new generative AI-powered applications to transform their organizations.\n\nCustomers accessing Anthropic\u2019s current models via Amazon Bedrock are building generative AI-powered applications that help automate tasks such as producing market forecasts, developing research reports, enabling new drug discovery for healthcare, and personalizing education programs. Enterprises already taking advantage of this advanced technology include Lonely Planet, a premier travel media company celebrated for its decades of travel content; Bridgewater Associates, a premier asset management firm for global institutional investors; and LexisNexis Legal & Professional, a top-tier global provider of information and analytics serving customers in more than 150 countries.\n\n\"We are developing a generative AI solution on AWS to help customers plan epic trips and create life-changing experiences with personalized travel itineraries,\" said Chris Whyde, senior vice president of Engineering and Data Science at Lonely Planet. \"By building with Claude 2 on Amazon Bedrock, we reduced itinerary generation costs by nearly 80 percent when we quickly created a scalable, secure AI platform that organizes our book content in minutes to deliver cohesive, highly accurate travel recommendations. Now we can re-package and personalize our content in various ways on our digital platforms, based on customer preference, all while highlighting trusted local voices\u2013just like Lonely Planet has done for 50 years.\"\n\n\"At Bridgewater, we believe the global economic machine can be understood, so we strive to build a fundamental, cause-and-effect understanding of markets and economies powered by cutting-edge technology,\" said Greg Jensen, co-CIO at Bridgewater Associates. \"Working with the AWS Generative AI Innovation Center, we are using Amazon Bedrock and Anthropic\u2019s Claude model to create a secure large language model-powered Investment Analyst Assistant that will be able to generate elaborate charts, compute financial indicators, and create summaries of the results, based on both minimal and complex instructions. This flexible solution will accelerate the more mundane, yet still involved, steps of our research process, enabling our analysts to spend more time on the difficult and differentiated aspects of understanding markets and economies.\"\n\n\"We are working with AWS and Anthropic to host our custom, fine-tuned Anthropic Claude 2 model on Amazon Bedrock to support our strategy of rapidly delivering generative AI solutions at scale and with cutting-edge encryption, data privacy, and safe AI technology embedded in everything we do,\" said Jeff Reihl, executive vice president and CTO at LexisNexis Legal & Professional. \"Our new Lexis+ AI platform technology features conversational search, insightful summarization, and intelligent legal drafting capabilities, which enable lawyers to increase their efficiency, effectiveness, and productivity.\"\n\nAmazon and Anthropic are each engaged across a number of organizations to promote the responsible development and deployment of AI technologies, including the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) AI working groups, the Global Partnership on AI (GPAI), the Partnership on AI, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and the Responsible AI Institute. In July, both Amazon and Anthropic joined President Biden and other industry leaders at the White House to show their support for a set of voluntary commitments to foster the safe, secure, responsible, and effective development of AI technology. These commitments are a continuation of work that both Amazon and Anthropic have been doing to support the safety, security, and responsible development and deployment of AI and will continue through this expanded collaboration.\n\nAbout Amazon Web Services\n\nSince 2006, Amazon Web Services has been the world\u2019s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud. AWS has been continually expanding its services to support virtually any workload, and it now has more than 240 fully featured services for compute, storage, databases, networking, analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), mobile, security, hybrid, virtual and augmented reality (VR and AR), media, and application development, deployment, and management from 102 Availability Zones within 32 geographic regions, with announced plans for 12 more Availability Zones and four more AWS Regions in Canada, Malaysia, New Zealand, and Thailand.

Besides getting access to Amazon\u2019s computing power, Anthropic will gain a financial infusion that will help it pay the huge costs required to train and run massive AI models. Amazon will have a minority position in Anthropic, the companies said in a statement on Monday.\n\nThe e-commerce and cloud computing giant has long taken stakes in partners in areas it deems a priority, including cargo airlines, a grocery distributor and an electric truck manufacturer. But if the investment in Anthropic lands anywhere near $4 billion, it would represent the largest known piece of corporate dealmaking directly related to AWS. The unit has tended to build its own products rather than relying on technology or businesses purchased from others, making relatively modest acquisitions in a market of hype-fueled, billion-dollar valuations. Amazon says its engineers, including those who work outside of AWS, will have access to Anthropic\u2019s models.\n\nAWS is the world\u2019s largest seller of on-demand computing power and data storage. But it has been widely seen as a laggard in the emerging field of computer models trained to generate text, images and other content because it has lacked both a hit product and a high-profile exclusive partner in the arena. ChatGPT creator OpenAI runs its software on Microsoft Corp.\u2019s data centers, a partnership based on a $13 billion investment that has sparked a renewal for Amazon\u2019s Seattle-area neighbor.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon executives have said that it\u2019s early days for so-called generative AI, and that more than 100,000 customers have used the company\u2019s machine-learning tools to date. Anthropic\u2019s foundational model, called Claude, was already available as part of an Amazon service called Bedrock, still in early release, that makes both Amazon and third-party models available to its customers.\n\n\u201cWe have tremendous respect for Anthropic\u2019s team and foundation models, and believe we can help improve many customer experiences, short- and long-term, through our deeper collaboration,\u201d Amazon Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy said in a statement.\n\nThe deal also represents a milestone moment for Amazon\u2019s in-house chipmaking effort, which includes processors called Trainium and Inferentia that are designed to power machine-learning applications. Most cutting-edge artificial intelligence applications rely on pricey chips built by Nvidia Corp. that can be hard to come by. Anthropic will use AWS chips to build and train future foundational models, the companies said.\n\nFounded by OpenAI veterans, Anthropic has raised more than $1 billion to date with a pitch to make a safer kind of chatbot for such tasks as summarizing, searching, answering questions and coding. The company\u2019s backers include Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, which invested almost $400 million in Anthropic, Bloomberg reported in February. Google is also an AWS cloud rival and builder of models used in generative AI.\n\n\u201cBy significantly expanding our partnership, we can unlock new possibilities for organizations of all sizes, as they deploy Anthropic\u2019s safe, state-of-the-art AI systems together with AWS\u2019s leading cloud technology,\u201d Anthropic co-founder and CEO Dario Amodei said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nPrivate Equity\u2019s Slow Carnage Unleashes a Wave of Zombies Deion Sanders Is Writing College Football\u2019s New Playbook Why Dollar General Might Just Be the Worst Retail Job in America Deion Sanders Got Shade, Then Sold $1.2 Million Worth of Sunglasses How Breville Became the Anti-Instant Pot\n\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-invest-much-4-billion-070100383.html", "symbols": ["AMZ.F", "AMZ.XETRA", "AMZN.MX", "AMZN.US", "AMZO34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.987, "neg": 0.012, "neu": 0.915, "pos": 0.073}}, {"date": "2023-09-25T07:00:47+00:00", "title": "Amazon to invest up to $4bn in AI start-up Anthropic", "content": "Amazon plans to invest up to $4bn in artificial intelligence start-up Anthropic, as the big tech group steps up its rivalry with Microsoft, Google and Nvidia to persuade AI companies to use its technology.

You can skip our detailed analysis and head straight to the 5 Fastest Growing Sectors and Investment Opportunities in the US.\n\nTechnology is indeed the epitome of growth and opportunity. Businesses continue to look for ways to integrate technology into their operations, supply chain, sales, and marketing departments. Most industries today are highly automated. You can take a look at some of the most automated industries in the United States.\n\nWith information technology, data management, and artificial intelligence combined, businesses often end up dominating the market if resources are used effectively. Speaking of which, according to a report by Fortune Business Insights, the global artificial intelligence industry was valued at $428 billion in 2022. The global artificial intelligence industry is expected to grow to $2.03 trillion by 2030 at a compound annual growth rate of 21.6%. The North American market dominates the industry, with a reported market size of $175.96 billion in 2022.\n\nSimilarly, the cloud computing industry is also experiencing rapid growth and development. According to a report by Fortune Business Insights, the global cloud computing industry had a market size of $569.31 billion in 2022. The global cloud computing industry is expected to grow to a valuation of $2.4 trillion by 2030 at a compound annual growth rate of 20%. The North American Market dominates the industry, with a market size of $401.49 billion in 2022.\n\nThe growth of the two industries indicates the potential the information technology sector holds for the future and explains why large companies like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) invested in offering cloud-based services years ago. On June 26, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) announced that the company set aside $7.8 billion to invest in the expansion of data centers in Ohio by 2030. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has created 3,500 jobs in Ohio since 2015 and added $2.2 billion to the local gross domestic product in Ohio between the years 2015 to 2022.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy is the Tech Industry Growing in the United States?\n\nTechnology demands funding and investment. Investing in the right human and natural resources is necessary to establish technologically advanced systems that are effective and efficient. The United States is at the forefront of innovation and technology primarily due to the continuous flow and investment funding from the government and large corporations.\n\nOn March 13, the Biden administration announced its annual budget set aside for Research and Development (R&D). According to the report, the Biden administration is set to invest $210 billion in federal R&D. Of this, slightly over $100 billion will be used for applied and basic research. Other than that, the government had also set aside $2.5 billion for innovative health research and $1.4 billion for the National Science Foundation (NSF) to upgrade STEM education and train the workforce in these industries.\n\nWhile government funding is necessary, support from banks and large corporations is the need of the hour. On August 24, Reuters reported that HSBC Holdings Plc (NYSE:HSBC) is set to expand its venture debt offering to early-stage startups. This project is to be done under the supervision of the US innovation banking division of HSBC Holdings Plc (NYSE:HSBC). David Sabow, head of technology and healthcare at the bank's US innovation banking unit, stated:\n\n\"We've been working to mobilize the broader HSBC innovation banking platform around to support companies from Series A, all the way through their journey. We're helping with the operating business, the international expansion, the financing needs, and even leveraging the broader parts of the HSBC ecosystem to connect corporates with their early-stage potential targets.\"\n\nThese figures explain why new startups continue to bloom in the United States. On August 15, Forbes listed some of the next billion-dollar startups that are likely to succeed. These venture-backed startups are making considerable leaps by integrating technology into their systems. One such startup is Hex Technologies. Barry McCardel, the young CEO of Hex Technologies, has raised $96 million in equity ever since its inception. The startup boasted an estimated revenue of $6 million in 2022. The company collects data about consumer behavior and then converts them into charts and graphs for further data analysis. The startup operates on a freemium business model. What differentiates this business from other companies is that the company targets a specific niche. The niche consists of people affluent in analytics but need more exposure to the complete data science skillset.\n\nNotable Names in the Tech Sector\n\nSome of the top companies leading the tech sector include Alphabet Inc.

Companies already using the Google Cloud Vertex AI service can access Gemini.\n\nLike Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) dominates the tech industry. On September 18, the company reported the launch of the M365 Copilot Early Access Program in Australia. The new program allows Australian companies to test the new generative AI powerhouse. The program allows companies to streamline all their operations. Copilot is installed in all the products Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) offers, allowing users to easily connect with the AI and use it as their assistant. To discuss the expansion of the program, Lucy Debono, Modern Work Business Group Director, Microsoft Australia and New Zealand, stated:\n\n\"Business leaders within the Early Access Program see this as an opportunity to gain a first-mover advantage in their sectors and enable greater productivity in a market navigating sustained economic pressure. We want these early adopters to work closely with Microsoft to use this technology, test it within their teams, help us to improve it further, and drive great employee experiences. This is such an exciting opportunity to see how Australian companies will use this incredible new tool to fundamentally change how we work.\"\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is another top leader in the tech space. On August 22, the company introduced SeamlessM4T, a multimodal AI model for speech and text translations. The model detects almost 100 languages and offers speech-to-text translation, speech-to-speech translation, text-to-text translation, and text-to-speech translation.\n\nInvestment in technology and artificial intelligence is important for businesses to sustain themselves.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of how Thailand is boosting its growth and quality of life for businesses and expatriates, go to 5 Best Places to Retire in Thailand.\n\nThailand: Boosting Growth and Quality of Life\n\nCommencing January 2023, Thailand has started implementing an ambitious five-year investment promotion strategy designed to attract upstream industries and advanced technologies in the region. Major companies such as Foxconn Technology, BYD Co., and Amazon Web Services of U.S. tech giant Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) have announced investment pledges worth $20 billion in the country. This proactive investment strategy aims to set Thailand well on the path to becoming an attractive destination for both businesses and expatriates, leading to a better quality of life and continued economic growth in the region.\n\nAccording to data from the US Department of State, as many as 30,000 American expats are estimated to live in Thailand, including retirees. While it is true that the growth in number of expats in the region is mainly due to affordable cost of living, there are other reasons attracting business, expatriates, and retirees to this country. A new era of economic development, as quoted by a feature article published by the country's Board of Investment (BOI), is set to initiate with the investment strategy and convert Thailand into a desirable destination for expatriates and business .\n\n\"We will use the BOI and investment to drive Thailand to the new economy.\"\n\nBOI Secretary General Narit Therdsteerasukdi.\n\nIn light of this, Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has pledged a substantial investment of $5 billion. China's largest electric car manufacturer, BYD Co., is committed to a significant expenditure of $660 million. Meanwhile, Taiwan's Foxconn Technology, renowned as the world's largest assembler of iPhones, has ventured into the electric vehicle (EV) sector through a joint collaboration exceeding $1 billion with Thai energy giant PTT.\n\nStory continues\n\nContributing to the favorable investment sentiment, Mr Akio Toyoda, head of Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM), marked the 60th anniversary of the Thai unit by unveiling the first battery electric (BEV) version of its best-selling Hilux truck in Thailand, further announcing a partnership with Bangkok-based CP Group to turn agricultural biomass into fuel for hydrogen-powered vehicles. Thailand, home to Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM) Asia headquarters, is described as a \u201csecond home\u201d by Mr. Toyoda. Pattaya City has even partnered with Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM) to establish Thailand\u2019s first hydrogen refueling station for fuel cell electric vehicles.\n\nGlobal Supply Chain Restructuring\n\nThailand has also been benefiting from restructuring supply chains from China to the Southeast Asia region. With Thailand enjoying a nominal GDP of $495.2 billion as of 2022 and boasting a highly developed infrastructure, it is more than capable of enabling production to meet the new demand. This is because COVID-19 policies and geopolitical tensions in China have led many businesses to relocate their supply chains from the country.\n\nCompanies diversifying their supply chains out of China, such as HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE:DELL), are now looking towards countries like Mexico, Vietnam, and Thailand. HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ), in particular, is shifting its production of millions of consumer and commercial laptops to Thailand in 2023 in a quest to diversify its supply chain from China. While commercial notebook production will go to Mexico, consumer laptop production for HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) will go to Thailand.\n\nSimilarly, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) will invest in Thailand through its subsidiary Amazon Web Services, helping the country become a hub for cloud-based internet services throughout Southeast Asia and improve the country's digital infrastructure. All of these investments and supply chain restructuring are, in turn, helping the country build on its infrastructure, improve financial stability, and work on its economic resilience. Consequently, these steps will help the country become attractive for businesses, expatriates, and even retirees.\n\nRetiring to Thailand\n\nRetiring to Thailand is full of possibilities for those seeking adventure without breaking the bank.

In 2022, the 32 teams that comprise the NFL generated combined revenues of $18.6 billion, an increase of more than $1 billion from the previous year according to data from Statista. The popularity and viewership of the NFL draw companies large and small into its orbit as corporations use football as a platform to promote their products and services.\n\nLuckily, the NFL is adaptable, increasingly moving into new areas such as streaming and online betting, and striking ever more lucrative sponsorship deals and celebrity endorsements along the way.

The Berkshire chairman and CEO has repeatedly expressed concerns that nuclear attack is the greatest danger to humanity.\n\nBut despite the recent comparisons between nukes and AI, nearly half of Berkshire's investments include companies linked to the development of AI technology.\n\nGiven Berkshire\u2019s track record, investors may want to follow suit.

If you want to skip our discussion on the mid-cap ETF industry, you can check out the 5 Best Mid-Cap Growth ETFs.\n\nAround 20% of the total market capitalization of the US equity market is represented by mid-cap companies with a market cap between $2 billion and $15 billion. According to VettaFi, there are around 23 exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that can be considered as mid-cap growth ETFs with a combined asset under management (AUM) of $169.8 billion. The size of the ETF industry assets stood at $7.3 trillion at the end of the second quarter of 2023. Investors often consider mid-cap companies as an attractive investment option due to their potential for significant growth, which can surpass what large-cap and mega-cap corporations offer. Moreover, mid-cap companies typically maintain a more stable and secure business model compared to their smaller counterparts. According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), 30% of new businesses cease their operations within a brief period of two years from inception. This figure increases to 45% after five years and 65% after a decade. Historically, mid-cap companies have grown to become large-cap or mega-cap companies with a heavily defendable business model. Interestingly, mid-cap ETFs have not garnered as much attention as their large-cap and mega-cap counterparts and have observed a net outflow of $106 billion in the last five years. Furthermore, the number of mid-cap active funds saw a decline between 2003 and 2018 from 371 to 301. Meanwhile, the number of large-cap funds remained consistent at 816 during the same period.\n\nAccording to S&P Dow Jones Indices, mid-cap stocks have received the lowest asset allocation historically, even lower than that allocated to the small-cap universe. Despite the prevailing beliefs and recent trends, data reveals that mid-cap stocks have actually outperformed both large-cap and small-cap stocks. Since December 1994, the S&P MidCap 400 has outperformed the S&P 500 by 2.03% and the S&P SmallCap 600 by 0.92% on an annualized basis. Some of the best mid-cap stocks, such as Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST), and Bill.com Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:BILL), Antero Resources Corporation (NYSE:AR), are now attracting hedge fund attention. Here\u2019s what TimesSquare Capital said about Antero Resources Corporation (NYSE:AR) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cNew to the portfolio this quarter is Antero Resources Corporation (NYSE:AR), a natural gas focused exploration and production company with operations in Pennsylvania and Ohio. The continued buildout of U.S. liquefied natural gas stems from utility plants switching from coal to natural gas and European demand.\u201d\n\nTrends in Mid-Cap Funds and US Equity Market\n\nIn the short term, mid-cap funds have experienced a net outflow of funds, while the overall US equity market witnessed a net inflow of $9.7 billion during the week ending on September 13, as reported by LSEG. Experts believe that mid-cap companies are losing against large-cap corporations because mid-cap companies do not have the same level of opportunity to access low-cost labor markets outside the US by outsourcing their operations. Furthermore, they are not able to tap less regulated markets overseas. These factors act as a bottom-line booster for large-cap stocks. There is also a widespread belief that mega-cap and large-cap companies continue to outperform mid-cap companies during extended periods of slow economic growth. This is because large-cap companies can cut costs more effectively through restructuring and other efforts as compared to their mid-cap counterparts.\n\nIt must be noted that mid-cap companies are usually acquisition targets by large-cap companies. There have been numerous examples of mid-cap companies getting acquired by mega-cap or large-cap behemoths in the recent past. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), for instance, has been at the forefront of this strategy as it has completed several acquisitions in the last decade. The Redmond, Washington-based company completed the takeover of Skype Technologies for a sum of $8.5 billion in 2011. The acquisition aided Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in integrating live audio and video communications platforms into its operating system and gaming console. Similarly, the company completed the acquisition of ZeniMax Media in September 2020 for $8.1 billion to boost its gaming division. Furthermore, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) acquired the devices and services division of Nokia Oyj (NYSE:NOK) for $7.2 billion in September 2013 to double down on its bet on mobile devices. The Seattle, Washington-based technology conglomerate Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) also implemented a similar strategy of boosting its digital content platform through the acquisition of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) for $8.50 billion in May 2021. The near-century-old studio had a content library that comprised over 4,000 film titles and 17,000 TV episodes. 10 Best Mid-Cap Growth ETFs\n\nPhoto by Nicholas Cappello on Unsplash\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe have shortlisted the 10 best mid-cap growth ETFs for the long term on the basis of 5-year performance.

AMZN currently lies low compared to rivals such as Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL).\n\nThe new AI feature being added to Alexa is called \u201cLet\u2019s Chat\u201d. Amazon says it should be available to consumers before the year-end holidays. Similar to ChatGPT and other generative AI chatbots, Alexa will be able to compose and send emails and other text messages.\n\nAmazon engineers and programmers say they hope to use generative AI to optimize, improve and integrate the company\u2019s suite of smart home products.

The chip uses up to 192 gigabits of memory, which means it can accommodate bigger AI models than rival chips.\n\nIn contrast, Nvidia\u2019s H100 chip supports only 120 gigabits of memory. Advanced Micro Devices is also developing its own software for its AI applications called \u201cROCm\u201d.

Since then, it has expanded throughout the country and beyond to Canada and the United Kingdom. Now, there are over 500 locations in these countries overall.\n\nMore: Don\u2019t Shop at Dollar Tree on This Day of the Week\r\nLearn: How To Get Cash Back on Your Everyday Purchases\n\nWhole Foods is still a great place to shop for organic and natural foods, but like other major grocery stores, there are certain days of the week that are better to shop at than others. On certain days, it might be better to avoid going altogether \u2014 largely due to longer checkout lines, more crowds, and potentially limited stock on the shelves.\n\nIf you\u2019re thinking about shopping at Whole Foods, these are the best and worst times to go, as well as some ways to save money and time on your shopping trip.\n\nBest Days To Shop at Whole Foods: Wednesdays and Fridays\n\nTwo of the best days to hit up Whole Foods are Wednesday and Friday \u2014 just not after work. One reason for this is that there tend to be fewer customers on these days.\n\n\u201cThe two best days to shop are Wednesday and Friday,\u201d said Melissa Cid, consumer savings expert at MySavings.com. \u201cNew sales start every Wednesday, [so] shop early and you\u2019ll be rewarded with stocked shelves and minimal crowds during your midweek trip. Friday\u2019s are a great time to shop fresh perishable foods like meats, fish, produce, and breads as the store prepares for the impending weekend rush.\u201d\n\nSamantha Landau, consumer expert at TopCashback.com, added, \u201cAt Whole Foods, Wednesday is the best day to shop. On Wednesday, the sale cycle is updated with new weekly deals and discounts. Additionally, this is the day that Whole Foods prepares fresh batches of all of their prepackaged foods and pre-cut veggies.\u201d\n\nKeep in mind that certain locations might have their own delivery days and times. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking to shop specific products as soon as they hit the shelf, you\u2019ll need to talk to your grocery manager to inquire about delivery days,\u201d said Cid. \u201cThis varies by location and local supply chain.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nInteresting: 8 Companies That Produce Costco\u2019s Kirkland Brand Products\n\nWorst Days To Shop at Whole Foods: Saturdays and Sundays\n\nIf the middle of the week tends to be the quietest time to go shopping, then it stands to reason that the weekends are the busiest.\n\n\u201cIf possible, avoid the weekend rush when you are more likely to come across empty shelves, crowds, and picked-over meats and produce,\u201d said Cid.\n\nThis isn\u2019t unique to Whole Foods either. Many retailers and supermarket chains are simply at their busiest on Saturdays and Sundays. After all, these are the days when most people are off from work and are hitting the stores for their shopping needs.\n\nYou may also want to avoid shopping on weekday evenings as more people head to the grocery store right after work to pick up food for the day or week. If you do go out during these times, you could also get stuck in rush-hour traffic or longer queues.\n\nTips To Save Time and Money at Whole Foods\n\nLooking to save more time or money at Whole Foods? Here are some strategies:\n\nPrice compare. Certain items are more expensive at Whole Foods than they are elsewhere, but you can still score some great deals. \u201cYou can absolutely save money at Whole Foods,\u201d said Cid. \u201cMy go-to item is brown eggs, which I\u2019ve found to be cheaper than anywhere else, even Walmart.\u201d Shop the 365 brand. \u201cWhole Foods\u2019 365 brand has great deals that beat [other] store brand products in both value and quality,\u201d said Cid. Plan your meals out ahead of time. Planning out your meals for the week (or longer) and creating a detailed grocery list around that can help ensure you get only what you need. It can also limit impulse buying. Plus, it can lower the chances of you forgetting something and having to come back later \u2014 and potentially purchasing more things you don\u2019t actually need. Check out the current deals. Whole Foods sometimes has deals going on that result in lower prices on everyday essentials and ingredients. If you\u2019re an Amazon Prime member, you could get even more savings. \u201cIf you have Amazon Prime, you can score an extra 10% off your storewide purchases at Whole Foods just by scanning your Amazon app at checkout,\u201d said Landau. \u201cYou should also check your email for exclusive weekly grocery deals for Prime members.\u201d See if your local Whole Foods is busy online. If you want to know how busy your local grocery store is before you go, do a quick Google search to see if there\u2019s a \u201cPopular times\u201d chart. This will give you an idea of how busy the store is right now and when might be better to go. Use rebate. \u201cCheck Ibotta and Fetch rebate apps often for special cashback deals on select products at Whole Foods, and sign up for Social Nature for possible free product coupons that you can redeem in-store,\u201d suggested Cid. Use cash back. With a cash-back rewards credit or debit card, you can earn a small amount back on qualifying purchases \u2014 such as groceries. Once you\u2019ve accumulated a certain amount, you can redeem those points for cash. \u201cSince prices have increased, you\u2019ll want to maximize your savings with your credit card,\u201d said Landau. \u201cReview the terms of your credit card\u2019s program to determine which spending categories give you the most cash back, rewards points or miles per dollar spent \u2014 and make sure to use that card when shopping for those items.\u201d\n\nMore From GOBankingRates\n\nHow To Get Free Money: 13 Proven Ways Successful Retirees Master These 7 Money Moves To Keep Their Retirement Funds Secure 3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000 How to Save $200,000 Cash By Improving Your Credit Score\n\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Don\u2019t Shop at Whole Foods on These Days of the Week", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/don-t-shop-whole-foods-170015345.html", "symbols": ["AMZ.F", "AMZ.XETRA", "AMZN.MX", "AMZN.US", "AMZO34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 1, "neg": 0.027, "neu": 0.798, "pos": 0.174}}, {"date": "2023-09-23T14:00:00+00:00", "title": "Is Amazon a Buy Now?", "content": "Over the past decade, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) shares have crushed the broader market, soaring 782%.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the streaming industry and recent trends shaping the streaming market, go directly to 5 Best Streaming and TV Stocks To Buy Now.\n\nStreaming has become an integral part of our daily lives, from watching movies and TV shows to listening to music and playing games. The rise of streaming services has been incredible, and there are no signs of slowing down. The streaming market size is projected to grow to $1.9 trillion by 2028, as noted by Fortune Business Insights. This remarkable growth is a testament to the profound impact streaming has had on our entertainment habits. In fact, if anything, the pace of change in streaming is only going to quicken, and the future is going to be even more exciting, going by some of the emerging trends and technologies on the horizon.\n\nExponential advances in technology have changed entire industries, especially over the past 10 to 15 years. For example, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u2019s Prime Video, Hulu, and other digital channels or streaming services have acted as massive disruptive forces within the media and television industries.\n\nNetflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) maintains a strong competitive edge compared to legacy media giants, as switching to streaming services for entertainment becomes more dominant. Netflix has demonstrated outstanding financial performance, with a return of 31.00% year-to-date (YTD) and 63.09% in the last 12 months. Over the past 10 years, the company had an annualized return of 24.58%, outperforming the S&P 500 benchmark, which had an annualized return of 9.99% during the same period.\n\nOn the other hand, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) has faced challenges in its financial performance, with a return of -4.97% year-to-date (YTD) and -20.99% in the last 12 months. Over the past 10 years, The Walt Disney Company had an annualized return of 3.45%, underperforming the S&P500 index.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn July 2023, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)'s CEO Bob Iger extended his contract through 2026, acknowledging the challenges ahead. Iger's concern about Disney's TV networks, which he suggested may not be central to Disney's core, highlights the industry's shifting priorities. The battle for supremacy in streaming and content distribution will undoubtedly persist, with Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) at the forefront of innovation and adaptation.\n\nEnsemble Capital Management shared a noteworthy observation about Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) in their Q2, 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cNetflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) (+27.5%): Netflix posted a great quarter supported by a positive response to its password sharing crackdown and advertising-supported service rollout. In addition, some of its major competitors have been struggling, including Disney+ which lost subscribers in the first quarter for the first time in its history.\u201d\n\nIn the second quarter of 2023, Polen Focus Growth Strategy also turned its attention to stocks like Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), further emphasizing the streaming giant's prominence in the investment landscape. In their Q2, 2023 investor letter, Polen Focus Growth Strategy provided the following insight regarding Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX):\n\n\"The top absolute contributors to the Portfolio\u2019s performance in the second quarter were Amazon, Netflix, and Microsoft. As mentioned, Amazon and Netflix are seeing their revenue growth accelerate after a difficult 2022 while keeping expense growth in check. We expect robust earnings growth for both companies in 2023 and growth rates in the mid-teens or higher well into the future.\u201d\n\nThe Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)'s CEO Bob Iger has also been actively discussing his strategy to bring Disney+ to profitability in recent earnings calls and interviews. A notable component of this plan is the integration of advertising within the Disney+ platform. Recognizing the need to evolve in the competitive streaming landscape, Iger's emphasis on advertising reflects Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)'s commitment to adapt and thrive in the evolving market.\n\nInvestor attention is now shifting toward legacy media companies like Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA) and Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA), all of which possess significant pay-TV network portfolios. Bob Iger's recent statement that traditional TV may not align with Disney's core strategy has put these companies in the spotlight, with investors closely monitoring their responses, including the potential consideration of a sale, in the face of a rapidly changing media landscape.\n\nIn light of the most recent news and industry trends, it's time to uncover the 12 best streaming and TV stocks to buy now. 12 Best Streaming and TV Stocks To Buy Now\n\nCopyright: lculig / 123RF Stock Photo\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of 12 best streaming and TV stocks, we first made a list of all streaming and TV companies in the US.

Meanwhile, management is magnifying its focus on profitability for the streaming service and moderating investments in content, which should drive free cash flow in 2024 and beyond. In our view, the company\u2019s long-term opportunity in streaming and the value of its proprietary content remain meaningfully underappreciated at current trading levels.\u201d\n\n7. Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Funds In Q2 2023: 66\n\nComcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA), an American multinational telecommunications and media conglomerate, holds the distinction of being the largest pay-TV company, the largest cable TV company, and the largest home Internet service provider in the United States.\n\nOn August 9, 2023, Argus Research, a notable financial analysis firm, issued an updated price target for Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA). Argus Research analyst Joseph Bonner, in light of his evaluation, reiterated a \"Buy\" rating for Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) and raised the price target from $45 to $50.\n\nThis adjustment in the price target indicates a more optimistic outlook for the company's performance. Investors may interpret this upgrade as a shift towards a less bearish stance on Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA), and they are likely to closely monitor the company's future performance.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2023, 66 hedge funds held stake in Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA). Among these, First Eagle Investment Management was a prominent fund, holding a total of 32,452,337 shares.

The analyst raised the price target on Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD) from $14 to $15 while maintaining their \"Hold\" rating on the stock.\n\nVenkateshwar's analysis was based on Warner Bros. Discovery's Q2 2023 earnings, which were reported on August 3, 2023. In his evaluation, he placed particular emphasis on the company's top-line performance. The analyst acknowledged that licensing revenues had contributed positively to the quarter's results, but he also highlighted the ongoing challenges faced by core media trends. Looking ahead to streaming growth for FY 2024, Venkateshwar expressed the view that it hinges on the success of implementing sharp price increases as normalized content and marketing investments decrease.\n\nLooking ahead, Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD)'s management provided guidance for the third quarter of 2023, anticipating adjusted EBITDA in the range of the low end of $11 billion to $11.5 billion, accompanied by free cash flow estimated at $1.7 billion. Additionally, for the fiscal year 2023, the company expects adjusted EBITDA to be \"U.S. DTC profitable\" and segment losses to amount to a couple of hundred million dollars.

(NASDAQ:WBD) \u2013 Media conglomerate Warner Bros Discovery was the top detractor in the quarter but remained a top contributor for the first half. After a strong first quarter, the stock price faltered in the face of near-term uncertainty around the re-launch of streaming service Max. Additionally, the big budget movie The Flash has not been a success. Finally, there was well-publicized drama around CNN management, with CNN CEO Chris Licht leaving the company after only one year, which we believe was a positive resolution. The company remains dramatically undervalued today, and management continues to make positive operational progress to drive free cash flow (FCF) growth. We believe this company has seen the worst so will be less leveraged and more strategically positioned in the quarters and years to come. Its underlying holdings are high quality businesses that will drive FCF per share growth while also being attractive acquisition candidates.\u201d\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 Best Streaming and TV Stocks To Buy Now.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n10 NASDAQ Stocks with Biggest Upside 14 Best Undervalued Stocks To Buy Now 11 Crypto Stocks with Biggest Upside\n\nDisclosure: None. 12 Best Streaming and TV Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/12-best-streaming-tv-stocks-105454539.html", "symbols": ["0VV.F", "0VVB.F", "AMZN.US", "CMCS34.SA", "CMCSA.MX", "CMCSA.US", "COMB.BR", "CTP2.F", "DIS.MX", "DIS.US", "DISB34.SA", "DISH.MX", "DISH.US", "EOT.F", "FUBO.US", "IQ.US"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.999, "neg": 0.014, "neu": 0.889, "pos": 0.097}}, {"date": "2023-09-23T10:14:59+00:00", "title": "25 Most Mentally Stimulating Jobs According to Reddit", "content": "In this article, we will talk about the 25 most mentally stimulating jobs according to Reddit. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 10 Most Mentally Stimulating Jobs According to Reddit.\n\nWhy are Mentally Stimulating Jobs Important?\n\nA recent analysis published in The BMJ suggests that mentally stimulating jobs may have a protective effect against dementia. Researchers combined data from multiple studies that examined the relationship between work factors and chronic diseases, disability, and mortality. They found that individuals with cognitively stimulating jobs with independent decision-making and demanding tasks had a 23% lower risk of developing dementia compared to those with less stimulating jobs. The studies, conducted in the United States and Europe, followed participants who were dementia-free at baseline for several years.\n\nAfter accounting for other dementia risk factors, it was observed that those in less stimulating jobs were more likely to experience cognitive decline. However, the analysis couldn't definitively establish whether job type directly impacted the brain or if other factors were at play. Further research is needed to clarify this relationship. Nonetheless, the findings highlight the potential cognitive benefits of mentally challenging jobs.\n\nAre Workers Mentally or Emotionally Involved with Their Jobs?\n\nAccording to Ardent Partners, today, approximately 40% to 50% of the current workforce consists of external workers, like freelancers, contractors, and gig workers. These workers are often not effectively managed or integrated into talent management strategies which often lead to to missed opportunities and compliance risks.\n\nThe concept of \"total talent management\" is introduced as a holistic approach that treats all workers as valuable contributors to the organization. This approach addresses the need for HR to actively manage the entire workforce due to social, economic, and legislative factors, including diversity and inclusion efforts and compliance requirements related to equal pay and misclassification.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, balance is always the key. It must be noted that when individuals are presented with tasks that are either too easy or overly challenging, they tend to redefine their job roles to make them more engaging or manageable. This tendency can have detrimental effects on organizations, as it often results in jobs not fulfilling their intended purposes.\n\nTo address this issue, it is important to conduct chartering conversations between managers and their subordinates. These discussions should aim to customize tasks to match each employee's capabilities and interests, and hence, ensure that the work remains both challenging and achievable.\n\nThe Right Workplaces for Mentally Stimulating Jobs with a Balance\n\nAmazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) are renowned for their rigorous interview processes which sets the stage for a workforce that thrives on intellectual challenges. Both companies are known to select candidates who exhibit exceptional problem-solving skills and creativity, ensuring that their employees possess the cognitive capabilities necessary for demanding roles.\n\nOnce inside these tech giants, the work culture further fosters mental stimulation. Employees are encouraged to think critically and innovate, but also make independent decisions. The dynamic and fast-paced environment at Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) necessitates adaptability and continuous learning which keeps minds engaged and proactive in addressing complex challenges.\n\nFrom a financial perspective, both Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u00a0 and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u00a0 have reaped the benefits of this approach. Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u2019s advertising revenue, driven by its search engine and digital advertising platforms, has contributed largely its financial success. Motivated and intellectually stimulated employees stand behind Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s remarkable success.\n\nThe techniques used at Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) to keep employees stimulated involves employees' tours and travel, great food and among other things, a peer to peer recognition program powered by an internal software that lets employees nominate each other for a reward for handling a work-related problem.\n\nTo read more about how Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) generates revenue through YouTube, check out our article on the highest paid youtubers in the world.\u00a0 Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) is also one of the top artificial intelligence companies in USA. 25 Most Mentally Stimulating Jobs According to Reddit\n\nlassedesignen/Shutterstock.com\n\nMethodology\n\nFor our list of most mentally stimulating jobs according to Reddit, we exhausted Reddit\u2019s discussion threads to shortlist the most relevant jobs.
