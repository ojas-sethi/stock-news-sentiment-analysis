Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy pulled off a financial double play this earnings season: generating strong revenue growth in the core e-commerce business while cutting the pace of spending. Wall Street applauded, sending the shares up about 10% in extended trading.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump Cites Self Incrimination Concern in Lawsuit Against Cohen QQQ Churns in Late Hours on Apple, Amazon Earnings: Markets Wrap Elon Musk Says Treasury Bills Are \u2018No-Brainer\u2019 China Official\u2019s Call to Save Xi\u2019s City Angers Flood Victims The Strange Story Behind \u2018Baldur\u2019s Gate 3,\u2019 One of the Year\u2019s Biggest Releases\n\nSince taking the reins two years ago, Jassy has brought a decidedly unsentimental perspective to the world\u2019s largest e-commerce and cloud services company. Under his direction, Amazon fired 27,000 people and pledged to keep headcount flat for the foreseeable future, whacked dozens of projects hatched during Jeff Bezos\u2019s tenure and put multiple businesses under review.\n\nOn Thursday, investors got a fresh look at the results. Second-quarter revenue increased 11% to $134.4 billion, the company said in a statement, topping estimates. Sales in the online stores category increased 4% to $53 billion. Amazon\u2019s cloud business, which typically supplies most of the company\u2019s operating profit, exceeded expectations and showed signs of stabilizing.\n\n\u201cThe upturn in Amazon\u2019s e-commerce business is an encouraging sign for the back half of the year that should add to topline growth,\u201d Andrew Lipsman, an analyst at Insider Intelligence, said after the results.\n\nJassy\u2019s unprecedented ax-wielding paid off, too. The company\u2019s operating expenses increased 7.5% in the three months ended June 30, the slowest rate since at least 2012. Sales and marketing costs rose just 6.5%, after years of increasing by as much as a third. As a result, operating income more than doubled to $7.7 billion in the quarter.\n\nNow, the CEO seems ready to reinvest \u2014 just as recession fears recede, and consumers say they feel better about the economy and their prospects.\n\nStory continues\n\nKeen to retain a competitive edge in its core online retail business, Amazon on Monday said it would double the number of facilities capable of getting orders to customers the same day. Earlier this week, Bloomberg Businessweek reported that Amazon is rebooting its grocery operation by offering fresh food delivery to shoppers without Prime subscriptions and more tightly integrating its Fresh and Whole Foods Market chains.\n\nThe company projected revenue will be $138 billion to $143 billion in the current period ending in September, compared with analysts\u2019 average estimate of $138.3 billion. Operating income will range from $5.5 billion to $8.5 billion. Analysts, on average, projected $5.41 billion.\n\nThe Seattle-based company is generating an increasing share of revenue from the more profitable business of providing services and advertising to independent merchants, who rent space on Amazon\u2019s website and in its warehouses. Advertising sales rose 22% to $10.7 billion and seller services revenue jumped 18% to $32.3 billion in the quarter.\n\nChief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said products from independent merchants represented 60% of all sales on the site, the highest ever, which contributed to growth of Amazon\u2019s seller-services revenue.\n\nLipsman pointed to the ad business, saying it \u201cheld up especially well this quarter, and the picture should only get brighter in (the second half of the year) with Prime Day and the holidays adding to its momentum.\u201d\n\nInvestors were particularly concerned about Amazon Web Services, the cloud business. Quarterly sales at the unit jumped 12% to $22.1 million. While growth slowed for a sixth straight quarter, the business still produced more revenue than Wall Street expected.\n\nOlsavsky said growth rates for the cloud unit stabilized during the quarter and pointed to a healthy customer pipeline. AWS has been rolling out various products based on generative artificial intelligence. Some analysts believe Amazon has fallen behind Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, which have released popular chatbots powered by the technology. Amazon denies this and says the generative AI race has barely begun.\n\nAfter several difficult quarters in which Amazon had to address overspending and over hiring, it\u2019s back to showing investors a clear path to boost sales and profits at the same time, said Brian Yarbrough, an analyst at Edward D. Jones & Co.\n\n\u201cWe think there\u2019s a nice long path here for continued growth in retail, continued growth in advertising and continued growth in cloud computing, all while boosting profits, which is a big change from the past 12 months or so,\u201d Yarbrough said.\n\n--With assistance from Matt Day.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nInfluencers Built Up This Wellness Startup\u2014Until They Started Getting Sick AI in Hollywood Has Gone From Contract Sticking Point to Existential Crisis Amazon Unveils Biggest Grocery Overhaul Since Buying Whole Foods With AI Booming, Gary Gensler Wants to Keep Finance Safe for Humans Honoring the Enslaved Man Who Made Jack Daniel\u2019s First Whiskey\n\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-gains-optimistic-outlook-fueled-203342977.html", "symbols": ["AMZ.F", "AMZ.XETRA", "AMZN.MX", "AMZN.US", "AMZO34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.998, "neg": 0.042, "neu": 0.806, "pos": 0.152}}, {"date": "2023-08-03T23:11:00+00:00", "title": "Amazon Delivers Surprisingly Strong Profit as Retail Business Improves", "content": "The results cap earnings reports by other tech giants showing improving health in a range of businesses, though demand in some areas remains soft.\n\nContinue reading", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/m/a99a72bb-1bdd-3391-9fdd-fbee71a18b8c/amazon-delivers-surprisingly.html", "symbols": ["AMZ.F", "AMZ.XETRA", "AMZN.MX", "AMZN.US", "AMZO34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.318, "neg": 0.055, "neu": 0.842, "pos": 0.103}}, {"date": "2023-08-03T22:57:00+00:00", "title": "Amazon Stock Jumps on Strong Earnings.

Shares rising after beating on the top and bottom line. The company also topped estimates for operating income and delivering optimistic guidance. Joining us now is Rohit Kulkarni, Roth MKM Managing Director. Rohit, we are seeing shares rising in after-hours on the back of these results. So what's the big takeaway for you?\n\nROHIT KULKARNI: Clean beat and raise in numbers. Fundamentals are better than expected. Amazon coming above their high end of the guidance. And 3Q outlook being-- kind of the low end of 3Q outlook is above the Street. So this is as emphatic a beat and as emphatic a raise that we have seen from Amazon in probably 18 months.\n\nSo, and the big other takeaway is AWS. The cloud growth has stabilized. That's what they have said in the letter. And that means we are seeing an inflection in cloud growth from Q2 to Q3. I believe the moment people start to digest the inflection, that's when the stock goes even higher.\n\nDIANE KING HALL: Rohit, I want to ask you, when it comes to-- when the earnings call-- when you get on the earnings call, what are you looking to hear with regard to the path and trajectory for AWS growth?\n\nROHIT KULKARNI: I think what we would love to hear is two things. One is how is AI contribution towards AWS kind of trending. Microsoft gave somewhat of a glass half-empty kind of situation there, where AI contribution started to decline for them. If Amazon provides extra color about how AI and AWS are going hand in hand. I think that should help the stock in the sentiment.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd second, I think they're already talking in the letter that AWS is stabilized. So how high can AWS growth go in the near term given the year-on-year comps are easier in August and September? I think any extra color around that, I think, those two data points on AWS would definitely help with the sentiment.\n\nThe third point is Prime Day. Prime Day was the biggest Prime Day they have had in the history. Obviously, we see that in the numbers. We see that in the 3Q guide. But just generally, how they see the state of the consumer state of buying patterns of consumers trend in the rest of Q3 is kind of assumptions around that would also help.\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: Rohit, there are a lot of concerns about that AWS growth going into these results, particularly on the back of what we heard from Microsoft as well as Alphabet. A lot of companies pulling back some of those investments. You know, I've heard you say, many times now, that growth, at least in the cloud, has stabilized. But it certainly feels like the outlook is a little more positive for Amazon in this space. What is AWS getting right?\n\nROHIT KULKARNI: In my opinion, AWS has been working on a complete full stack AI offering, which is they have their AWS AI chips, which is for, you know, your large language model training and inferencing. They have their own chips that they have probably, I would say, anywhere between three to five-year lead versus Microsoft and Google. They have been working on that over the last five years.\n\nAnd on top of that, I think AWS probably has the best data offering across all cloud vendors. So think about the first thing that anyone wants to do with the AI in the cloud, you want to get all your data into the cloud. There is a gravity of data. And that data gravity helps AWS because they have probably the best database offerings, the best data warehouse offerings across all cloud vendors.\n\nDIANE KING HALL: And Rohit, shares of Amazon are up more than 50% year-to-date. How high are you expecting this stock to go this year?\n\nROHIT KULKARNI: Again, Amazon is our number one mega-cap pick is what we have published for second half and probably heading into '24. In my opinion, I think we are at a couple of inflection points at Amazon. The first inflection point is obviously AWS, which we see. The second one, which we are yet to see, is our margins in North America and international retail. I think that's still a work in progress. But after having cleaned up their act around fulfillment, around logistics, around hiring, six quarters in a row their employee headcount has declined. That not a single company has done that in the last six quarters in a row.\n\nSo as we start to see, as we get to Q4, we should start to see retail margins ramp up. And that brings the stock higher even more from where we are right now. Obviously, our price target here is 155, but we see that grind higher given where the numbers will shake out after tonight.\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: Rohit, we have seen a big push from the company to increase third-party sellers. And we're seeing third-party seller services net sales coming through from there, 32.3 billion, about a 18% growth year-on-year. How much higher do you-- how big of a driver do you expect that to be when you think about the ad dollars coming in from there?\n\nROHIT KULKARNI: I think it's a fantastic virtuous cycle that Amazon has figured out between their fulfillment by Amazon, their Prime offering, and their third-party seller offering as well as advertising. So once sellers are onboarded, you are on the fulfillment by Amazon offering. And then you are also in the advertising thing.\n\nSo I feel they are taking away share from larger advertising companies, say, like for example Google and Facebook. And plus, they are taking away share from smaller e-commerce providers. So in my opinion, this is still something that based on their three pillars of e-commerce, which is advertising on Amazon, fulfillment by Amazon, and obviously, the Prime, that creates a moat that, probably, we are not going to see that break anytime in the near future.\n\nPlus, again, they have a new CEO on amazon.com, Doug Harrington. I think what he's been saying is that decentralized fulfillment centers has created the best and the fastest fulfillment set network that has ever existed on planet Earth. So what that means is the moment you start to get that speed of delivery, the speed of convenience, I think, yeah, it's hard for-- we are on the cusp of the next kind of big unlocking of shareholder value for Amazon. And I think we have just started.\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: Rohit Kulkarni, Roth MKM Managing Director, appreciate you hopping on today.

The company's outlook for the third quarter was also better than anticipated. Yahoo Finance Live breaks down the numbers.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n- Full Amazon earnings just hitting the wire, with earnings coming in at $0.65, beating the $0.35 a share estimate. Revenue a beat, coming in at $134.38 billion, the estimate at $131.63 billion. Sales guidance also beating expectations with third quarter range of $138 billion to $143 billion. We are seeing shares of Amazon pop on the back of that, up nearly 7%.\n\nDiane, when you think about what we've been watching with Amazon, AWS a big one, especially on the back of what we heard from Microsoft as well as Alphabet about decelerating growth. Companies sort of pulling back on spending. We did see AWS net sales excluding FS there coming in at 14% growth as opposed to a little weaker with subscription services. AWS net sales coming in about 12% versus the 33% year on year estimate that was there.\n\nIt's interesting to see also online store net sales there beating in $52.97 billion. We're talking about 4% growth year on year versus the $52.45 billion that was coming in. A number of numbers to get through here, but really, at the end of the day, the question going into the call is going to be, where does their AWS growth stand in terms of where things are moving at a time when we have seen a pullback? And then, of course, how are customers responding, especially on the e-commerce side of things, when we have seen discretionary spending go down, customers turn a little more cautious. What does that look like for Amazon?\n\nDIANE KING HALL: Yeah, indeed, but the proof is in the pudding here. They beat-- and I know we have this conversation about, is the bar lower and, you know, is it that it's easy to kind of jump over this bar? But there is strength in their beat that we're seeing. I mean, especially when you look at what both net sales-- I mean, as you mentioned, the expectations were $131 billion, just over $131 billion coming into this. Coming in at $134 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nNet income, $0.65 per diluted share. I mean, that was also better than expected. And it just shows also just the strength of the consumer. The consumer has been one thing we've consistently talked about. Is the consumer weakening? Is the consumer weakening? And now we have these larger macro conversations about, it doesn't look like it now. So it just shows by their numbers that there is strength there, and that AWS picture also showing stronger than we expected to see.\n\nAnother thing that you and I and others talked about, and it doesn't show up in the numbers in this quarter, but this would be kind of in a third quarter, the Prime Day sale. You know, they said that was the biggest day event, so we'll still be looking forward what they speak to in terms of guidance when they have their earnings call today.\n\n- Yes, certainly, and again, that stock up roughly 6% right now.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/video/amazon-stock-pops-earnings-beat-202638873.html", "symbols": ["AMZ.F", "AMZ.XETRA", "AMZN.MX", "AMZN.US", "AMZO34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.992, "neg": 0.033, "neu": 0.852, "pos": 0.115}}, {"date": "2023-08-03T20:26:29+00:00", "title": "Jeff Bezos and Tony Robbins Are Investing in a Surprising Industry \u2014 Can You Afford To Buy In?", "content": "Stewart Cook / Shutterstock.com\n\nBillionaire Jeff Bezos and personal development guru Tony Robbins both recently announced new companies with a focus on healthcare. However, they each serve very different demographics of customers with dramatically different services.\n\nSee: Tony Robbins\u2019 10 Best Cheap Cities with a High Quality of Life\r\nFind: How To Save $200 on Your Grocery Bill Every Month\n\nTrue to their other business endeavors, Bezos is aiming to bring convenience and lower costs to healthcare for everyday people.\n\nRobbins, on the other hand, has launched a biohacking start-up. Lifeforce, founded by Robbins along with scientist and XPRIZE Foundation chair Peter Diamandis and Dugal Bain-Kim, who hold the title of CEO at Lifeforce, is a \u201chealth optimization company\u201d for people age 35+.\n\nLet\u2019s compare the services both companies offer, the costs, and which one (or both) might be right for you!\n\nAmazon Clinic Brings Affordable Health Care to Your Home\n\nIn much the same way Amazon revolutionized e-commerce, Bezos is looking to do the same for telehealth. After its launch in 2022, Amazon Clinic has rolled out in all 50 states plus Washington, D.C.\n\nAmazon Clinic provides telehealth services with transparent pricing. If a provider prescribes medication, you can fill the prescription through Amazon Pharmacy with free shipping or, to receive it faster, have your prescription filled at a local pharmacy of choice and pick it up.\n\nRelated: 10 Stocks That Could Be the Next Apple or Amazon\n\nTo use the service, visit clinic.amazon.com. Choose your symptoms from a long list, and then choose your state. You will see the average wait time, plus the cost of a consultation via messenger or a video visit from different virtual providers licensed in your state.\n\nCosts are not covered by insurance and do not include the price of medication. However, you can use your FSA or HSA to cover the costs. The average price is $35 for a messaging-based consultation, and $75 for a video visit, according to the Amazon website.\n\nStory continues\n\nLifeforce Brings Biohacking to the Masses\n\nUnlike Amazon Clinic, which provides urgent care for everyday health matters, Lifeforce is designed to help people optimize their health as they age. Its customer base is not \u201cthe average adult going to a primary care doctor for a physical once a year,\u201d according to an article at dot.LA.\n\nRather, it\u2019s for health-motivated adults age 35+ who want to better understand their bodies and how they can live a healthier life.\n\nLifeforce costs $349 upfront for a battery of blood tests, and then $129 monthly for the subscription service. The subscription service does not include the costs of supplements or additional therapies. Lifeforce is not (yet) covered by insurance, although Bain-Kim told Dot.LA that he hopes it will be reimbursed by insurance providers within the next couple of years.\n\nConsidering the average \u201cconcierge longevity practice\u201d charges $50,000 to $100,000, annually, Bain-Kim told Dot.LA, Lifeforce\u2019s annual fee of roughly $1,897 is much more affordable to many middle-income Americans.\n\nMore: How Billionaires Musk and Bezos\u2019 $120M Rivalry Over \u2018Affordable, High-Performance\u2019 Internet Satellites Could Be Your Financial Gain\n\nBain-Kim pointed out that the supplements, treatments and recommendations are not \u201ctrying to be on the bleeding edge.\u201d Rather, Lifeforce seeks to bring mainstream biohacking to those who may not have previously had access.\n\nWhich Service Is For You?\n\nIf you are looking for easy and affordable diagnoses and treatments for common ailments, especially if you lack health insurance, Amazon Clinic could be the answer. If the idea of receiving antibiotics for an ear infection or a prescription for allergy medication within hours sounds useful, Amazon Clinic can help.\n\nOn the other hand, if you are curious about how factors such as your metabolism, hormones and nutrients in your body affect your health and well-being \u2014 and how you can improve these factors \u2014 it might be worth looking into Lifeforce.\n\nAfter all, according to one Zippia study, the average American household spends $297 per month ($3,564 annually) on entertainment. If you want to allocate a portion of that toward feeling better, Lifeforce might be a solid investment in your future.\n\nMore From GOBankingRates\n\n22 Side Gigs That Can Make You Richer Than a Full-Time Job Can Millennials Afford To Retire If They Never Own a Home? 3 Ways to Recession Proof Your Retirement 11 Things To Stop Buying in 2023\n\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Jeff Bezos and Tony Robbins Are Investing in a Surprising Industry \u2014 Can You Afford To Buy In?", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jeff-bezos-tony-robbins-investing-202629842.html", "symbols": ["AMZ.F", "AMZ.XETRA", "AMZN.MX", "AMZN.US", "AMZO34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.997, "neg": 0.015, "neu": 0.856, "pos": 0.129}}, {"date": "2023-08-03T20:26:16+00:00", "title": "Amazon Stock Rises After Quarterly Sales, Outlook Beat Estimates", "content": "Shares of Amazon.com rose in Thursday's late session after the company reported its latest quarterly financial results, including net profit much higher than expected, after the closing bell.

The firms identified in this article aren\u2019t cheap in an absolute sense. Their price can be quite high.

Enterprise AI is a burgeoning field that will only continue to grow as firms integrate machine learning into their workflows.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAs mentioned in the introduction, ServiceNow is not cheap in an absolute sense. At $563 a share, there are a lot of other equities that investors could buy for much cheaper. However, Wall Street expects ServiceNow to move past $600 and perhaps $700. The metrics-oriented website Gurufocus believes ServiceNow\u2019s potential returns are even higher and peg its value at $790.\n\nThe firm\u2019s Q2 earnings report, released July 26, gives investors a lot of reason to believe that share prices should continue to rise. The firm exceeded revenue growth and profitability guidance during the period, which allowed management the confidence to raise subscription revenue and margin guidance for the year.\n\nQ2 subscription revenue reached $2.075 billion, up 25% year-over-year (YOY).

The former has almost doubled in 2023, while the latter has more than tripled. It\u2019s basically become accepted that AMD is far behind its competition in all things AI and machine learning. However, the news is mixed, making AMD particularly interesting as Nvidia shares are continually scrutinized for their price levels.\n\nAn article from early 2023 noted that the comparison between AMD and Nvidia isn\u2019t unfair. It concluded that Nvidia is better all around. However, that article also touched on the notion that AMD could potentially optimize its cards through software capabilities inherent to the firm.\n\nThat was the same conclusion MosaicML came to when testing the two firms head-to-head several months later. AMD isn\u2019t very far behind Nvidia, after all, and it has a chance to make up ground via its software prowess. That\u2019s exactly why investors should consider AMD currently, given its relatively cheaper price.\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) Mobile phone with website of American software company CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) Inc. on screen in front of website.

International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)\u2019s P-TECH program, on the other hand, is enabling youth, especially those in schools, with the academic knowledge and technical skills required to excel in the 21st century.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u2019s Project Kuiper is aimed at launching more than 3,000 satellites into orbit to provide affordable broadband to communities that are underserved.

The strong private payrolls data added to signs of U.S. labor market resilience, with the nonfarm payrolls report due on Friday.\n\nInvestors also digested new U.S. Labor Department data on Thursday showing that the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose slightly last week, while layoffs dropped to an 11-month low in July. The government also said that U.S. worker productivity rebounded sharply in the second quarter, another boost to the improving inflation outlook.\n\nEURO SHARES DOWN\n\nEuropean shares slipped 0.8%, bruised by disappointing earnings reports and elevated U.S. bond yields, on course for their third straight day of losses.\n\nUK shares, however, ticked higher after the Bank of England raised its key interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point to a 15-year peak of 5.25%. The index was last down 0.66%.\n\nStory continues\n\nSterling extended losses after the BoE decision, falling as much as 0.7% to its lowest since June 30. It was last down 0.4% at $1.2658.\n\nThe BoE decision was closely watched for clues on how central banks globally will balance taming inflation and maintaining growth. The BoE's monetary policy committee (MPC) was split on the size of the rate hike.\n\n\"This split does leave a sense that the MPC itself is uncertain over what to do,\" said Stuart Cole, chief macro strategist at Equiti Capital, \"and indeed of how much of a danger the UK economy is at risk of being tipped into recession as monetary policy is tightened ever further.\"\n\nAPPLE AND AMAZON AHEAD\n\nInvestors were awaiting earnings results from Apple and Amazon that may give clues on whether the tech sector's sky-high valuations are justified.\n\nApple is expected to report the largest third-quarter drop in revenues since 2016 as sales of iPhones slow.\n\nAmazon, a bellwether for consumer spending, is expected to report a more than 8% rise in second-quarter revenue, aided by a recovery in the advertising and e-commerce businesses.\n\nIn Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.36%, extending losses after a drop of 2.3% a day earlier.\n\nStill, Chinese blue chips rose 0.9% after a private survey showed China's services activity expanded at a faster place in July.\n\nAnalysts at Morgan Stanley downgraded China shares to equal weight, given the still-negative earnings revisions and weak return on equity and profit margins.\n\nCOMMODITIES: OIL UP, GOLD STEADY\n\nOil gained on Thursday after dropping sharply from more than three-month highs in the previous session after the Saudi state news agency SPA said on Thursday that the country will extend a voluntary oil output cut of 1 million barrels per day for another month to include September.\n\nU.S. crude rose 0.79% to $80.12 per barrel and Brent was at $83.75, up 0.66% on the day.\n\nGold was steady on Thursday after data showing a deterioration in euro zone business activity triggered some safe-haven inflows, but bullion held near three-week lows on a stronger dollar and higher bond yields.\n\nSpot gold was little changed at around $1,932 an ounce.\n\n(Reporting by Lawrence Delevingne in Boston, Tom Wilson in London and Stella Qiu in Sydney; editing by Jonathan Oatis)", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-markets-shares-stumble-us-134450960.html", "symbols": ["AAPL.MX", "AAPL.US", "AAPL34.SA", "AMZ.F", "AMZ.XETRA", "AMZN.MX", "AMZN.US", "AMZO34.SA", "APC.F", "APC.XETRA", "DJI.INDX", "GSPC.INDX", "IXIC.INDX"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.382, "neg": 0.064, "neu": 0.86, "pos": 0.076}}, {"date": "2023-08-03T13:19:01+00:00", "title": "Stocks snap win streak, Anheuser-Busch earnings, Apple &amp; Amazon: 3 Things", "content": "Stock futures are trending lower this morning after Fitch's credit downgrade on U.S. debt soured market sentiment around the world, snapping a winning streak for stocks.

This is because the underlying companies provide essential products and services that are required no matter what the broader economy is doing. While they may not offer the most exciting returns, they are usually considered to be solid long-term performers. That said, there are a few healthcare stocks to dump that we will look at today.\n\nFrom an investment perspective, some potential red flags that could signal its time to sell healthcare stocks are class-action lawsuits and falling sales. Ongoing litigation can create an overhang on a company\u2019s shares for months or even years, while competition from generics or new drugs can seriously dent a firm\u2019s revenue.\n\nBelow are three healthcare stocks to sell now that are facing precisely these issues.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) Walgreens (WBA) store exterior and sign in Pompano Beach, Florida\n\nSource: saaton / Shutterstock.com\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) is racking up Opioid settlements with state and local governments totaling billions of dollars.\n\nWhile the company admits no guilt, last month it agreed to pay $500 million to New Mexico and finalized a settlement with the state of California for $5.7 billion. This followed an agreement in May to pay $230 million to the city of San Francisco and $683 million to Florida a year before that. And in late 2022, Walgreens reached an agreement with a coalition of 17 state attorneys general to pay out $5.7 billion over 15 years.\n\nThe hits are likely to keep coming and could saddle Walgreens with a huge amount of debt, forcing the company to sell more shares, unload profitable assets or take other actions that could be dilutive to shareholders.\n\nMeanwhile, in line with my previous predictions, Walgreens reported disappointing fiscal third-quarter results on June 28. While revenue rose 8.6% year over year, earnings missed estimates. And management sharply lowered their full-year earnings guidance, citing weakening consumer spending and lower demand for Covid-19 vaccines and testing. I also see competition from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) playing a role.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe weak outlook led Deutsche Bank to cut its rating on WBA stock to \u201chold\u201d and lower its price target to $34 from $46.\n\nJohnson & Jonson (JNJ) jnj healthcare stocks\n\nSource: Raihana Asral / Shutterstock.com\n\nSpeaking of paying out billions of dollars in settlements, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) in April proposed paying at least $8.9 billion to settle thousands of lawsuits alleging the company\u2019s talc-containing powders caused cancer.\n\nHowever, that plan may be in jeopardy. For the second time, a court has rejected the company\u2019s efforts to have its LTL Management subsidiary, which was created to handle the talc litigation, file for bankruptcy protection.\n\nAlthough the company has said it will appeal the latest ruling, a Bank of America analyst warned that Johnson & Johnson will likely have to fight individual lawsuits, which could prove much more costly. And, according to a Morgan Stanley analyst, \u201cthe talc litigation remains an overhang on the stock,\u201d\n\nJNJ\u2019s forward price-earnings ratio of 15.8 is far too high given the huge litigation overhang.\n\nAbbVie (ABBV) Closeup of AbbVie (ABBV) building corporate office, an American biopharmaceutical company with its headquarters in Lake Bluff, Illinois, USA\n\nSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn a previous column, I noted that AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) was struggling with the loss of exclusivity on its best-selling biologic treatment, Humira, with U.S. sales declining 26% year over year in the first quarter.\n\nWhile the company\u2019s recently released second-quarter results came in better than expected, Humira revenue continued to decline, falling by 26% in the U.S. and 25% globally. Overall revenue declined as well, falling nearly 5% to $13.9 billion despite beating estimates. Moreover, AbbVie posted weaker-than-expected sales of its newer psoriasis drug Skyrizi and autoimmune disorder treatment Rinvoq.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that while Botox sales for both cosmetic and therapeutic use beat estimates, there\u2019s a new product that could be coming for Botox\u2019s lunch. Revance Therapeutics\u2019 (NASDAQ:RVNC) DAXXIFY was recently approved for the treatment of wrinkles and has been shown to work faster and last longer than Botox.\n\nWith competition heating up on multiple fronts, put ABBV on your list of healthcare stocks to dump.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer\u00a0did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nLarry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 15 years.

The Nasdaq tumbled by 2.2% on Wednesday - reversing more than half of July's gains in one fell swoop - and futures point to more pain ahead, with questions about whether the big tech rally - the tide that floated most equity markets' boats - can be sustained.\n\nApple is likely to report a dip in iPhone sales in its April-June quarter, as shoppers held out for a new model in a slow economy. This will shift investors' focus to the use of artificial intelligence to augment Apple's growth.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon.com is expected to deliver a more than 8% rise in second-quarter revenue, aided by a recovery in the advertising and e-commerce businesses and offset by weakness in its Amazon Web Services cloud unit.\n\nBoth will also give a fresh sense of how retail demand is shaping up - tying in closely with a raft of labour market data due out today, including jobless claims, second-quarter productivity and unit labour costs, which all pave the way for Friday's big non-farm payroll release. Plus - there are PMIs, and final durable goods orders to round off the day.\n\nBack to Europe, where the Bank of England is facing a knife-edge decision on whether to hike UK rates by 25 basis points or 50 basis points in what would be the 14th increase in a row.

Victor?\n\nStory continues\n\nVictor J. Coleman\n\nThanks, Laura. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining our call. During the second quarter, we worked diligently to position Hudson Pacific optimally as we continue to navigate the unprecedented confluence of an unfavorable macroeconomic environment, the lingering impacts of remote work and most recently, a historic and prolonged studio union strike.\r\nOffice fundamentals across the West Coast markets remain challenged in the second quarter with gross leasing either flat or decelerating quarter-over-quarter, sublease activity either stable or rising and negative net absorption in all of Vancouver. \r\nAs expected, studio production in Los Angeles slowed significantly, with shoot days in the quarter falling 60% to 70% year-over-year for TV comedies and dramas, and 20% to 25% across film, unscripted TV commercials and photo shoots.\r\nOur focus in this environment remains on occupancy preservation and expense reductions, both at the corporate level and within our office and studio portfolios as well as proactively managing our balance sheet. Mark and Harout will be discussing our progress on all these fronts in detail. But beyond today's challenges are a variety of bright spots emerging that have the potential to shift the dynamics around our business and provide for significant upside and opportunity specific to Hudson Pacific as we move to 2023 and beyond.\r\nOn the office front, according to a recent JLL study, the broader U.S. office market is starting to show some signs of recovery. To date, the West Coast has lagged due to big tech rightsizing and tenants broadly staying as offensive, but with mounting data pointing to historic declines in innovation, productivity and human capital development, big tech has taken notice.\r\nThe 10 largest tech companies now have concrete hybrid attended policies impacting most of the workforce with the focus shifting into enforcement. These policy changes are starting to make positive contribution to Hudson Pacific's portfolio. As a sign of reintegration year-to-date parking revenue was up in our portfolio 18% compared to last year, including 25% in San Francisco and 15% in Seattle, where Amazon returned to work May 1.\r\nMore recently, Amazon asked employees to move closer to team hubs or apply for new jobs within the company or they will be considered to have voluntarily resigned. Furthermore, office demand increased quarter-over-quarter in both Seattle and in the Bay Area, increasing 18% in Seattle, 25% in San Francisco and 11% across the Peninsula and Silicon Valley.\r\nAs we've communicated in the past, upon reintegration, tenants often realize that they don't have enough workspace or conference rooms to comfortably accommodate employees on peak days. And given the growth in tech workforce through the pandemic for paying tenants, even net of layoffs, we're conservatively estimating a 45% increase in headcount, reintegration could begin to place expansionary pressures specific to our tenants and our markets.\r\nCouple this with the slowing of new office deliveries and accelerated conversions of older office space assets to non-office space uses and we will see vacancy rates begin to turn as we approach year-end. We continue to believe in our markets driven by tech and media, and we're going to provide a significant growth for long term. Although in its infancy, AI promises a wave of innovation and growth not seen since the advent of the Internet or the smartphone.\r\nOnce again, the Bay Area, more specifically San Francisco, is the cradle for this groundbreaking industry and our portfolio is well located to benefit from its growth. VC funding to generate AI in the first 5 months of the year grew 650% in the city with companies there garnering 90% of the global AI-related funding. This is translating into office demand, and there are currently 9 requirements, totaling 870,000 square feet in the city.\r\nWe're optimistic AI and relative service industry growth will begin to alleviate the lack of large square footage requirements and serve as a catalyst for sustained, positive net absorption, especially in the Bay Area. Now turning to our studios. While the directors reached a new contract in June, the actors joined the writers on strike in mid-July. And this is the first time since the 1960s that both unions have been on strike simultaneously, and that strike lasted 22 weeks.\r\nWe're hopeful all parties are going to reach a fair agreement soon, although it appears currently, they remain far apart on important issues like streaming residuals, AI and writers' rooms. The simultaneous strikes do mean that previously written production activity that still could be filmed is now on pause. \r\nHowever, we're 9 weeks into the strike relative to an average strike of 14 weeks, and we continue to expect a significant ramp in production post-strike likely experience following COVID, but it's going to take time to fully reengage. And while studios have strategically spread out new releases, they could face significant shortfalls in 2024 if production isn't up and running before the fall. \r\nNetflix, as an example, recently affirmed its intent to maintain content spend through 24 at levels in line with 2022, albeit with some lumpiness post-strike similar coming out of COVID. Comcast, too, noted a relative increase in content spend likely in '24 and with subscriber growth and engagement across multiple broadband applications trending up, the underlying demand drivers for production remains strong.\r\nA strike of this magnitude, while impactful, is rare and has historically proven to be relatively short term in nature. Over the first half of the year, we've made significant enhancements to our studio cost structure, These equated to a $12 million annual savings around labor and fixed operating expenses as well as another $15 million of savings attributable to deferred capital expenditures.\r\nWhile we'll continue to evaluate additional operating and capital adjustments, we'll do so in a manner that weigh short-term cost savings against capitalizing on long-term value creation. Not all industry players have the ability to make this trade-off, which could present a compelling opportunity for us post-strike. \r\nWe'll also be able to fully capitalize on the economies of scale from our now fully integrated service acquisitions post-strike, and we expect these synergies to result in approximately $15 million of additional annual NOI in a normal operating environment.\r\nSo despite these current challenges, we've thus far, been able to navigate the ever-changing landscape in a matter which speaks to the well-located portfolio we've assembled, our diversified asset classes and the fortitude and experience of the entire Hudson Pacific team. And we understand this was going to take time to overcome, but we believe in our strategy and our long-term positioning sets us up to generate even stronger results in the coming quarters. \r\nWith that, I'm going to turn it over to Mark.\n\nMark T. Lammas\n\nThanks, Victor. We have signed approximately 50 office leases, roughly 50% new deals, totaling just over 400,000 square feet in the quarter. The average lease size was approximately 7,000 square feet, and 50% of that activity was in the San Francisco, Bay Area. Small and midsized tenants in tech and other industries continue to drive the preponderance of activity across our markets. \r\nGAAP and cash rents were approximately 4% and 8% lower, respectively, on backfill and renewal leases with a change largely driven by a few midsized leases, both new and renewal across the Peninsula and Silicon Valley and in Vancouver.\r\nOur in-service portfolio ended the quarter at 87% leased, off about 170 basis points compared to first quarter, due primarily to the move-out of midsized tenants in those same markets. Our leasing economics improved across the board quarter-over-quarter with net effective rents, up close to 9% to $44 per square foot. Tenant improvement and leasing commission costs improved close to 50%, down to $6 per square foot per annum and lease term increased by 6 months or 13% to 48 months.\r\nIn terms of our 2 larger 2023 expirations, we're still negotiating a renewal of our 140,000 square foot tenant in Seattle at Met Park North, whose lease expires in late November. We're in discussions with 2 requirements that could potentially partially backfill the 469,000 square foot block lease at 1455 Market in San Francisco, which expires at the end of September, one for approximately 25,000 square feet, the other for approximately 275,000 square feet with additional tenant interest behind these.\r\nIn regard to our remaining 2023 expirations overall, which were about 5% below market, we have 50% coverage, that is deals and leases, LOIs or proposals with another 5% in discussions. Outside of the 2 large expirations I mentioned, the average expiring lease size is roughly 5,000 square feet. We're staying creative and flexible as we work to boost occupancy that even at the growing number of tenants commit to a 3- to 5-day in-office schedule thus far, they continue to transact very slowly.\r\nOur current leasing pipeline totals 2 million square feet, slightly above our last call, even with continued leasing and that pipeline includes over 285,000 square feet of deals and leases. We also have close to 1.2 million square feet of tours across our portfolio, roughly on par with this time last year, although down from last quarter. We did see an increase in both aggregate and average square footage of requirements for our assets across the Peninsula and Silicon Valley.\r\nThis coincides with the rise in early interest we have seen more broadly in the Bay Area and Seattle, even at the timeline for getting leases across finish line remains unpredictable. Turning to the studios. Our in-service studio stages remained well leased at 95.7% on a trailing 12-month basis and 94.1% on a trailing 3-month basis due to the preponderance of long-term greater than 1-year leases.\r\nOn a trailing 3-month basis, we actually experienced a 490 basis point increase in lease percentage at our Quixote studios. This was largely due to the commencement of a handful of long-term leases on our Central Valley and recently delivered North Valley facilities as well as a general influx of short-term non-strike impacted production, such as commercials and photoshoot.\r\nThis activity led to an additional $1 million of rental and lighting and grip revenue quarter-over-quarter at our Quixote Studios. However, revenue from pro supplies, transportation and other services was off by approximately $4 million in aggregate, even as we still had activity from non-strike impacted production, such as music festivals and other large-scale events.\r\nThat said, we expect these service-related categories are likely to be further impacted given seasonality and the expanded strike as long as it continues. Throughout our portfolio, we're continuing to limit capital improvements until we have certainty around demand. This includes staying conservative on new developments. We do, however, have 2 in-process developments close to completion.\r\nWe're on track to deliver our state-of-the-art Sunset Glenoaks studio in Los Angeles by year-end as expected, pending receipt of Department of Water and Power permits. We've continued to tour major production companies despite the strike. We anticipate leveraging a more traditional show-by-show sales model or at least a portion of the facility, which we will be able to execute on to the fullest extent, post-delivery.\r\nThere is no directly competitive supply for this project, which has a delivery date potentially quite well timed to capture pent-up demand, post-strike. In Seattle, Washington 1000 is also on track and should deliver in the first quarter of next year. While we expect even greater interest once the project is complete, we're already in early discussions with 3 tenants each with requirements over 100,000 square feet.\r\nAs Victor mentioned, Amazon's push earlier this year to bring employees back at least 3 days a week and more recently telling workers to return to its main hub has accelerated return to work for many local businesses. Washington 1000 will be one of the nicest buildings in the city and is the only new product of its kind under development. Our all-in basis is only $640 per square foot, representing as much as a 30% to 40% discount to comparable trade.\r\nAnd now I'll turn it over to Harout.\n\nHarout Krikor Diramerian\n\nThanks, Mark. Our second quarter 2023 revenue was $245.2 million compared to $251.4 million in the second quarter of last year, primarily due to Qualcomm and NFL, Skyport Plaza and 10900-10950 Washington, respectively. \r\nThe sales of office properties, 6922 and Skyway Landing. Our second quarter FFO, excluding specified items, was $34.5 million or $0.24 per diluted share compared to $74.6 million or $0.51 per diluted share a year ago. Specified items in the second quarter consisted of transaction-related income of $2.5 million or $0.02 per diluted share, which includes lowering of accruals for future earnouts related to our Zio Studio Services acquisition.\r\nPrior period property tax reimbursement of $1.5 million or $0.01 per diluted share, deferred tax asset write-off expense of $3.5 million or $0.02 per diluted share and a gain on debt extinguishment, net of taxes of $7.2 million or $0.05 per diluted share.\r\nPrior year second quarter specified items consisted of transaction-related expenses of $1.1 million or $0.01 per diluted share and prior period property tax expense of $500,000 or $0.01 per diluted share. The year-over-year decrease in FFO is attributable to the aforementioned office tenant move-outs and asset sales as well as higher studio production, higher studio operating expenses associated with Quixote acquisition and increased interest expense.\r\nOur second quarter AFFO was $31.1 million or $0.22 per diluted share compared to $60.3 million or $0.41 per diluted share, with a decrease largely attributable to the aforementioned items affecting FFO. Our same-store cash NOI grew $127.6 million, up 4.7% from $121.9 million with same-store cash OpEx NOI up 5.1%, largely driven by significant office lease commencements at One Westside and Harlow. \r\nDuring the second quarter, we repaid the Quixote note for $150 million, a $10 million discount on the principal balance with funds from our unsecured revolver financing -- revolving credit facility. At the end of the quarter, we had $581.2 million of total liquidity comprised of $109.2 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and $472 million of undrawn capacity on our unsecured revolving credit facility. \r\nWe have additional capacity of $122.4 million under our One Westside and Sunset Glenoaks construction loan. At the end of the second quarter, our company's share of net debt to the company's share of undepreciated book value was 38.7% and 85.3% of our debt was fixed or capped. We remain focused on delevering. This quarter, our Board reduced our quarterly common stock dividend to $0.125 per share, which resulted in additional $17.9 million of cash flow savings this quarter. \r\nWe also continue to selectively explore asset sales. We currently have 3 deals under contract, including 2 office assets and one land parcel, which could collectively generate over $100 million in gross proceeds within the next several months.\r\nWe're also in negotiations to sell 2 more office assets, the pricing and timing of which are under discussion. Regarding our upcoming maturities, we only have one small maturity remaining in 2023. Our $50 million private placement note is due next month, with lower pay with our line of credit. We have 2 maturities in 2024. \r\nBlackstone is leading discussions around the extension of our Bentall Centre loan, which matures in July 2024, of which our 20% ratable share is $100.5 million.\r\nWe've received indicative terms and are now formally commencing discussions around refinancing our One\r\nWestside/Westside Two loan, which matures in December 2024. And of which our 75% ratable share is $243.5 million. As per 2025, 96% of our indebtedness does not mature until the final 2 months of the year, and 3 of our 4 2025 maturities comprising nearly 2/3 of the maturing amount are secured by high-quality assets, 1918, Element LA and Sunset Glenoaks. \r\nThe first 2 of which have high-credit single tenant occupancy with the remaining lease terms into 2030. Sunset Glenoaks should be stabilized and fully operational state-of-the-art studio campus before its 2025 maturity. Our fourth and final 2025 maturities consist of a $259 million prior placement loan that matures in December 2025. While this is still nearly 2.5 years out, we're focused on ensuring that we have capital available ahead of repayments.\r\nTurning to outlook. Due to continued uncertainty around the duration of the studio union-related strikes, we're continuing to withhold our 2023 FFO outlook and studio-related assumptions, while providing certain assumptions related to our office outlook, including reaffirming and office same-store cash NOI growth projection range from 1% to 2%.\r\nThis range includes the impact of a block lease expiration in September 2023, but does not include any of the aforementioned potential dispositions, we continue to expect FFO to be negatively impacted as long as the strike persists. As always, our 2023 outlook excludes the impact of any opportunistic and not previously announced acquisitions, dispositions, financings and capital market activity.\r\nNow we're happy to take your questions. Operator?\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) \r\nOur first question today comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.\n\nAlexander David Goldfarb\n\nSo two questions. First, it sounds like the sales so far not contemplating One Westside. I don't know if One Westside is in the potential to additional for sale. But Harout, when you think about all the assets that you guys may sell, what is the NOI impact that we should think about? And then more to Victor's opening comment on corporate expense, if you're selling a bunch what does this mean about the need to reduce the cost structure of the company overall?\n\nHarout Krikor Diramerian\n\nSo let me answer the first question, which is we're not going to provide any NOI detail yet, primarily because the sales are uncertain. And once we have confirmation of the sales and feel confident we will share all the relevant details around them. So doing that is not appropriate at this time. \r\nAs far as the G&A goes, I think we said before, we constantly look for ways to reduce our costs and reevaluate them. And depending on the sales and the impact, which will also garner our ability to reevaluate G&A. So they're always being evaluated and thought through.\n\nAlexander David Goldfarb\n\nOkay. The second question is on Hollywood. Clearly, I mean, you guys benefit from owning independent studios, which is good. But when we think about some of the headlines we read, Disney and others who are talking about trouble with their full -- their screen productions or streaming services, how do you weigh like over investment in streaming or ways that Hollywood may retrench after some tough goes with the resurge demand once the strike ends?\r\nJust trying to figure out, are we back to the races? Or is Hollywood reconsidering how much it puts into its production investments, just given some of the headlines we've read recently?\n\nVictor J. Coleman\n\nSo Alex, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, I mean, it's -- so far, what we found between the bigger streaming entities to date, they are on budget, at least as we know through '24 to spend at or more than their run rate has been in the past. And that's been, Netflixes and Apples and Amazons and Disneys and Comcasts, tone to date. I think it's approximately a 2% increase year-over-year.\r\nSo that, I believe, will probably be greater given the fact that they're not spending the money currently today because they're on strike. So you're going to have a massive ramp up. After that, I believe we feel from what the industry is looking at that we've always mentioned that there will be some form of consolidation whatever that consolidation looks like, we don't know. \r\nI don't think it's going to impact the stage use and the production use because there is still a very limited number of stages in demand, in peak times are much higher than the stages that are available.\r\nJeff, do you have any comments to that?\n\nJeff Stotland\n\nNo. The only thing I would add, Alex, is that what's clear with all the streamers is that original production drives a lot of subscriber growth, and it also mitigates their churn. So it's a key economic ingredient into their playbooks. Even if consolidation happens, they all know that they have to invest in original content production. And hopefully, obviously, we'll benefit from that.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo.\n\nBlaine Matthew Heck\n\nJust to follow up on the sales, Victor. You guys have talked openly about evaluating dispositions recently and that there are no sacred cows within the portfolio. I mean Harout's commentary was helpful, but just more generally, can you talk about what you've learned about the investment sales market throughout this process whether there's more interest in certain segments of the market? And just as you've gone through the process, whether the composition in the bucket of assets, up for disposition, has changed based on what you've learned?\n\nVictor J. Coleman\n\nYes. I think, listen, we've -- the 3 assets that we have under contract right now are, as we mentioned, 2 individual assets and one parcel of land. The demand for those were relatively high on smaller user or owner user or family office-type investors. The other couple of assets that we're working on right now, I think, have a makeup of more of a institutional play change of use play. And I think that the drive that we're looking at right now.\r\nListen, as Harout said, we're not going to get into identifying the assets in the open marketplace. I believe that we have not explored true institutional ownership sales for large assets at this time, not to say that, that won't be something we look out in the future, but that's not part of the game plan and the assets that we're talking about right now.\r\nAnd so I think the bottom line is the activity is relatively good. Clearly, financing around those assets is the hurdle. And so the size of the assets from our standpoint and the type of buyer is going to be identified based on the access to liquidity and capital.\n\nBlaine Matthew Heck\n\nAll right. Great. That's helpful color. And then just taking a little bit of a step back on the studios, Victor, can you just talk a little bit more about any insight you have into the negotiations going on related to the writers and actors strikes and just what your best guess is or maybe even what you're hearing from any insiders you're talking to on how long these strikes could last kind of based on the current state of negotiation?\n\nVictor J. Coleman\n\nWell, listen, I'll take the first part, initially. I mean, listen, what we're hearing is there's -- as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, there are a few issues on the table that are hurdles that they're going to have to try to figure out writers' rooms, the issue, obviously, in AI, which is an undeterminable issue and a new issue for all parties. And then the residual issue are the big issues.\r\nI think the dollar issues and the issues around health care and all the perks around that are pretty much agreed to. A couple of things. The fact that it's at the table, I believe, helps the process because you've got now another constituent with thousands of people now involved that are more than the 3,000 writers that were involved in the past. So hopefully, that will set a precedent on some of this.\r\nReal time, we just heard last night, they're going back to the table, Friday. The writers are they have not been at the table, I believe, for 1.5 months or so. So that's a good sign. In terms of what we're hearing on the ground, we are -- as I had mentioned in the past, we don't have a seat on the table. We obviously have a lot of constituents around that are giving us information.\r\nIt could start in a heated conversation to hopefully settle something out as early as September and maybe as late as year-end. But I think as every day goes by, Blaine, we're all hugely aware of the [trapnell] around just the industry in general and all the residual businesses that are getting affected. \r\nAnd it will start to feel fairly painful for these residual companies and employees and individuals that work in the industry, and it will be damaging. And I think everybody is very cognizant of that. And hopefully, we'll try to get to some resolution quicker than we all anticipate.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank.\n\nNicholas Philip Yulico\n\nI guess just going back to the asset sales, is there anything you can provide us in terms of a view of, if you get a certain level of asset sales done, this year, what that's going to do to improve your debt-to-EBITDA metric, which is -- went up again this quarter?\n\nMark T. Lammas\n\nSo addressing that is a little bit outside the range of what we want to talk about right now. But ultimately, it will improve it over the long term, which is kind of our main point, which is we're going to delever. And that's kind of the focus that we have, and we use different tools to do so.\r\nSo not only debt to EBITDA, but also the covenant calculations, all those things, we have a very strong Ion, and we're projecting out. In fact, this quarter was in line with our projections, and we're not in a risk of breaking any of them. But like we said earlier, the delevering is a high priority for the company.\n\nVictor J. Coleman\n\nYes. And Nick, just to add to that, the assets that were in escrow or under contract with and the other 2 we're talking about and then the next sort of tiers that we're looking at, none of those assets currently have debt. So effectively, all that -- all the cash flow -- I'm sorry, all the proceeds from the sale will go to pay down current debt. So we're not replacing -- we're not getting rid of existing encumbered debt on assets in any asset at this stage. So it's all going to be very helpful.\n\nHarout Krikor Diramerian\n\nAnd just to touch upon the net debt to EBITDA -- sorry, to address our EBITDA comment, it's being artificially reduced by the strike. And so it doesn't really reflect a normalized net debt to EBITDA as a result of the strike. And so it is being, like I said, artificially being reduced or increased, I guess.\n\nNicholas Philip Yulico\n\nWell, and I guess I just -- I wasn't sure if there was any specific target you're trying to get to on that metric, realizing that the EBITDA for the studio business, there's uncertainty about how long that could be under pressure. You also have some move out still on the back half of the year, that hasn't been released. So I wasn't sure if you just -- there was a sort of plan in place where you have a target and you think that the dispositions can get you to that target?\n\nMark T. Lammas\n\nYes, there's a plan in place. The plan is get it lower. And we're doing that through these announced disposition goals. I'll add to the comments that Harout and Victor have already shared. One of the asset sales is land. So that's 100% accretive to debt to EBITDA because there's no EBITDA associated with it and it goes all to debt reduction. So the plan is to get it lower. We have always said that we want to be below 7x debt-to-EBITDA. \r\nWe understand that there are tenants rolling. There's other areas impacted like the studio and the strike things we don't control. But everything we can control, we are laser-focused on following through with in -- with the goal of getting that metric -- improving that metric.\n\nNicholas Philip Yulico\n\nOkay. And then just one other question, if I could, on Silicon Valley and thinking about your portfolio there. And I think, historically, there was talk that the portfolio would benefit at times from just ancillary services supporting the large tech community there. And I guess I'm just trying to understand better the dynamic right now where we all hear that large tech is more on hold with leasing.\r\nAnd I'm not sure if that's also impacting some of the kind of ancillary companies that support tech. Is that also sort of affecting that tenant base as well? Or is it more that just large tech is slowing in Silicon Valley?\n\nVictor J. Coleman\n\nI think it's not affecting as much as I think we would have thought it would, Nick, to be candid with you because as you could see by our numbers, the majority of leases that we're doing in the Peninsula and the Valley are smaller tenants. I mean we've got a handful of tenants in the 50,000 square foot range, but the majority of those tenants are 5 to 20. \r\nAnd so -- and as you can see by our numbers this quarter and the number of deals we've done, there's a lot of activity in the Peninsula and the Valley. Also, the physical occupancy is in the Valley and the Peninsula has increased dramatically, and that's converted to more people looking at space and touring and the likes of that. Art, do you want to comment on that?\n\nArthur X. Suazo\n\nYes, Nick, the answer is we are -- as tenants are starting to discover how they're going to utilize space, right? So return to office is really kind of on the forefront and they're enforcing these return to office mandates, They're discovering how much space they're going to need to rightsize. We're seeing those rightsizes cut both ways, but we are seeing tenants coming back and looking for more space. That's going to affect both the large and the smaller users. So it's going to play all the way through.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Michael Griffin with Citi.\n\nMichael Anderson Griffin\n\nI wondered if you could expand on what you mentioned in the release about extended times for decisions to be made on leases. Is this just a function of space takers more hesitant to take space? Is it supply? Any incremental commentary you could give there would be helpful?\n\nVictor J. Coleman\n\nYes. I mean, listen, it's so hard to pinpoint. Every case is a case by case. We've seen tenants come negotiate feverishly and have leases out for signature and we've waited. I mean we've got 2 fairly substantial leases that have been on the depths of the legal counsel fully negotiated for a matter of months, on overseas and one domestic.\r\nSo Michael, I just think that it's just taking time. And maybe if you want to read into it a little deeper, I don't think it's about looking at the footprint or the competitive landscape. I just think it's a need currently versus a need in the future. And maybe that's where the decision tree is right now.\r\nObviously, things have changed expeditiously in terms of back to work and the number of tenants that have come out and companies have come out with policies, the next phase of policy is enforcement. And I think that level of enforcement goes to execution of leases. And I think that's exactly where we are right now. \r\nWe're on that precipice of everybody's policies are in place. Now they're going to be enforced as the example we gave with Amazon, which is a great example. Now the enforcement comes into place. So now they recognize the need and then the executions are the next stage. Art?\n\nArthur X. Suazo\n\nYes. But we've seen forward thinking on this relative to all the 10 bases across our portfolio. Why? Because over the first half of the year, we've seen a spike in tours early activity. And that early activity is going to translate into actual transactions downstream. And so they've already been thinking about this and the return to work, I think, which has caused the spike in early interest.\n\nMichael Anderson Griffin\n\nGreat. And then just going back to the writers' strike. I mean, obviously, I think it's anybody's guess as to when this thing ends, but is there a worry if it gets protracted kind of into the latter part of this year that given you have a seasonal aspect of this business that production could be slower to ramp up into 2024?\n\nVictor J. Coleman\n\nYes, it's a great question. Listen, I think we're very confident that when this ends, the ramp-up will be nonseasonal and it will just go. And as I said, we just had an example of this with COVID 2 years ago, and we saw the results and they were pretty spectacular. I think seasonality is out the window. \r\nI do caution, and I know Harout has made it evident to everybody who he speaks with. We're not saying that next day things jump. I mean this is a business and an industry that you're going to have scripts written, you're going to have sets designed, you're going to have actors hired and then you're going to have production in play, and that does take time. \r\nI think they're getting prepared for it behind the scenes, but there will be some form of a ramp up. I don't know when it's going to be. But when it's up and running, we're going to benefit from it, and we think it's going to be fairly expeditious and furious.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.\n\nJohn P. Kim\n\nWith the repayments of the Quixote note, you now have $528 million outstanding on the line. And I was wondering how you plan to pay that down, whether it's disposition proceeds? I'm not sure if the 5 assets are enough to fully pay that down, free cash flow or long-term debt refinancing?\n\nMark T. Lammas\n\nYes. I mean I think the first two are the sources, along with the dividend cut. So expect to see cash flow and our coverage on dividend continue to improve, especially when studio operations return to normal. That net cash flow net of debt and dividends will go towards either the payment of capital requirements that otherwise would have required the use of the line or reduction of the line. \r\nIt will just depend on the period of time that we're talking about. So that will do -- the asset sales also go to reduce that, the line balance. The use of -- it's possible if the capital markets are more available and the cost of secured debt is attractive, potentially, we would access the secured markets to reduce it. But I think the excess cash flow and asset sales are really where we're going to get the debt reduction.\n\nJohn P. Kim\n\nOkay. Some of the multifamily companies this quarter talked about property tax relief in Seattle. I don't think we've heard you or other office companies talk about this. But I'm wondering if you see a similar trend either in Seattle or just property taxes, general, being alleviated?\n\nVictor J. Coleman\n\nYes. Listen, I think we are all over it in all of our markets. We are seeing a very good resetting of valuations and property tax benefits to the company in all of our assets in California and in Washington at the same time. I think our team is way ahead of the curve on that, and you'll see some impacts in the quarters to come. We have already gotten wins. I think the wins will then impact the bottom line expense reduction on taxes and potentially some rebates as well across the board.\n\nJohn P. Kim\n\nOkay. And Victor, you talked about AI demand and the potential opportunity. I was wondering if you had seen or talking to any tenants currently in your portfolio, either direct or sublease, and if there's any way to quantify how much demand there is out there?\n\nVictor J. Coleman\n\nWell, I can tell you, like in my prepared remarks, as I said, San Francisco seems to be leading the pack on where the AI demand is. It's currently today at about almost 900,000 square feet. We've seen a couple of deals done. Hayden is an AI company that did 42,000 square feet in the city. I also think that another -- Hive, which is another AI company did, I think about 60,000 square feet.\r\nThere's another 800-plus thousand square feet of activity right now. Some of it has been for sublease space and some of it is direct deals. So I think the numbers that we're quantifying at least that are real. It's about 600,000 square feet of net absorption. And then just like it was asked about the residual, then you're going to see the follow-on on ancillary companies that are servicing these AI companies hopefully growing.\r\nAnd we're optimistic that it's going to make some kind of an impact. But it's real, it's now, and we'll see where it goes in the next couple of quarters. But we're looking at a couple of tenants that are very active in the marketplace and trading paper back and forth. So we're hopeful that we can execute on that.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Julien Blouin with Goldman Sachs.\n\nJulien Blouin\n\nHarout, maybe for you, what is causing the increase in the interest expense guidance? Is it just the forward curve going up and the impact on floating rate debt and I guess also the interest rate cap expirations you have coming up this quarter?\n\nHarout Krikor Diramerian\n\nIt's a few things, but you hit upon a couple of them. One is the forward curve increase. Also while this doesn't help interest expense, it does -- accretive to us, which is we pay off the Quixote loan and generated $10 million savings. However, the cost of that loan versus the current curve is increasing interest expense.\n\nJulien Blouin\n\nGot it. Okay. That makes sense. And we were -- I was encouraged to hear that the covenants came in line with your projections. It sounds like you don't really expect any issues there. I guess just could you sort of walk us through what the deterioration in the unsecured indebtedness to unencumbered asset value was? \r\nAnd I guess also when you say you don't expect any issues, does that sort of assume sort of any length of strike? Or is there maybe a minimum level of leasing or tenant retention through the end of '24 that needs to happen?\n\nMark T. Lammas\n\nSo yes, the deterioration is really a combination of the increase in the unsecured debt balance stemming from the repayment of the Quixote, which was a secured debt that went on -- that became unsecured upon repayment. And then there's almost 40 assets running through the unencumbered asset calculation and some of them increased in the quarter, some of them decreased. The net decrease was about $112 million. We stressed test the metric, including a protracted strike all the way through the end of '24.\r\nAnd even in the most impacted quarter, we still, on that metric, remain more than 300 basis points above the threshold. So the studios -- neither of the studios, I should mention, run through the unencumbered asset base or 1455, which I think some people may focus on due to the block expiration, doesn't affect those valuations at all.\r\nThere's an indirect effect due to the cash flow, right, because to the extent that we are generating more cash flow from the studios, it would be available to repay the debt, which will eventually take hold. So that metric improves as we see the studios normalize. And yes -- and we've factored in or sensitized that for, like I said, the protracted strike, all the known move-outs, everything we can project all the way through the end of '24.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Camille Bonnel with Bank of America.\n\nJing Xian Tan Bonnel\n\nI wanted to pick up on a comment about how market -- mark-to-market opportunities are around 5% for 2023 expirations? If we think about the negative cash rent spreads on the leases you've signed to date, has this been in line with your expectations given you're still seeing positive rent growth -- net effective rent growth?\n\nMark T. Lammas\n\nYes. And our mark on the remaining '23 expirations remains a positive 5%. A couple of deals really account for that 8% drag on the March market. It's the Rivian 60,000 feet extension through '28 within -- we had hit that Rivian deal at literally peak market rents in Palo Alto. And we're obviously glad, we were able to get that significant extension, but it reflects current market so it was a negative 18% mark.\r\nWe also did a 3-month extension with Luminor. It also dragged that number down a bit. If you account for those 2 deals, you're essentially flat mark-to-market. So yes, our numbers still show that the remaining expirations are: one, that was our expectation for the quarter; two we expect to see something like 5% mark.\n\nArthur X. Suazo\n\nYes, more color. That -- both of those yields happen to be in the same exact same market where we hit peak rents and now we're adding market rent, which is also a very healthy rent happens to be -- happen to be well below the mark.\n\nJing Xian Tan Bonnel\n\nSo just specifically within that market and just given demand still remains below, I guess, where you need to be to support stronger pricing power there? Do you expect that these negative rent growth trends will continue over the next 18 months? Or any thoughts if we're close to a bottom here?\n\nMark T. Lammas\n\nWell, I mean, our numbers, which reflect refreshed MLA assumptions to get done every -- I mean, we're constantly reflecting our MLAs show a positive for the balance of '23, and we're essentially flat on our expirations in '24. And in '25, there's a slight positive. So looking through the lens of our assets and assumptions associated with our assets, it suggests sort of a bottoming out.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Dylan Burzinski with Green Street.\n\nDylan Robert Burzinski\n\nI guess just going back to big tech leasing, and I appreciate your comments so far. But one of your peers mentioned that they don't expect big tech leasing to materialize or recover even through next year. So just curious, is that how you guys are sort of viewing this tenant cohort? And if so, what do you think ultimately brings them back to wanting to lease more space?\n\nVictor J. Coleman\n\nListen, I don't know what other landlords are saying. What we're seeing is we're seeing activity in big tech in certain markets. We're seeing a -- already a decision tree that's made as to how space is going to look, and now they're looking to find out where they're going to accommodate in the space. Obviously, we're seeing a flight to quality just doing like everybody else, our higher-quality assets -- the highest-quality assets have the most activity and there's tech activity around that.\r\nI'm not going to venture into same big tech is not coming back or they are not coming back anytime soon. I just know that what Art's team has seen is that, I believe that our tours are higher than most that we've seen in the past, and we're seeing that activity. I do think that in reference to specific to big tech, I mean just look at Amazon. I think their return to the hub messaging last week was dramatic and absolute.\r\nAnd when there was pushback, they said, you know what, if you aren't going to be within an hour's timeline of where your current office is, you can apply to another job. And if you don't, you're expected to be considered as unemployed going forward.\n\nArthur X. Suazo\n\nRight. And it's not just big tech, right? We're seeing it from these comments from AT&T, Farmers, et cetera. It's starting to -- you're starting to see kind of the trickle down.\n\nDylan Robert Burzinski\n\nAppreciate those comments. And I guess just in those discussions, any noticeable trends with regards to changing space layouts?\n\nVictor J. Coleman\n\nYes. I mean, listen, Dylan, we're getting a handle on this real time, and we're seeing the same thing. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, you're seeing a lot more conference room facilities, a lot more space per head. We've seen that number go up to like 165 or more, maybe even close to 200 feet per person when it was as low as like 120.\r\nAnd so that -- those numbers are consistent throughout, more space for less people. And I think that seems to be the trend, obviously, amenity driven. That's the trend and location and quality, which we've talked about since the beginning of this downturn.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley.\n\nRonald Kamdem\n\nJust going back on the leasing, really helpful color on the '23, 2 large expirations in the Amazon deal. But any sort of updates on the -- remind us on the Nutanix space as well as the towers at Shore Center coming due in 2024. Any sort of color or context there, how are conversations going?\n\nArthur X. Suazo\n\nSure. This is Art. Nutanix is -- remember, it's the contractual giveback, we extended them for 215,000 square feet for an additional 7 years. And so this was part of their contractual giveback. The piece that came back in the quarter, it was about 51,000 square feet. We're in leases for half. Half of that currently. Going forward, the next large piece in '23, which is up in May, we're just currently marketing the space. We don't have a backfill user inside, but we are touring currently.\n\nRonald Kamdem\n\nGot it. And then Poshmark, sorry?\n\nArthur X. Suazo\n\nYes Poshmark were in negotiations. They're -- if you think about it, they're a 3-floor tenant, we're in negotiations for 2 floors at the current time, right? So we'll see as they assume what kind of footprint they're looking for, it might be all 3. But right now, we're focused on 2.\n\nRonald Kamdem\n\nGot it. And then zooming out to the -- you talked about the 2 million square feet in the pipeline, is there a way to thematically break that down a little bit? Like, is there like AI, financial services, tech, is there a way to sort of dive into that number a little bit more?\n\nArthur X. Suazo\n\nYes. I don't -- right now, I mean, I don't dissect it in that fashion. But I will tell you the sense that I'm getting on that 2 million feet. By the way, that 2 million feet is up 100,000 square feet quarter-over-quarter after having leased 400,000 feet. So that's -- that early interest that I had been talking about on repeat is real, and it's starting to work its way into our pipeline, which again bodes well.\r\nI would say that because of the markets that we're in, I would say probably 60% of that is -- 60%, 65% of that is tech. Now I can't break it down to AI versus hardware, software, but it's 65% squarely is tech.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Victor Coleman, Chairman and CEO, for any closing remarks.\n\nVictor J. Coleman\n\nThank you so much for participating in this quarter's call, and we'll speak to you all in the next quarter.\n\nOperator\n\nThe conference has now concluded.

To skip the detailed analysis of the technology services industry, go directly to the 5 Oversold Tech Stocks To Buy.\n\nThe technology sector has been booming so far in 2023, mostly due to the generative artificial intelligence segment. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been on the rise for the past few years, but companies are leaning towards investing in the sector more than ever in the current year. According to a survey by CNBC, when companies were asked which technologies they expected to allocate the most capital to over the next 12 months, 47.37% chose AI as their top choice. Other options included, cloud computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT). Nayur Khan, Partner at McKinsey says:\n\n\u201cWe are at an inflection point with artificial intelligence. Generative AI has captured both mainstream and business imaginations. Organizations that are willing to continuously learn and adapt their processes, ways of working, and technology to industrialize ML will succeed in building the muscle needed to leverage AI at scale and unlock its value.\u201d\n\nWhile another Senior Partner, Delphine Nain Zurkiya adds:\n\n\u201cWe often get asked by executives if generative AI is hype or a fundamental shift\u2014the answer is both. From a scientific point of view, foundational models are not hype\u2014they comprise a new class of AI that is elegant in its simplicity yet incredibly powerful in its ability to be tuned to perform many tasks in a human-like manner. From a business point of view, these technologies have the potential to fundamentally disrupt entire categories.\u201d\n\nThe technology sector has been performing well for the past decade but it seems like 2022 just wasn\u2019t its year. Between January to June 2022, the tech-heavy NASDAQ composite was down 29.5% and finished the year with a decline of 32.5%. It was the second-worst year for the NASDAQ composite since 2002. The first one was during the Great Recession of 2008 when it went down 40.5% for the full year. Nevertheless, we cannot single out the sector in 2022 because it was one of the worst years for the global economy and US equities. The only sectors that ended with positive returns in the year were energy and utilities. On top of that, the investments in the tech sector still managed to reach over $1 trillion in 2022, despite the tough economic conditions.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe biggest names in the tech industry have been enjoying the year so far even though the macroeconomic headwinds from the previous year still haven\u2019t phased out. On May 30, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) became the first chip company to touch the $1 trillion market cap milestone and is almost up 210% YTD at the time of writing on August 2. Other elites such as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) have also experienced significant gains this year and are up nearly 153%, 50%, and 37% YTD, respectively. A lot of the growth of these companies can be attributed to investments during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to research, the companies that doubled down on their tech investment during the pandemic are now growing five times faster than the ones that didn\u2019t.\n\nEven though the NASDAQ Composite and NASDAQ-100 are up around 35% and 42% year-to-date at the time of writing on August 2, there are still some stocks that haven\u2019t been doing well and you can check them out on our 15 Worst Performing NASDAQ Stocks In 2023 article. Some of the most oversold tech stocks include Euronet Worldwide, Inc. (NASDAQ:EEFT), TELUS International (Cda) Inc. (NYSE:TIXT), and Perficient, Inc. (NASDAQ:PRFT).

The RSI of these companies was calculated before the market opening on August 2. The Relative Strength Index is a technical indicator that tracks momentum changes in stock prices. An RSI above 70 implies that a stock is overbought and below 30 implies that it is oversold. These levels can be adjusted if needed. The stocks in this article are listed in descending order of their RSI.\n\nNote that, we only chose the stocks that are listed on NYSE and NASDAQ. We also avoided small-cap stocks due to their high volatility.\n\n10 Oversold Tech Stocks to\u00a0Buy\n\n10. Cognex Corporation (NASDAQ:CGNX)\n\n14-day RSI as of August 2: 34.10\n\nCognex Corporation (NASDAQ:CGNX) is an American industrial automation company focusing on machine vision technology that is used for the automation of manufacturing and distribution functions. The company is headquartered in Massachusetts and operates worldwide. Cognex Corporation (NASDAQ:CGNX) had a 14-day relative strength index of 34.10 before the market opening on August 2, making it our 10th most oversold tech stock.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2023, Cognex Corporation (NASDAQ:CGNX) was held by 23 hedge fund holders with a combined stake value of $313.511 million. Fundsmith LLP was the company's most prominent hedge fund holder, owning over 2 million shares worth $102.062 million.\n\nCognex Corporation (NASDAQ:CGNX)\u2019s first quarter 2023 revenue declined by 28.8% year-over-year due to lower consumer spending and weak demand. However, AI is a major tailwind for the company which can benefit Cognex Corporation (NASDAQ:CGNX) in the long term. The company plans to announce its second quarter 2023 result before the market opens on August 3 and expects revenue between the range of $225 million and $245 million.\n\nEuronet Worldwide, Inc. (NASDAQ:EEFT), TELUS International (Cda) Inc. (NYSE:TIXT), and Perficient, Inc. (NASDAQ:PRFT) are some of the most oversold tech stocks to buy along with Cognex Corporation (NASDAQ:CGNX).\n\nRGA Investment Advisors made the following comment about Cognex Corporation (NASDAQ:CGNX) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:\n\n\u201cThis question as to whether anything has structurally changed is as applicable to e-commerce as it is to 2022\u2019s most talked about economic datapoint: the CPI. Before the pandemic, people would speak about \u201csecular stagnation\u201d and the strong disinflationary forces that kept the economy from experiencing a robust post-Great Financial Crisis recovery. Today, we are far more likely to hear about stagflation than \u201csecular stagnation\u201d, yet the economy is growing faster today than it was in the past. We must therefore ask ourselves, what are the biggest changes from before the pandemic to now that would change our economic outlook from disinflation to inflation. The largest change is what people now call \u201cThe Great Resignation\u201d whereby Boomers who entered the workforce in the 1970s finally retiring en masse.[3] This can have consequences for wages, though we would caution against fearing a wage price spiral as underinvestment in efficiency due to an overabundance of labor during the past decade can finally commence with lower levels of fear for labor unions and politicians alike. In fact, investments in productivity might even be encouraged now with fears of inflation front-and-center. As we have pointed out several times in the past, Cognex Corporation (NASDAQ:CGNX) stands to benefit considerably from this change.\u201d\n\n9. Juniper Networks, Inc. (NYSE:JNPR)\n\n14-day RSI as of August 2: 33.88\n\nJuniper Networks, Inc. (NYSE:JNPR) manufactures and sells computer networking devices such as routers, switches, security products, and cloud-native software applications among other things.

They offer next-gen fiber broadband solutions to telecommunication companies primarily for rural markets. The broadband buildout in rural markets is still in the early innings, and the company\u2019s subscription model offers great visibility going forward.\u201d\n\n7. ExlService Holdings, Inc.

Its products include RFID printers, barcode printers, real-time locating systems, and scanners among others. It was founded in 1969 and is headquartered in Lincolnshire, Illinois.\n\nIn Q1 2023, Zebra Technologies Corporation (NASDAQ:ZBRA) stock was held by 26 hedge funds, in line with the previous quarter. Ariel Investments was the largest stakeholder in the company with 476,385 shares worth $151.490 million.\n\nOn August 2, Baird analyst Richard Eastman maintained an Outperform rating on Zebra Technologies Corporation (NASDAQ:ZBRA) and lowered his price target from $322 to $283.

(GNRC) and bar-code manufacturer Zebra Technologies Corporation (NASDAQ:ZBRA).\n\nMeanwhile, ZBRA\u2019s brand strength, distribution network and commitment to innovation enable it to take share, earn industry-leading profitability and penetrate new markets. A recent pullback in stock price provided an attractive entry point. Shares have come under pressure due to investor concerns around inflation and supply chain disruptions. At current valuation levels, we think investors are underappreciating ZBRA\u2019s alignment with the global effort to improve supply chain efficiency. At the same time, the company is leveraging the wide moat in its core business to expand into faster growing markets including warehouse robotics and machine vision. Meanwhile ZBRA continues to deliver prodigious free cash flow which we believe will continue to be deployed towards both growth and share repurchases.\u201d\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 Oversold Tech Stocks To Buy.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n10 Best Small Cap Automotive Stocks To Buy 11 Most Advanced AI Companies 20 Worst Performing Economies in 2023\n\nDisclosure.

Elsewhere, investors gear up for the release of quarterly results from tech giants Apple and Amazon, while Adidas sees a smaller 2023 loss thanks to strong sales of its leftover stock of Yeezy shoes.\n\n1. Futures edge lower after sell-off\n\nU.S. stock futures pointed into the red Thursday, a day after a U.S. credit rating downgrade by ratings agency Fitch sparked a sell-off on Wall Street.\n\nAt 05:18 ET (09:18 GMT), the Dow futures contract lost 85 points or 0.24%, S&P 500 futures shed 12 points or 0.28%, and Nasdaq futures dipped by 55 points or 0.36%.\n\nThe benchmark S&P 500 posted its biggest drop since April in the prior session, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slumped to its worst day since February.\n\nFitch lowered the U.S.'s long-term foreign currency issuer default rating to AA+ from the top-most level of AAA on Tuesday, citing worries around the country's fiscal position and governance standards. The announcements cooled a series of recent gains for stocks.\n\nAttention will likely now turn back to this week's flurry of corporate earnings, with tech giants Amazon and Apple set to report their latest quarterly results after the closing bell.\n\nOn the economic calendar, investors will have a chance to parse through weekly jobless claims data, which will serve as a prelude to the release of the all-important U.S. jobs report for July on Friday.\n\n2. Qualcomm's sales forecast disappoints\n\nQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) has unveiled sales guidance for its fiscal fourth quarter that missed expectations and announced plans to slash jobs as recent weakness in the smartphone market failed to ease.\n\nThe U.S. chip designer said it now expects revenue in the current three-month period to come in between $8.1 billion to $8.9 billion. Analysts had seen the figure at $8.70B.\n\nStory continues\n\nA slump in end-user demand for handsets, along with many smartphone makers choosing to use existing chip supplies to manufacture their devices, both factored into the outlook, the company noted. The smartphone market has faced headwinds as inflation-conscious customers rein in spending on non-essential items and replacement cycles lengthen. According to research firm Canalys, global smartphone shipments dropped by 13% in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nAdding to these underlying issues, the San Diego-based business said it now does not foresee \"any material revenue\" from Huawei because it does not have a license to sell 5G chips to the Chinese telecom group. Qualcomm also flagged that it would likely be hit with \"significant\" restructuring charges linked to workforce reductions.\n\nShares in the firm fell sharply in premarket U.S. trading.\n\n3. Apple and Amazon ahead\n\nMajor tech sector bellwether Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and e-commerce behemoth Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) are scheduled to announce their quarterly earnings Thursday, in two of the most closely-watched releases in what has been a busy week of corporate results.\n\nFor Apple, analysts mostly expect the California-based iPhone maker to report a third straight quarter of declining revenue. The focus will likely be on any details the company may choose to give about its current quarter, which ends in September.\n\nApple's fiscal fourth quarter, which typically includes new smartphone releases and back-to-school laptop purchases, can be a signpost for the company's performance heading into the critical holiday season. But the period may have even greater influence this year, as it could provide clues into whether the U.S. economy can avoid a broader meltdown after a string of aggressive Federal Reserve interest rate hikes.\n\nAt Amazon, the group's key cloud computing division will be in the spotlight.\n\nBellevue, Washington-based Amazon previously flagged that a deceleration in growth in the prior quarter at the unit, Amazon Web Services, continued into April. The slowdown may be reflective of a broader weakness in cloud spending as inflationary pressures persuade clients and individuals to pull back on some tech expenditures.\n\nMeanwhile, as it was with their Big Tech peers last week, executives at both Apple and Amazon may also field questions from analysts about their plans to integrate artificial intelligence into their operations.\n\n4. Adidas sees smaller 2023 loss after Yeezy destocking\n\nAdidas (ETR:ADSGN) has narrowed its projected 2023 loss thanks to strong demand for the leftover stock of its Yeezy shoe brand, the German sports apparel group said on Thursday.\n\nThe company had halted sales of the sneaker after it cut ties with designer Ye last year following antisemitic remarks made by the rapper formerly known as Kanye West.\n\nIn order to avoid a deep write-down on its remaining stock of Yeezy-branded products, Adidas announced in May that it would sell some of this inventory and donate the proceeds to different charities that fight antisemitism and racism.\n\nIn the second quarter, these sales generated around \u20ac400 million (\u20ac1 = $1.0926), leading Adidas to reduce its expected annual loss to \u20ac450M, down from its prior guidance for a loss of \u20ac700M. Adidas also earmarked \u20ac110M for charitable donations.\n\nAnalysts cited by Reuters said that a second batch of Yeezy stock sales will likely attract solid demand as well, albeit not as profitable as the initial release. Adidas noted that its full-year outlook does not include the impact of another Yeezy stock drop.\n\n5. Oil retreats amid signs of tightening supplies, Fitch downgrade\n\nOil prices fell Thursday on worries about the global economic outlook, even after a record drop in U.S. inventories indicated a substantial tightening in crude markets.\n\nOfficial data, released Wednesday, showed that U.S. crude inventories shrank by over 17 million barrels in the week to July 28 - the biggest drop recorded in data stretching back to 1982.\n\nThe Fitch downgrade of the U.S. credit rating also dented risk appetite for a second consecutive day, weighing on oil prices. In the prior session, crude fell from more than three-month highs in the wake of the ratings agency's announcement.\n\nBy 05:11 ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.18% lower at $79.35 a barrel, while the Brent contract dropped 0.24% to $83.00.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nApple and Amazon to report, Adidas narrows loss forecast - what's moving markets\n\nBill Ackman is short 30-year treasuries 'in size'\n\nECB's Panetta backs keeping rates high over more hikes", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-amazon-report-adidas-narrows-052525202.html", "symbols": ["AAPL.US", "AMZ.F", "AMZ.XETRA", "AMZN.MX", "AMZN.US", "AMZO34.SA", "QCOM.US"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": -0.973, "neg": 0.09, "neu": 0.842, "pos": 0.068}}, {"date": "2023-08-03T05:00:00+00:00", "title": "Amazon Earnings Are Here.

Now it's time to hear from two of the other key pillars of the U.S. economy: Apple and Amazon.\n\nThe twin tech giants, which collectively account for more than $4 trillion of market cap as well as billions of dollars of consumer and business spending, are due to report quarterly earnings after Thursday's market close.\n\nThe companies' results\u2014and just as importantly, their forecasts for the coming months\u2014will add vital data that could confirm recent hopes that a recession has been avoided, or reignite worries about the business landscape.\n\n\u201cWhen Cook talks everyone else listens given Apple's unique perch and perspective around consumer demand globally and what this means for the path looking forward,\u201d Wedbush\u2019s Dan Ives wrote in a recent note to investors.\n\nFrom the sales of iPhones and Macs, to the volume of online shopping and the spending by companies on cloud computing services, Apple and Amazon together provide one of the most well-rounded snapshots of market conditions.\n\nAmazon, which employs more than 1.5 million workers, is the world\u2019s second largest online retailer (in addition to owning the Whole Foods supermarket chain, which Bloomberg recently reported is being overhauled in a bid by Amazon to go after Walmart\u2019s brick-and-mortar empire).\n\nIn July, Amazon announced that it had experienced the largest Prime Day sales ever. Prime members purchased over 375 million items and saved more than $2.5 billion in total (Amazon did not say how much money shoppers actually spent), compared to 300 million items and $1.7 billion last year. This revenue won\u2019t show up in the second quarter results, but it\u2019s a positive sign for consumer spending, which accounts for roughly two-thirds of U.S. GDP.\n\nTaylor Swift vs the iPhone\n\nD. A. Davidson analyst Tom Forte wrote in a recent report that the Prime Day numbers could raise hopes of a spending pickup in the home and consumer electronics categories, following a phase in which post-COVID \u201crevenge travel\u201d and in-person, live events have captured a lot of consumers\u2019 discretionary income.\n\nStory continues\n\nCompared to Taylor Swift or Beyonce concerts, Apple may have a hard time competing right now\u2014especially given that the iPhone is awaiting its Fall upgrade to a new model. Analysts expect Apple to post its third consecutive year-over-year revenue decline during the recently ended quarter, and many investors will be more interested in the company\u2019s outlook for the remainder of the year.\n\nD. A. Davidson\u2019s Forte told Fortune the iPhone is more like a consumer staple than a discretionary item \u2014 it\u2019s a necessity, not a rewarding purchase. That\u2019s not a bad thing in a challenging macro-economic environment \u2014 iPhones keep selling while consumers do without other products. And indeed, Apple's stock is up nearly 60% this year, as investors find comfort in its stable business.\n\nBut while expectations for iPhone sales are modest, Forte says a key question is what it would mean if iPhone sales do worse than expected?\n\n\u201cIf Apple reports weaker than expected iPhone sales...then it would suggest that the macroeconomic pressure may be negatively affecting products that we perceive to be a consumer staple, not a discretionary item,\u201d Forte said.\n\nMany investors will also be looking to overseas markets like China and India for signs of strength in Apple\u2019s business and in the global economy.\n\nAmazon's cloud barometer\n\nIf consumer spending disappoints in Apple\u2019s or Amazon\u2019s reports, the performance of Amazon\u2019s cloud business could become particularly important to the broader economic picture. When the Commerce Department reported that U.S. GDP increased 2.4% in Q2, it noted that business spending surged by 7.7%. That's an encouraging sign for cloud computing services that cater to corporate customers.\n\nAmazon\u2019s cloud rivals delivered mixed results in the second quarter, with Microsoft reporting weaker-than-expected cloud revenue growth, while Google\u2019s cloud business posted its first ever profit. Analysts expect Amazon\u2019s AWS cloud business revenue to increase by 9% year-over-year in Q2, according to CRN.\n\nWhile Amazon AWS is in a fierce battle for market share against Microsoft and Google, its position as the dominant cloud provider makes it an important gauge of broader corporate cloud spending.\n\nFor Amazon investors as well as for those reading economic tea leaves, the AWS outlook will provide plenty of fuel for thought.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nMore from Fortune: \r\n5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year\u2014all while working from home\r\nLooking to make extra cash?

By definition, these enterprises represent publicly traded technology firms that enjoy a strong buy consensus view \u2013 or the equivalent.\n\nTo be fair, if you\u2019re looking to load up on tech stocks, going with the heavily endorsed ideas might not give you a bargain rate. Like anything in life, it\u2019s give or take. If you want the predictability of top tech stocks, you\u2019re going to sacrifice upside potential. On the flip side, if you want dramatic, life-changing returns, predictability will often go out the window.\n\nAt the same time, analyst-supported ideas may offer a more sensible approach. With the Federal Reserve dealing with a difficult economic framework of seeking disinflation in a hot labor market, risk-on enterprises may have a short shelf life, especially if interest rates continue to rise.\u00a0On that note, below are the best tech stocks to buy now, according to the experts.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocks\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/CC7\n\nA powerhouse among strong buy tech stocks, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) might appear to have lost some of its thunder. After all, other enterprises have made significant gains in areas such as AI. However, the company deserves respect because its Google ecosystem likely isn\u2019t going anywhere. For example, Google currently owns 92% of the global search engine market.\n\nAccording to information provided by TipRanks, analysts presently peg GOOG as a strong buy \u2013 well, that\u2019s the point of this story, right? This assessment breaks down as six buys, two holds and zero sells. Further, the experts\u2019 average price target lands at $142.63, implying a bit over 8% upside potential.\n\nOn a financial note, GOOG doesn\u2019t offer the greatest discount. For instance, shares trade hands at a forward earnings multiple of 23.2. That\u2019s a bit higher than the sector median of 22.71x. Still, Alphabet enjoys a three-year revenue growth rate (per-share basis) of 22.9%. It\u2019s also consistently profitable, warranting consideration for one of the top tech stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon (AMZN) tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocks\n\nSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.com\n\nEasily one of the most well-known strong buy tech stocks, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) first inked its name into the cultural lexicon through its e-commerce business. It pretty much pioneered the online marketplace industry. From there, it launched into myriad other innovations such as cloud computing. By being an integral component of the ground floor of the consumer economy, Amazon isn\u2019t going anywhere but up on a long-term basis.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Wall Street analysts agree with this overall assumption. Indeed, AMZN isn\u2019t just a run-of-the-mill strong buy tech stocks. Rather, it\u2019s a unanimous strong buy based on 29 analysts. Overall, their average price target lands at $152.52, implying nearly 16% upside potential. Interestingly, the high-side price target stands at $204, implying nearly 55% growth.\n\nNow, no one investment is perfect. If you want to load up on tech stocks on the cheap, AMZN isn\u2019t it. Right now, shares trade for 82X forward earnings. That\u2019s expensive. However, the company still represents a growth machine with a three-year sales expansion rate of 21.9%. Again, it\u2019s a solid idea for the long haul.\n\nMastercard (MA) Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words \"buy\" and \"sell\" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image. Momentum Stocks\n\nSource: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile technically not one of the pure-play ideas among the best tech stocks to buy now, financial services firm Mastercard (NYSE:MA) deserves consideration. Regarding the theme of the hour, the company has invested heavily in its payment technology solutions and customer experiences. On a fundamental note, Mastercard may see a cynical upside as more people turn to plastic to make ends meet.\n\nAnother reason to peg MA as one of the strong buy tech stocks centers on its universal appeal among the expert class. Per TipRanks, Mastercard presently carries a unanimous strong buy view among 19 analysts. Further, their average price target clocks in at $461.44, implying over 16% upside potential. In addition, the high side target comes in at $526, implying over 32% growth.\n\nAs with the other ideas, if you want to load up on tech stocks at a discount, Mastercard isn\u2019t the best idea. Right now, shares trade at a forward multiple of 32.59. In contrast, the credit services sector runs a median multiple of 8.86. However, Mastercard is relevant and enjoys robust and consistent profitability.\n\nIntuitive Surgical (ISRG) A businessman ripping his shirt off to reveal an upward green arrow with the word buy on it underneath\n\nSource: ImageFlow/Shutterstock.com\n\nAn exceptionally enticing idea for strong buy tech stocks, Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) specializes in minimally invasive care. Thanks to its da Vinci surgical system, medical doctors can perform complex operations accurately while yielding minimal recuperation period in hospital for patients, thus reducing costs and burdens across the board. Unsurprisingly, ISRG gained 22% of its equity value since the January opener. It\u2019s also up nearly 36% in the trailing year.\n\nAgain, following in line with the theme, analysts peg ISRG as a strong buy. It\u2019s not a unanimous vote though it\u2019s darn close. Among 14 analysts, only two dissented, choosing to assess shares as a hold. Overall, the experts\u2019 price target lands at $377.14, implying over 16% upside potential. The high-side target comes in at $400, implying over 23% growth.\n\nAs with many other celebrated top tech stocks, ISRG carries a rich premium of 59x forward earnings. It also trades at 17.38X trailing revenue. However, its balance sheet is robust with zero debt. That\u2019s worth keeping in mind.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) a green button on a keyboard has an arrow pointing upward with the word \"Buy\". representing safe stocks to buy\n\nSource: AdityaB. Photography/ShutterStock.com\n\nWhile an incredibly boring enterprise if you\u2019re looking to load up on tech stocks, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) makes up for it with its exceptional relevance. Sure, everybody loves their portable smart devices from that \u201cfruit\u201d company. However, when it comes to running business applications on desktops, Microsoft Windows beats out everybody else. It\u2019s not close.\n\nOf course, Microsoft has been aggressively investing in other areas, particularly AI. Thanks to its partnership with OpenAI and its remarkable chatbot ChatGPT, the deal adds new life to MSFT. Subsequently, analysts responded in kind, making MSFT one of the strong buy tech stocks.\n\nAlthough MSFT does carry one hold and one sell view, 30 other experts believe it\u2019s going places. And that place would be an average price target of $391.63 or over 16% up.\u00a0Along with the other ideas for the best tech stocks to buy now, I can\u2019t say that MSFT is remarkably cheap. Although priced at 30.35X forward earnings, Microsoft is pretty much fairly valued. More importantly, the company delights shareholders with solid top-line growth and excellent profit margins.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) image of businessperson and bar graph with dollar signs to represent undervalued stocks\n\nSource: Wright Studio/Shutterstock.com\n\nWhen it comes to graphics processing units (GPUs), the main rival of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) gets plenty of love. However, investors seeking to load up on tech stocks that want to try something different might want to consider AMD. Fundamentally, the company provides almost-identical relevancies: develop high-powered processors that can undergird the needs of advanced AI protocols.\n\nGiven the importance of semiconductors for AI-based solutions, it\u2019s no surprise that AMD ranks among the strong buy tech stocks. In this case, among 31 analysts, 24 rated shares a buy. Of those who are not quite ready to commit to a buy rating, they issued a hold. Still, if time represents any importance, the most recent six ratings are all optimistic. Right now, the average price target lands at $136.36, implying 16% upside potential.\n\nSimilar to Advanced Micro\u2019s rival, AMD is pricey, trading hands at over 41x forward earnings. As well, it runs a revenue multiple of 8.28. Still, the company prints a very robust three-year revenue growth rate of 35.7%, outflanking 89% of the competition.\n\nGlobalFoundries (GFS) picture of a man circling buy on a stock chart. Hyper-Growth Stocks to Buy\n\nSource: ImageFlow/ShutterStock.com\n\nA multinational semiconductor contract manufacturing and design company, GlobalFoundries (NASDAQ:GFS) ranks among the most important names for best tech stocks to buy now. While the Covid-19 crisis symbolized a sharp lesson for society, it particularly highlighted economic vulnerabilities. Too much of our tech supply chain depends on Asia. To mitigate this dynamic, GlobalFoundries may help boost domestic semiconductor manufacturing.\n\nTo no one\u2019s shock, GFS qualifies as one of the strong buy tech stocks. In fact, at the time of writing, GFS was only one analyst shy of a unanimous buy view. However, an assessment of 13 buys and one hold is a good day at the office. On average, the experts\u2019 price target stands at $76.48, implying nearly 23% upside potential. Also, the high-side target is $100, implying almost 61% growth.\n\nIn its totality, GFS appears fairly valued, trading at a trailing earnings ratio of 22.55X and a forward earnings ratio of 28X. Interestingly, the market prices GFS at an enterprise-value-to-EBITDA ratio of 9.63X, favorably lower than 66.22% of the competition. Therefore, it might be one of the best tech stocks to buy now.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Japanese stocks were among the worst performers for the day, with the Nikkei 225 index sliding 1.6%, while the broader TOPIX fell 1.2%. Local stocks were hit by a mix of profit taking, as well as uncertainty over the Bank of Japan\u2019s stance on its ultra-dovish monetary policy.\n\nAustralia\u2019s ASX 200 fell 0.5% as data showed that the country\u2019s trade surplus remained steady in June. Australian retail sales also fell less than expected in the second quarter.\n\nFutures for India\u2019s Nifty 50 index pointed to a slightly positive open, after the index plummeted from record highs this week.

The country's biggest economic engines - manufacturing and real estate - are also struggling despite promises of more support.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAsian stocks fall as risk-off persists after U.S. rating cut\n\nBMW sees solid revenue growth in first half\n\nSingapore bank DBS' Q2 profit beats estimates; expects record year", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/asian-stocks-fall-risk-off-234903648.html", "symbols": ["AAPL.US", "AMZN.US", "HSI.INDX"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.992, "neg": 0.046, "neu": 0.826, "pos": 0.127}}, {"date": "2023-08-02T21:20:46+00:00", "title": "Amazon expands Fresh grocery offerings to non-Prime members", "content": "Amazon is expanding its grocery business. Customers who aren't subscribed to Amazon's Prime membership will be allowed to participate in services from their grocery offering, Fresh, as part of their bid to grab more share of the U.S. grocery market. Amazon currently only represents 4.4% of the total U.S. grocery market according to UBS. Yahoo Finance Live discusses Amazon's move.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nSEANA SMITH: Let's take a look at some of the biggest stories, other stories that we're keeping an eye on of the day. We had Josh Schafer, Brooke DiPalma here to break it all down. And guys, let's start off with the story that caught my eye. And that's the latest out of Amazon. The really doubling down on their grocery business. And here's what they're doing, they're revamping it to some extent.\n\nSo the fresh option, Amazon Fresh is now going to be offered to non-Prime members, something that has not been the case in the past. They're also going to be redesigning some of their stores, revamping their stores, testing automated warehouse features here. This is all in an effort to grab a bigger piece of the grocery market. And there has been a number of estimates out there. UBS, one of the latest on the Street to come out, saying that they estimate the US grocery business is about $1.5 trillion. And Amazon is in about fifth place when it comes to that. So they need to do something. We'll see whether or not this really moves the needle here for them.\n\nBROOKE DIPALMA: Yeah. And also, it's interesting to see that. I mean, Walmart, Kroger, Albertsons, all ahead of the game when it comes to-- as you can see right here, when it comes to the grocery space. And Amazon really when they acquired Whole Foods, they really thought they were going to be a main player within this space. And they continue to struggle to grab market share. And really, that just walk out technology, I know we were talking about right before really not as optimistic or not as encouraging as maybe they thought.\n\nStory continues\n\nJOSH SCHAFER: I thought of an innovative idea when we were just showing the market share there guys. 3.5% for Publix. Maybe Amazon just needs a Pub/Sub. But actually, like, I think sometimes like we overthink groceries to some extent when it comes to online orders and things like that. I'm thinking about myself as a consumer and how I grocery shop. I grocery shop a lot. I go multiple times throughout the week, because I just like going and I like going and grabbing my things and picking stuff. And I wonder if part of this push for Amazon is to just become a little bit more of a normal grocery store by allowing people that aren't members to use Amazon Fresh, to become a little bit more broader and consumer fit.\n\nWe know there are a lot of Amazon Prime members, of course. But to broaden that out and just be a grocery store that people can go to in the same way people feel like they can order on Amazon. Yes, people order if they're Prime members. But you can still use Amazon online when you're not a Prime member. So that part of it sticks out to me to be able to expand beyond the Prime membership.\n\nBROOKE DIPALMA: Yeah. What I think is interesting too is that you still are going to have to pay a delivery fee if you're not a Prime member. And so in this environment where consumers are really looking to stretch their dollar, they're looking for value, will they necessarily go to Amazon Fresh as their first choice? I don't know. And I really think that's what they continue to struggle with. People don't think necessarily of Amazon Fresh as their go-to.\n\nSEANA SMITH: Yeah. And I also think that they're just up against stiff competition when it comes to the delivery side of groceries, right? I'm someone who orders my groceries all of the time. Josh and I have a little bit different stages of life. If you have young kids at home, you don't necessarily have the time to be taking multiple trips to the grocery store.\n\nJOSH SCHAFER: I'm trying to kill time. I'm really trying to find things to do.\n\nSEANA SMITH: But I think that this is a smart play just in terms of the fact so many people opt for Instacart. There's many other options that you can go to. So the fact that they are placing an emphasis on this, they're opening up to non-Prime members, I do think they have a real opportunity here to increase their base. Whether or not those customers then are repeated-- repetitive customers, that's a whole other question.\n\nJOSH SCHAFER: And it was interesting, I saw one analyst call it the last frontier for Amazon, right, the last frontier the consumer, one of the only areas of the consumer they're non terminating. So I'm just curious what we're going to hear in that earnings call tomorrow. Remember, Amazon earnings tomorrow after the bell. Seana's going to have you covered with it.\n\nSEANA SMITH: Of course, we will.\n\nJOSH SCHAFER: What is Andy Jassy going to say about groceries on that call? Announcements like this don't normally happen the day before earnings unless they're going to probably try and talk about it a little bit on the call and play it up. So it'll be an interesting part of the story. I think we'll probably be watching the Cloud story more.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/video/amazon-expands-fresh-grocery-offerings-212046697.html", "symbols": ["AMZ.F", "AMZ.XETRA", "AMZN.MX", "AMZN.US", "AMZO34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.997, "neg": 0.016, "neu": 0.87, "pos": 0.114}}, {"date": "2023-08-02T20:46:41+00:00", "title": "CVS: Strategies and Opportunities", "content": "In a recent earnings call, CVS Health Corp. (NYSE:CVS) President and CEO Karen Lynch and Chief Financial Officer Shawn Guertin discussed various strategies and opportunities that could potentially mitigate headwinds and drive growth in the coming years. Several analysts posed questions to the company's executives regarding various aspects of the business. The management team, led by Lynch, provided insightful answers, shedding light on the company's strategies and future prospects.\n\nStrategies and opportunities from the CEO and CFO\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with CVS. Click here to check it out.  CVS 30-Year Financial Data The intrinsic value of CVS\n\nGuertin emphasized the company's commitment to achieving adjusted earnings per share targets of $9 for 2023 and approximately $10 for 2024. He acknowledged the existence of certain headwinds, particularly related to Stars and Centene, but expressed confidence in the organization's ability to overcome them. He highlighted two key levers that could help mitigate these challenges.\n\nThe first lever involves exploring alternatives to accelerate growth and synergy realization in Signify and Oak Street. For Signify, CVS plans to leverage its combined assets to expand product offerings and capabilities for all payers, driving continued strong multi-payer growth. With the early closing of the Oak Street acquisition, CVS aims to explore alternative growth vehicles that would allow it to accelerate clinic growth and minimize dilution. Guertin emphasized the importance of starting this work well in advance of 2024 to maximize its impact.\n\nFurthermore, the closing of these strategic transactions and the resegmenting of CVS Health's operations provide an opportunity to improve focus, reduce administrative and operational costs and achieve greater organizational efficiency. By streamlining processes, eliminating duplicative efforts and enhancing operational efficiency, CVS expects to realize significant cost savings. These cost reductions are expected to serve as mitigating tailwinds for 2024 and 2025, further supporting the company's earnings goals.\n\nStory continues CVS: Strategies and Opportunities\n\nDuring the call, Guertin also addressed the concept of embedded Ebitda, which refers to the long-term value generated by accelerating clinic growth. While the GAAP financials may not fully capture this embedded Ebitda, he emphasized its significance and the potential for models and vehicles that could both accelerate clinic growth and better manage the dilutive impact. With the early closing of the Oak Street acquisition, CVS Health now has the opportunity to explore and potentially execute on these models, aiming to have a positive impact on 2024 earnings.\n\nAddressing analysts' questions\n\nOne of the questions came from Michael Cherny of Bank of America, who sought clarification on the segmentation change within CVS. Cherny inquired about the movement of specialty and mail revenue and Ebit from Health Services to Pharmacy and Consumer Wellness. Lynch confirmed the change and emphasized the importance of understanding the full context of the guidance shift. Additionally, she addressed the impact of the 340B program on Health Services and Pharmacy and Consumer Wellness, highlighting the need for bridging the total numbers.\n\nLisa Gill from JPMorgan commended the company on its performance in the pharmacy benefit management industry, but raised concerns about potential changes in the sector. Lynch acknowledged the critical role played by PBMs in lowering drug costs and emphasized the efficiency and effectiveness of CVS's PBM operations. She highlighted the company's commitment to transparency and innovation, as well as its clients' ability to choose how they contract for rebates and spread pricing. Lynch also mentioned the high level of member and client satisfaction, as well as the government's recognition of the PBMs' contribution to the health care ecosystem.\n\nEric Percher of Nephron Research questioned Lynch about potential future acquisitions in the health care services sector. She acknowledged the possibility of considering additional assets in the long term, but emphasized the need to focus on executing the recently acquired assets. She mentioned the potential for opportunities in home or health services technology, but stressed the importance of bringing the current products and services to bear for customers.\n\nKevin Caliendo from UBS sought clarification on the second-quarter medical benefit ratio and utilization expectations. Geurtin confirmed that the second-quarter MBR would be flat compared to the first quarter. He mentioned that utilization expectations were in line with projections, with higher flu rates being a notable factor. However, he did not provide specific segment breakdowns for utilization expectations.\n\nAlbert Rice, an analyst from Credit Suisse, directed his questions toward the company's Medicare Advantage plans and the mitigation steps taken to offset Star Rating headwinds. Lynch expressed confidence in Oak Street Health's ability to adapt to pending changes in risk adjustment, highlighting their positioning relative to other options. Regarding the cost reduction programs, Guertin provided an update on the plan that was impacted, but specific details were not disclosed.\n\nConclusion\n\nOverall, CVS Health's CEO and CFO expressed confidence in the company's ability to achieve its earnings targets and navigate potential headwinds. Through strategic initiatives, such as exploring growth opportunities in Signify and Oak Street, streamlining operations and managing clinic growth, the company aims to drive earnings growth and deliver value to its shareholders. Investors should be closely watching the company's progress as it executes on these strategies and works toward its financial goals.\n\nThe retail pharmacy company remains committed to executing its goals, delivering value to customers and navigating potential changes in the health care industry from companies like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). The focus on clinic growth seems well suited to CVS by focusing on the advantages of its existing brick-and-mortar locations. I expect the stock price to continue pace in line with very long-term trends.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cvs-strategies-opportunities-204641409.html", "symbols": ["AMZN.US", "CVS.F", "CVS.MX", "CVS.US", "CVSH34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 1, "neg": 0.018, "neu": 0.763, "pos": 0.219}}, {"date": "2023-08-02T20:41:00+00:00", "title": "Is This the Top the Bears Have Been Hunting For?", "content": "Or are we just seeing another brief selloff that will quickly attract dip buyers and underinvested bulls who have been hungry for less extended entry points?\n\nContinue reading", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/m/21202ec9-f5cd-387c-b5e6-c94ecd53fac7/is-this-the-top-the-bears.html", "symbols": ["AMZ.F", "AMZ.XETRA", "AMZN.MX", "AMZN.US", "AMZO34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.361, "neg": 0, "neu": 0.915, "pos": 0.085}}, {"date": "2023-08-02T20:15:03+00:00", "title": "3 Under-The-Radar Metaverse Stocks to Make Your Move on Now", "content": "The Metaverse stands out as a progressive\u00a0frontier, and the boundless and immersive virtual universe continues to gain momentum.

If you want to skip our analysis of businesswomen and female entrepreneurship, you can go directly to 5 Self-Made Female Billionaires Under 50.\n\nPresence of Women in the Business\n\nThe presence of women in the business has become more important than ever before. Today, we live in a globalized world and the internet has created opportunities for everyone to set up and start their business. Even young entrepreneurs are making millions of dollars each month, all thanks to technology and social media platforms such as Youtube owned by Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Instagram and Facebook owned by Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META).\n\nWomen can be as important for a business as men. They bring unique ideas, skills, experiences, and perspectives to the workplace. For companies, it could lead them to succeed in a globally competitive environment. A major feature added by women in business is diversity, including gender, ethnic, age, and cultural diversity. This improves the decision-making and problem-solving capability of a firm. Women bring alternate viewpoints, which can help businesses to target their female audience in various consumer markets. Moreover, women contribute enormously to the global economy, which is substantial considering the global economic crises.\n\nFemale billionaires are massively contributing to the global economy and self-made female billionaires are ideal for young girls to look up to in their professional life. The Forbes World\u2019s Richest List 2023 states that female billionaires are up in numbers this year, from 327 in 2022 to 337 in 2023.\n\nPositives for Women Entrepreneurs\n\nWomen are making their way to the top in the corporate world along with men. Over the decades, men had dominated top positions of executives in almost all sectors. The evolution of startups and modern technology has paved way for female entrepreneurs to show their skills as executives and businesspeople. As we mentioned earlier, 10% of the women executives are now leading Fortune 500 companies.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn 18 November 2022, the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) 2021/2022 Women\u2019s Entrepreneurship Report highlighted women entrepreneurs' statistics. The report suggested that women represent one in three high-growth entrepreneurs in the world. This is quite a development for female entrepreneurs over the past few years. \u201cWomen represent two out of every five early-stage entrepreneurs,\u201d said Amanda Elam, the lead author of the 2021/2022 Women\u2019s Entrepreneurship Report. Further, Elam added that women are playing an active role in the entrepreneurial economy.\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, women are mainly involved in three industries including healthcare, salons and pet care businesses, and scientific and technical services. To add to this, the Women\u2019s Entrepreneurship Report suggests that almost half of women entrepreneurs held stakes in the wholesale and retail sector, with one in five women entrepreneurs involved in the Government and Social Services sector. Whereas, women in the Information, Computers, and Technology (ICT) sector accounted for 2.7% compared to 4.7% of men, who are starting businesses in this sector. ICT has one of the largest shares in the venture market, as it draws the majority of venture capital dollars around the world.\n\nE-commerce has been a big market for women entrepreneurs to start their businesses. On February 8, Forbes Advisor shared 38 e-commerce statistics for 2023 which mention that 20.8% of retail purchases are expected to take place online in 2023 and reach 24% by 2026. As half of the women entrepreneurs are in the wholesale and retail business, they have a huge opportunity to take advantage of this online marketplace. Furthermore, Forbes Advisor highlighted that the global e-commerce market is projected to reach $6.3 trillion in 2023 and grow to over $8.1 trillion by 2026. Whereas, the largest e-commerce market shareholder is Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), with its online platform accounting for 37.8% of e-commerce sales. As we mentioned earlier, on June 19, SellerApp pointed out that 33% of the retailer sellers on Amazon.com are women entrepreneurs. This creates a great opportunity for women entrepreneurs to continue evolving in the fast-growing e-commerce market.\n\nThe expansion in the e-commerce marketplace is expected to create opportunities for new players online. Following Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), the rest of the big players in the market include Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY), and AliExpress.com owned by Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA). Forbes Advisor mentioned that the following e-commerce platforms are the most viewed after Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). As of December 2022, Walmart.com ranked on top with 854.9 million monthly visits in sales followed by eBay.com with 669.5 million visits. The Chinese e-commerce giant, AliExpress.com made it to third place with nearly 651.9 million visits in sales.\n\nThe positive consumer behavior in the e-commerce market creates huge potential for online businesses worldwide. Nearly 57% of online shoppers shop from international e-commerce platforms. The increasing consumer demand is leading to better-than-expected results for e-commerce companies. Apart from e-commerce, women have made a fortune in other industries, which indicates that female entrepreneurs can dream big and achieve what many think is impossible. One of the self-made female billionaires on our list, Cristina Junqueira, has achieved what everyone might think is an industry where men dominate. In May 2013, Junqueira along with Edward Wible, and David V\u00e9lez co-founded Nubank. In December 2021, the digital bank went public on the New York Stock Exchange as N\u200b\u200bu Holdings Ltd. (NYSE:NU). Junqueira along with her team has built an empire of $36.49 billion in almost ten years, becoming the fourth largest financial institution in Brazil. Since August 2022 Junqueira has been serving the company as Chief Growth Officer and N\u200b\u200bu Holdings Ltd. (NYSE:NU)\u00a0has made stellar progress under her leadership. On July 25, N\u200b\u200bu Holdings Ltd. (NYSE:NU) announced it has crossed 80 million customers in Brazil. Across Latin America which includes Mexico and Colombia, N\u200b\u200bu Holdings Ltd. (NYSE:NU)\u00a0has surpassed 85 million customers. In June 2021, the digital bank had 41 million customers, which has more than doubled in just two years. On May 15, N\u200b\u200bu Holdings Ltd. (NYSE:NU) posted first quarter 2023 results with earnings per share of $0.03, surpassing consensus estimates by $0.02. The company recorded revenue of $1.62 billion, a year-over-year rise of 84.51%. Here are some of the comments from the Q1 2023 earnings call:\n\n\"Over the past two years, Nu was able to double the number of customers from 37 million in early 2021 to more than 79 million at the end of the first quarter of 2023 and already surpassed 80 million customers by April. The strong growth of our customer base associated with the rise in cross-sell and up-sell implied by the high engagement for platform resulted in our quarterly revenues multiplying by almost 7 times in only two years, a triple digit revenue CAGR over this period. The next chart of this slide illustrates our resilient underwriting capabilities. Quarterly gross profit, defined by total revenues, deducted by funding costs, transactional expenses and credit loss allowances, increased by more than 5 times in the period with gross profit margins expanding accordingly even though credit delinquency has increasing the market in which we operate over the past 12 months.\n\nThis compounded effect should continue to be observed over the coming periods providing a valuable combination of growth with increasing profitability in our platform. In Brazil, where we have been operating for nine years, our clients already account for a remarkable 46% of the total adult population of the country.\n\nIt\u2019s staggering and at the same time gratifying to think that almost one in two Brazilians that own a smartphone is a Nu Bank customer. In Mexico and Colombia, where we have been for three years or less, our share of the total population is significantly lower, representing a tremendous opportunity for growth as we expand our product offering and create lasting relationships with our clients. But so far, the experience we\u2019re having in Mexico and in Colombia is more positive than what we saw in Brazil in the first few years. With three years of operations in Brazil, we had 1.2 million customers, representing a penetration of less than 1% of the adult population of the country at that time. Lower than what we now have in Mexico and Colombia.\n\nWhile our customer penetration in Brazil is significant, when we delve into the market share we actually own in each profit pool, it is clear that we still have substantial room to expand our presence.\" 11 Self-Made Female Billionaires Under 50\n\nStasique/Shutterstock.com\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo take data for the self-made female billionaires under 50, we looked into the Forbes list of the World\u2019s Real-Time Billionaires.

For Amazon, AWS has long underpinned essential parts of the company's revenue.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT), both cloud rivals for Amazon, reported earnings last week, with relatively mixed cloud results.\n\nFor its part, Microsoft Azure clocked a decline in its revenue growth, which has been the case each quarter since at least Q3 of last year. Despite the company's overall 8% revenue increase, Microsoft's stock dropped after hours.\n\nMeanwhile, Google Cloud turned profitable for the first time in Q1 and saw an income of $395 million this quarter \u2014 a stark contrast to the same quarter last year, when Google Cloud reported a $590 million loss. Alphabet stock jumped as much as 6% in after-hours trading on July 25.\n\n\"[Microsoft and Google] reported solid but somewhat mixed results as far as a read to AWS,\" UBS analyst Lloyd Walmsley wrote in a July 26 note. \"The continued optimization theme, albeit at a more moderate pace, leaves us comfortable with below-consensus AWS growth in 2Q and 3Q at 8% [year over year].\"\n\nAmazon has been on a substantial cost-cutting push that's notable even among tech giants \u2014 one that has visibly materialized in the company's 27,000 layoffs to date.\n\nAI is also expected to make an appearance in Amazon's earnings call. Though Amazon isn't viewed as leading the charge in the AI frenzy \u2014 as Microsoft, Google, or even Meta (META) are \u2014 Amazon does have its own AI offering, Bedrock, and AWS CEO Adam Selipsky has been vocal about AI and the belief that the tech's future isn't \"winner-take-all.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon stock is up more than 50% year to date.\n\nThe earnings rundown\n\nHere are the most important numbers analysts are expecting to see in Amazon's earnings, as compiled by Bloomberg:\n\nNet sales: $131.63 billion estimated\n\nEPS: 35 cents estimated\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) net sales: $21.71 billion estimated\n\nOperating margin: 3.46% estimated\n\nOperating income: $4.72 billion estimated\n\nQ3 net sales outlook: $138.3 billion estimated\n\nIn Q1, Amazon guided to Q2 net sales of $127 billion to $133 billion.

On the first day of the event, Amazon marked its largest-ever single day of sales, as consumers spent more than $2.5 billion on north of 375 million products, according to the company.\n\nAmazon's vast e-commerce business is often used to look for read-throughs on consumer confidence, which is at its highest level in two years, according to recent Conference Board data.\n\nAmazon's online ads business has been growing fast despite a longstanding digital ad slowdown, though it's still a small part of Amazon's overall business.\n\nWhat analysts are saying pre-earnings:\n\nAmazon's fundamentals might not be the primary topic of conversation during the company's earnings call, according to RBC Capital Markets' Brad Erickson.\n\nInstead, AI will feature heavily, especially given Amazon's (still-mostly-theoretical) competitive advantage with large enterprise customers.\n\n\"We expect commentary to be positive, where not unlike Meta, we'd expect management to speak to an open-sourced mindset with its platform having the greatest ability to allow superior performance, efficiency, and product capabilities to serve the largest customers' AI needs,\" Erickson wrote.\n\nCues from management will be crucial, both when it comes to AI and cloud services.\n\n\"The key question will be whether management suggests that ...

That\u2019s because the competition in all three of those sectors is quite intense, while traditional TV networks are also coming under pressure from cord cutting.\n\nThis list includes companies that certainly fit in these categories. However, I\u2019d also recommend staying away from companies oriented toward video games and the metaverse, as various macro headwinds and a reversion back toward the mean (from very hyped-up levels) could send the valuations of such stocks much lower.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWith all of that said, here are seven communication services stocks to sell.\n\nMeta (META) Meta Written On The Googles - Man Wearing Virtual Reality Goggles Inside A Metaverse. FTC investigating META.\n\nSource: Aleem Zahid Khan / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe owner of Facebook has enjoyed a meteoric rise this year, with Meta (NASDAQ:META) stock soaring 165%. A combination of the company\u2019s spending cutbacks, opportunities in artificial intelligence, and increased optimism about the U.S. economy were responsible for its surge.\n\nBut the social media company\u2019s shares now have a forward price-earnings ratio of 26-times. I believe that this valuation largely prices in the company\u2019s positive catalysts, especially when one considers the company faces tough competition from the likes of Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU), Snap (NYSE:SNAP), TikTok, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL) and even Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) for online ads.\n\nAdditionally, as I\u2019ve noted in the past, the metaverse has been in existence for a few decades. Thus far, this sector hasn\u2019t meaningfully impacted the lives of consumers or investors. Thus, I\u2019m not very optimistic about the ability of the metaverse to become a positive needle mover for META stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nSnap (SNAP) An apple iPhone showing the snapchat application alongside other snapchat logos. SNAP stock.\n\nSource: Ink Drop / Shutterstock.com\n\nFor many years, I had been upbeat about Snap\u2019s long-term outlook due to its ability to attract a high percentage of young users. But now, with the company posting dismal quarterly results even as the overall economy and advertising sector are rather strong, I think that I was probably overly optimistic about SNAP stock.\n\nIn the second quarter, Snap\u2019s top line sank 3.6% versus the same period a year earlier, while its EBITDA, excluding certain items, fell $45.7 million to -$38.5 million. And for the current quarter, it predicted that its adjusted EBITDA would be -$50 million to -$100 million. On the top line for Q3, Snap provided guidance of a 0% to -5% year-over-year change.\n\nAlso noteworthy is that the company\u2019s AI tool has not seemed to please Snapchat\u2019s users, at least in the early days of its launch.\u00a0According to\u00a0TechCrunch, there was \u201ca spike in negative reviews\u201d of the app in the weeks following its launch.\n\nFinally, like Meta, Snap faces a great deal of competition in the internet ad space, and its trailing price-sales ratio of 3.8-times is not particularly attractive.\n\nComcast (CMCSA) Keeping NBC News on the Air Could Hamper Comcast Stock\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nWithout a doubt, conventional TV is a contracting business, and that\u2019s not good news for\u00a0Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA), the owner of NBC Universal.\n\nFor evidence of how quickly conventional TV is shrinking, one needs to look no further than the performance of Disney\u2019s (NYSE:DIS) Media and Entertainment Distribution unit, which is dominated by its conventional TV networks.\n\nThe unit\u2019s revenue rose an anemic 3% versus the same quarter a year earlier, while its operating income sank 42% year-over-year. Additionally, Disney\u2019s apparent desire to sell all or part of its conventional TV networks is indicative of how little growth and value conventional TV has at this point.\n\nMeanwhile, competition is mounting for Comcast\u2019s internet service provider business, as Verizon (NYSE:VZ) has entered the sector with very low selling prices and Starlink is becoming more popular.\n\nGiven all of these factors, CMCSA stock definitely belongs on this list of communication services stocks to sell.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery (WBD) A close-up of the blue and yellow Warner Bros (WBD) sign.\n\nSource: Ingus Kruklitis / Shutterstock.com\n\nLike Comcast,\u00a0Warner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD) owns conventional TV networks in the form of many cable channels that are being undermined by the cord-cutting phenomenon. In the first quarter, the company\u2019s revenue plunged 10% versus the same period a year earlier. This hasn\u2019t been helped by the company\u2019s also-ran streaming service that\u2019s only poised to enter the black this year. Additionally, over the medium-term, the financial performance of the company\u2019s assets are likely to be significantly hurt by the Hollywood strikes.\n\nWhat\u2019s more \u2013 at a time when movie box office receipts remain well below 2019 levels, Warner Bros.\u2019 movie studio will be far from an outperforming asset overall. Yes, its Barbie movie will generate a significant amount of profits for the company in the short-term. However, that one hit is not going to prevent the movie studio from losing money over the long-term.\n\nTo top it all off, Warner Bros. Discovery\u2019s balance sheet needs some work. The company currently has $46.4 billion of net debt. That\u2019s a great deal of debt with which the company (and investors) have to contend with.\n\nRoblox (RBLX) Roblox sign logo at headquarters. RBLX stock\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nAt a time when the economy is thriving and a high percentage of Americans are enjoying vacations and reveling in visiting nightclubs, theme parks, and restaurants, the video game sector (in my view) is not the best space in which to invest. That\u2019s because, of course, consumers are spending so much of their days on real-world activities, leaving little time for video games.\n\nGiven these points, I recommend selling Roblox (NASDAQ:RBLX) stock now.\n\nValuation is certainly another factor in this recommendation, as RBLX stock has a huge trailing price-sales ratio of 10-times. Wall Street appears to be betting that the company\u2019s metaverse-oriented games will explode in popularity, but I\u2019m not so sure.\n\nIndeed, as I noted in the Meta section of this column, the metaverse has been around for decades and has never amounted to much, either in terms of popularity or revenue. The same arguments I levied against Meta apply here.\n\nNotably, Roblox is still a long way from entering the black. Analysts, on average, expect its loss per share to come in at $1.76 this year and $1.65 in 2024. Those aren\u2019t numbers long-term investors want to see, and this stock remains a sell in my books.\n\nElectronic Arts (EA)\n\nSource: 360b / Shutterstock.com\n\nElectronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) is in a similar boat as Roblox. Specifically, with Americans spending a great deal of their time splurging on fun outdoors activities, I don\u2019t think they\u2019re devoting a great deal of their days or budgets to video games. And of course, that does not bode well for Electronic Arts or for EA stock.\n\nSupporting my theory, analysts on average, expect the company\u2019s\u00a0top line to climb only 3.6% this year, while the average estimate calls for earnings per share of $7.71, versus this year\u2019s average estimate of $6.87. In other words, the company\u2019s top and bottom lines are not exactly growing at a frenetic pace.\n\nFurther, EA\u2019s valuation is nothing to write home about, as its forward\u00a0price-earnings ratio is 20-times, which is slightly above average. For those looking for growth, there are better places to find it right now.\n\nFrontier Communications Parent (FYBR) The logo for Frontier Communications (FYBR) is seen in the side of a van.\n\nSource: panch0 aguirre / Shutterstock.com\n\nFrontier Communications Parent (NASDAQ:FYBR) provides cable TV and internet connectivity. Like a few of the other companies on this list, Frontier is clearly being hurt by both the cord-cutting phenomenon and increased competition in the internet services provider space.\n\nIn the latter sector, competition from Verizon\u2019s low-priced offering launched in 2022 hurts this company\u2019s long-term outlook. Additionally, the popularity of Elon Musk\u2019s Spacelink continues to grow. Moreover, as new technologies proliferate and become more affordable, expect many other firms to also start competing with Frontier, dragging down FYBR stock in the process.\n\nSupporting my thesis, analysts expect FYBR to generate a loss of 4 cents per share next year, down from a profit of 3 cents per share in 2023.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

According to anarticle by World of Labor, the average hourly earnings increase by 9% for every extra year of education. These numbers vary between regions; it is the highest at 12.5% in Sub-Saharan Africa. Getting a formal college education corresponds to a better salary. This difference is referred to as the \"college wage premium.\" Education is primarily a public sector service. Governments worldwide pour significant money into education to improve their living standards and nurture economic growth.\n\nWhen the pandemic hit, the education sector had to adapt quickly to the changing circumstances. Students could no longer attend schools in person, and classrooms shifted online. There was an upsurge in the number of students enrolling in online courses. Many education-centricprivate companies emerged, facilitating students worldwide. These private companies offer various services, like free and paid courses, lecture notes, productivity software, and collaborative workspaces. According to a report by Technavio, despite seeing a major transformation, the higher education market is estimated to grow by $63.36 billion, from 2022 to 2027, at a compound annual growth rate of 14.49%.\n\nAI and EdTech\n\nThe development of AI is posing a challenge for some companies and an opportunity for others. On May 2, Reuters reported that ChatGPT is impacting the customer growth rates for Chegg, Inc. (NYSE:CHGG). On the other hand, Coursera, Inc. (NYSE:COUR) is using it as an opportunity to assist its growth. Coursera, Inc. (NYSE:COUR) has used AI to develop \"personalized, interactive learning tutors\" that help students learn more effectively. It has also used AI as a \"content-generation course-building\" tool and for language translation. Employing AI as a language translator helps reach a wider audience.\n\nStory continues\n\nMany companies like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) have started to incorporate AI and data analytics into their productivity software. Education Insights, a feature in Microsoft Teams, uses data analytics to inform educators of students' engagement, learning progress, and well-being. Another tool by Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is Reading Progress which enables students to record themselves while reading aloud. The program notes all the challenging words and provides visual aids and additional reading exercises to help them improve. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) introduced theAWS Cloud, which uses AI and data analytics to facilitate education and research, enabling informed decision-making.\n\nEffective communication has become one of the biggest challenges for online education. A significant product by Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) that facilitates education is Google Workspace for Education. This software enables students and educators to collaborate and communicate easily, regardless of distance.\n\nNoteworthy Names in the Education Industry\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the giants in the education industry. Products like Microsoft Office have enabled thousands of students to be more productive globally. During the pandemic, Microsoft Teams became one of the primary platforms for delivering lectures. On July 25, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) reported earnings for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023. The company reported earnings per share of $2.69 and outperformed EPS estimates by $0.14. The company's revenue for the quarter amounted to $56.19 billion, up 8.34% year over year. The company was ahead of Wall Street estimates for revenue by $698.86 million.\n\nUdemy, Inc. (NASDAQ:UDMY) is an online learning marketplace with thousands of courses and millions of users worldwide. It enables users to get enrolled in any course they want. Udemy, Inc. (NASDAQ:UDMY) allows users to upskill themselves while exploring their interests. Udemy, Inc. (NASDAQ:UDMY) reported $176.43 million in revenue for the first fiscal quarter of 2023, up 15.9% year over year.\n\nAnother prominent company, Duolingo, Inc. (NASDAQ:DUOL), is a leading language learning platform. Duolingo, Inc. (NASDAQ:DUOL) was incorporated in 2011 and is one of the most popular apps for learning a new language.\n\nCoursera, Inc. (NYSE:COUR) is another significant online learning platform that connects students with educators. Over the past few years, the company has grown significantly. On July 27, Coursera, Inc. (NYSE:COUR) reported earnings for the fiscal second quarter of 2023. The company generated $153.7 million in revenue, up 23.20% year over year and ahead of Wall Street estimates by $7.5 million. The company offers many professional courses in areas including UI/UX design, project management, data analysis, and cyber security.\n\nOn July 28\u00a0Jeff Maggioncalda, the CEO of Coursera, Inc. (NYSE:COUR), appeared in an interview on CNBC where he talked about the role of AI in education and Coursera's degree offerings. Maggioncalda pointed out that the total market of people that are paying for college tuition is roughly $2 trillion, \"an enormous market\". He further said that getting a college degree might not be practically feasible for everyone and that's where Coursera, Inc. (NYSE:COUR) comes in. Maggioncalda spoke about the company's collaboration with universities to create online degree programs that can earn people a college education at a considerably lower cost. Maggioncalda sees opportunity in the online degree market.\n\nRegarding leveraging AI for education, here's what Maggioncalda said:\n\n\"We're also building sort of content\u00a0generation course building tools so that\u00a0our partners can can deliver higher\u00a0quality courses you know more quickly so\u00a0for us it seemed like AI is turning out\u00a0to be a great thing and we just launched\u00a02,000 courses in seven languages for all\u00a0the non-english speaking people around\u00a0the world who want access to the\u00a0Coursera content. AI is great for\u00a0language translation...\"\n\nDespite the increasing popularity of remote education and online learning, there are still many individuals who fervently prefer the traditional experience of physical college education.

(NASDAQ:GOOGL), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), also raises serious concerns about the sustainability of the bull run.\n\nOne of the factors likely to trigger a correction into the bear territory is the extreme debt levels. According to the legendary investor, too much debt does not bode well with investors.\n\n\"[In] 2008, we had a bear market because of too much debt,\" he said. \"Look out the window since 2008, debt everywhere has skyrocketed,\u201d said Rogers in an interview with real Vision\n\nWhile not as popular as George Soros, Jim Rogers rose to prominence as he helped steer Quantum Fund into generating 4,200% returns between 1973 and 1980 outperforming S&P 500's 47% gains. He retired at the age of 37 after making so much money that he would never need to work again. After parting ways with Soros in 1980, Rogers spent most of his time travelling on a motorcycle around the world covering over 160,000 km over six contents.\n\nStory continues\n\nAfter retiring with abundant wealth, he pursued diverse interests, becoming an educator, traveling the world, and authoring several best-selling books. Rogers' investment approach involves focusing on specific countries, commodities, or themes he believes hold profit potential. While his current holdings are not publicly disclosed, he has expressed caution in buying new assets and has mentioned owning commodities, particularly gold and silver.\n\nJim Roger\u2019s net worth is believed to stand at about $300 million. He has been investing privately since leaving Quantum Fund in 1980 but does not disclose his holdings. Despite being out of the limelight for many years his experience and insights about the markets is always looked upon. Jim Rogers, often dubbed the Indiana Jones of the investing world, has a penchant for globetrotting in search of cost-effective investment opportunities.\n\nRogers, now living in Singapore with his family, made it clear that he was not buying anything as he expects bad times at the start of the year. According to the legendary investor, the next bear market will be the worst in the lifetime, exacerbated by debt that has increased too much over the past 15 years. The remarks draw up parrels to the economic conditions leading up to the devastating 2009 financial crisis. Jim Rogers's Latest Predictions and Investments\n\nTo support the predictions, the 80-year-old investors draw parallels from the inflationary crisis of 1980. Following that crisis, policymakers pursued a vigorous tightening of monetary policy, implementing substantial interest rate hikes, raising them to 21%, and pushing treasury yields to astronomical levels in an effort to counter high inflation. The outcome was the United States economy being thrust into a recession, causing significant turmoil in the stock market.\n\nWith the scenario unfolding in today\u2019s financial markets, investors ought to be extremely cautious even as the market appears to be in a strong uptrend. Rogers is already predicting trouble across all the markets, from property to stocks to bonds and currencies.\n\nJim Rogers' warning of a bear market cannot be taken lightly, given his experience in leveraging market volatility as his advantage. In partnership with George Soros, he founded Quantum Funds in 1973 and navigated the fund through multiple market downturns and economic crises.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nRogers believes it is high time investors and individuals remain vigilant and assess the risk exposure. The high debt levels and resemblance to previous crises should always be a stark reminder that market conditions can deteriorate instantly. Likewise, we have compiled Rogers biggest predictions and investment ideas from multiple sources.\n\n10. Biggest Bear Market Run of a lifetime\n\nPrediction: June 2022\n\nBest known for his contrarian investment strategy that emphasizes long-term trends, Rogers believes the world is staring at the ferocious bear run of a lifetime. In June of 2022 Rogers made that claim that the prevailing economic conditions resembled the period leading to the great financial crisis of 2008.\n\nUnlike in the past crisis, the current situation is exacerbated by extreme debt levels following the massive stimulus packages at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. The debt levels have already fueled a stubborn inflationary pressure that refuses to go away. With the FED insisting on hiking interest rates until inflation tanks below 2%, it spells more doom for an economy trying to bounce back from the COVID-19-fueled slowdown.\n\n\u201cSince 2008, the debt everywhere has skyrocketed. Gigantic increases in debt \u2026 So, I think it\u2019s a simple statement that the next bear market will be the worst in my lifetime. Because the debt has gone up by such staggering amounts in the past 14 years,\u201d Jim Rogers said in a statement.\n\n9. Governments Exacerbate Crypto Risks\n\nPrediction: August 2022\n\nAccording to the legendary investor, the biggest risk to cryptocurrencies is the government. The government wants to control everything, so they will always do everything within its power to ensure cryptocurrencies don\u2019t succeed. In August of 2022, Rogers reiterated that he will not invest in crypto even though\u00a0 his wife was a big fan and had invested in then.\n\n\u201cIf and when all our money is on our computer, it\u2019s going to be government money,\u201d he said in a recent interview with Bloomberg Crypto. \u201cThat\u2019s not the way bureaucrats think. That\u2019s not the way politicians think. They want control. They want to regulate everything.\u201d\n\nRogers does not expect the world to convert to Bitcoin or adopt cryptocurrencies as it has been touted in many circles. Even though digital assets live in the computer, it will always be government computer money, given the kind of regulations always in play.\n\nThe remarks echo the stringent regulatory scrutiny that has seen many governments try to curtail the mining and trading of cryptocurrencies. China has been at the forefront of regulations significantly hurting cryptos' sentiments and prospects.\n\nLikewise, the governments have sought to foster the development of central bank-powered decentralized cryptocurrencies that they will always be in a position to control, unlike normal cryptocurrencies.\n\n8. Inflation Will Persist for Long\n\nPrediction: September 2022\n\nThe US Federal Reserve has hiked interest rates at the fastest pace to highs of 5.5%. In the process, they have succeeded in pushing inflation from four-decade highs of 9.2% to about 3%. In September if last year Rogers reiterated inflationary pressures are far from over, even as the FED embarked on aggressive monetary tightening.\n\nAccording to Rogers inflation problem will only go away partially because governments have printed so much money in recent years. Therefore, even if it has come down significantly, it still needs to be finished.\n\nThe legendary investor has warned that a move by the central banks to hike interest rates in the race to address the inflation problem could end up being catastrophic. For starters, it could be the trigger that will end up tipping the economy into recession.\n\n7. Recession is Inevitable and going to be Bad\n\nPrediction: October 2022\n\nDue to the high inflation environment, the economy will not avoid recession, according to Jim Rogers. The fact that it has been the longest time in history that the US has struggled with serious problems heightens the prospect of the economy plunging into recession.\n\nWhile the recession might have already started, according to Rogers, it\u2019s not been bad because there have been some good things along the way. However, things are likely to turn out for the worst as debt has gone up so much over the past 15 years.\n\n6. Agriculture Key to Fighting Inflation and Recession\n\nPrediction: October 2022\n\nWhile the focus has been on emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, and cryptocurrencies, Rogers insists that agriculture will always be key. While agriculture might not seem as exciting as revolutionary technologies, it will always be an essential part of the economy and society.\n\nTherefore, Rogers believes agriculture is yet to gain the traction it deserves in the global economy, therefore, providing interesting and significant investment opportunities.\n\n\"Agriculture has been a disaster for years,\"\u00a0he said. \"And usually, if you buy a disaster, things turn out OK.\"\n\nGiven the consistent demand for food, even on soaring inflation or recession, agriculture will always provide opportunities for growth and diversification of investment portfolios. In addition, rogers believe investors should always pay close watch to housing since food and shelter are part of basic human needs.\n\nClick to continue reading and see Jim Rogers's 5 Latest Predictions and Investments.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n10 Best Rated Penny Stocks to Buy According to Analysts Billionaire Jeff Vinik's Stock Picks and 10-Year Performance 10 Stock Market Forecasts Next 6 Months\n\nDisclosure: None.\u00a0Jim Rogers's Latest Predictions and Investments is originally published on Insider Monkey.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jim-rogers-latest-predictions-investments-164505980.html", "symbols": ["AAPL.US", "AMZN.US", "GOOGL.US", "GSPC.INDX", "META.US", "MSFT.US", "NVDA.US"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": -0.997, "neg": 0.119, "neu": 0.798, "pos": 0.083}}, {"date": "2023-08-02T16:42:00+00:00", "title": "Amazon Makes a Very Consumer-Friendly Move", "content": "The retail giant has a new offer that solves a problem facing millions of Americans which Google, Warren Buffett, and others have failed to solve.\n\nContinue reading", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/m/464ed44d-bcbd-3c90-b42d-187f21e4b785/amazon-makes-a-very.html", "symbols": ["AMZ.F", "AMZ.XETRA", "AMZN.MX", "AMZN.US", "AMZO34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": -0.477, "neg": 0.194, "neu": 0.68, "pos": 0.126}}, {"date": "2023-08-02T16:18:57+00:00", "title": "Amazon begins offering grocery delivery for customers who are not Prime members", "content": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Amazon has begun offering its Fresh grocery delivery service to customers who aren\u2019t Prime members.\n\nThe initial rollout will only be available in a dozen cities, including Boston, Phoenix, Dallas and San Francisco, the company told customers Wednesday in an emailed announcement.\n\nPreviously, Amazon had only offered grocery deliveries for Prime members, who pay $139 a year for faster shipping and other perks.\n\nNon-Prime members who\u2019re interested in trying out the service will pay $13.95 for deliveries under $50. That\u2019s $4 more than Prime members have to pay for the same order size.\n\nDeliveries for orders between $50 and $100 will cost $10.95, and orders over $100 will incur a $7.95 fee. The company said pick-up orders are free from select metro areas.\n\nAmazon operates 44 Fresh grocery stores across the country, most of which are located in California, Illinois, Virginia and Washington state. It also operates more than 20 cashier-free convenience stores in the U.S. under the Amazon Go brand and owns Whole Foods, which it purchased in 2017 for $13.7 billion.\n\nBut despite its growing ambitions to be a major player in the sector, the company has encountered challenges finding the right formula for its business and gaining significant market share away from competitors like Walmart and Kroger.\n\nNeil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, said that in theory, Amazon\u2019s decision to open up grocery deliveries for non-Prime members makes sense since it enlarges its customer base, which is critical to drive growth.\n\n\u201cHowever, given that Prime membership penetration is extremely high, the scale of the upside remains to be seen and it is likely that further changes will be needed to help move the business forward,\u201d Saunders said in an emailed statement.\n\nMeanwhile, the company has also been trimming costs by closing some Amazon Fresh and Go stores and cutting hundreds of jobs as part of a restricting plan across its Whole Foods and Fresh grocery stores. It has also paused expansion on Fresh supermarkets as it aims to find the right formula that will allow it to scale its business.\n\nIn a blog post on Wednesday, the company also provided a look into two redesigned Fresh stores in Schaumburg and Oak Lawn, Illinois. It says the new format provides more product selections, low prices on more items and greater convenience during checkout.

Fitch downgraded the U.S. on Tuesday night, citing increased polarity in Washington over debt ceiling and other negotiations that point to a deterioration in governance standards. The Treasury Department pushed back at the firm's assertions.\n\nStill, it was enough to weigh on markets amid a deluge of corporate earnings reports this week.\n\nAfter raising interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point in July, the Fed could be at or near the end of its rate hiking plans. It doesn't meet again about interest rates until September, and futures traders are not unanimous on when or whether another rate hike could come. Some see rates rising another quarter of a percentage point in September, some see it in November.\n\nFed officials meet later this month for their annual conference at Jackson Hole, Wyo., where top policy makers could provide some details on where they see the economy headed in the second half of the year.\n\nHere are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:\n\n1.

Our goal has always been ... to follow customer demand and customer feedback,\" Ayogu told Yahoo Finance in an interview.\n\nIn the way a customer can purchase goods and services on Amazon, healthcare visits are now part of the product offerings. A page from Amazon's clinic site is shown on a laptop in New York on Tuesday, Aug. 1, 2023.

But this also puts Amazon in competition with legacy telehealth players like Teladoc (TDOC) and Amwell (AMWL). All three companies' stocks were down more than 6% Tuesday following the news.\n\nHealth market attempts\n\nAmazon has been trying for years to disrupt healthcare with several failed ventures in the rearview mirror. They include Haven, the disbanded joint effort with JPMorgan (JPM) and Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B). Amazon also shuttered Amazon Care, which was a similar telehealth service but for its own employees, shortly before it launched Amazon Clinic.\n\nIt also acquired OneMedical, a primary care provider that has New York City's Mount Sinai as a partner health organization, for $3.9 billion. OneMedical now offers $199 annual memberships for primary care.\n\nSimilarly, Clinic is a cash-pay offering. Virtual video visits cost $75 and messaging visits cost $35 \u2014 and Amazon does not accept insurance.\n\nAyogu said the customer base includes those who are uninsured but also underinsured \u2014 that is, those with high deductible plans.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"The reality is, accessing healthcare in this country is harder than it should be. The average wait time to see a doctor in a lot of locations is over three weeks,\" Ayogu said, noting that customers have said the Clinic is a rapid solution that is also useful for doctor visit follow-ups to get questions answered.\n\nAmazon declined to provide data that would quantify the demand for the product that resulted in its decision to expand.\n\n\"We talk a lot about price, convenience, and selection at Amazon.

All 5 have seen big rallies in 2023. None are \u201ccheap\u201d by a forward P/E basis but do investors care? It seems like valuation is irrelevant in 2023.\n\nIn addition, several of these stocks have great earnings surprise track records. Will another beat provide a catalyst to push these stocks even higher?\n\nApple, Amazon and 3 Other Key Earnings Charts\n\n1. Apple Inc. (AAPL) has an outstanding earnings surprise track record with just 1 miss in the last 5 years. It happened in early 2023 but that didn\u2019t stop shares of Apple from rallying throughout 2023. Apple has hit new all-time highs this year and is up 50.6%. Apple is expensive, from what it has traded at historically. It has a forward P/E of 32.6. Does its valuation keep you out of Apple?\n\n2. Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) has put together 2 big beats in a row but has always had a hit-or-miss earnings surprise track record. Shares of Amazon have rallied big, gaining 57% year-to-date. Amazon is not cheap. It trades at 85.4x. But it has never been cheap, even after big sell-offs like last year. Is Amazon still undervalued?\n\n3. Booking Holdings, Inc. (BKNG) has beat 10 quarters in a row. That\u2019s an impressive record for a travel company during the pandemic. Shares of Booking are up 44.6% year-to-date. It\u2019s the cheapest of these 5 companies with a forward P/E of 22. Booking is trading near its all-time highs. Will Booking break out on this report?\n\n4. Airbnb, Inc. (ABNB) has beat 8 quarters in a row. If you recall, Airbnb was a pandemic IPO. It went public in late 2020. Shares of Airbnb have rallied this year, gaining 74%. Airbnb isn\u2019t cheap either, with a forward P/E of 44.3. With travel so hot, should Airbnb be on your shortlist?\n\nStory continues\n\n5. DraftKings Inc. (DKNG) is coming off a miss last quarter, but prior to that miss, it had beat 5 quarters in a row. Shares of DraftKings have soared 179% year-to-date. DraftKings doesn\u2019t have a P/E because it\u2019s expected to lose $1.81 per share this year but that is an improvement from its loss of $3.16 last year. Will this earnings report be a further catalyst for DraftKings\u2019 shares?\n\n[In full disclosure, Tracey owns shares of AMZN and BKNG in her personal portfolio.]\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nApple\n\nApple has an Earnings ESP of +0.66% and a Zacks Rank #3. Apple saw positive earnings estimate revision of a penny over the past 30 days for the fiscal third quarter. Analysts raising estimates right before earnings \u2014 with the most up-to-date information possible \u2014 is a good indicator for the stock. The iPhone maker has a strong track record of positive earnings surprise. It delivered an average earnings surprise of 2.65% in the trailing four quarters.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates a modest year-over-year decrease of 0.8% for earnings and 2% for revenues (see: all the Technology ETFs here).\r\n\r\nThe stock belongs to a top-ranked Zacks Industry (top 43%) and has a solid Growth Score of B.

Below, we have highlighted five ETFs having the largest exposure to these giants.\r\n\r\nVanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF (MGK)\r\n\r\nVanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF tracks the CRSP US Mega Cap Growth Index. It holds 96 securities in its basket, with the in-focus two firms collectively accounting for 22.5% of the total assets. It has key holdings in technology and consumer discretionary that account for double-digit exposure each (read: 5 Growth ETFs at New Highs to Start 2H).\r\n\r\nVanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF charges 7 basis points in annual fees and trades in a good volume of around 281,000 shares a day on average.

The three in-focus firms account for a combined 24% share in the basket.\r\n\r\nRoundhill BIG Tech ETF has amassed $3.8 million in its asset base and charges 29 bps in fees per year. It trades in an average daily volume of 5,000 shares.\r\n\r\nMicroSectors FANG+ ETN (FNGS)\r\n\r\nThis ETN is linked to the performance of the NYSE FANG+ Index, which is equal-dollar weighted and designed to provide exposure to a group of highly traded growth stocks of next-generation technology and tech-enabled companies. The note accounts for a 10% share in each of the two stocks (read: Best & Worst ETF Areas of First Half 2023).\r\n\r\nMicroSectors FANG+ ETN has accumulated $138.9 million in its asset base and charges 58 bps in annual fees. It trades in a moderate volume of 178,000 shares a day on average and has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold).\r\n\r\nInvesco QQQ Trust (QQQ)\r\n\r\nInvesco QQQ Trust provides exposure to the 101 largest domestic and international non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq by tracking the Nasdaq 100 Index.

You can skip our detailed analysis on the subject and head over directly to the 5 Most Educated States in America.\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics, in a report in 2022, established the direct link between educational attainment and income levels in the United States. Earnings rise as you further climb the ladder in terms of education. An individual with less than a high school diploma makes $682 per week, on average, compared to $1,432 for someone holding a bachelor\u2019s degree, $1,661 for master\u2019s degree, and over $2,000 per week for those with professional or doctoral degrees.\n\nMassachusetts is the most educated state in America, with 46.6% of its population aged 25 and above holding a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher. Moreover, close to one-thirds of its youth in the age group of 18-24 years have completed some college or associate's degree. The Bureau of Labor Statistics' report linking education to income levels is validated by the fact that Massachusetts is also one of the 20 Wealthiest States in America, ranked seventh, with over 250,000 millionaires and 20 billionaires. Massachusetts is also home to the Ivy League Harvard University, established in 1636 in Cambridge, a major suburb in the Greater Boston area.\n\nIn contrast, West Virginia is the least educated state in America. Only 24.1% of the population in the age bracket analyzed for this research have attained higher education, of which 14.2% have completed bachelor's degree, while only 9.9% hold a graduate or professional degree.\n\nAn article last year identified companies that were playing their roles in driving down the cost of education to make it more accessible for all. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of them. The tech giant\u2019s AWS on-demand cloud computing platform provides digital infrastructure support for many online educational companies, and helps them scale up their ability to handle more activity on their platforms.\n\nStory continues\n\nUnder its latest Project Kuiper, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is launching more than 3,000 satellites into orbit with the aim to provide affordable broadband around the world, and in particular, to communities that are underserved. There is great hope for Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u2019s initiative to help make education more cost effective for all by using technology and internet.\n\nInternational Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)\u2019s P-TECH program is a fine example of how public-private partnership can help drive education in societies. It is an initiative by International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) to prepare youth with the academic, professional, and technical knowledge and skills required to excel in the 21st century. In addition to this, International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) in 2021 announced an ambitious commitment and plan to provide 30 million people with the future skills required in the job market by 2030.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), on the other hand, offers students and teachers at educational institutions including schools, colleges, and universities to sign up for its Office 365 Education, which will grant them free access to Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u2019s top services like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Publisher, and Teams.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u2019s TechSpark program has also been instrumental in facilitating digital access and skills in rural areas of the United States. This partnership between Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and education leaders is a significant step towards ensuring that students can be as prepared for the future as they can be.\n\nMethodology\n\nThe 20 most educated states in America have been ranked based on the percentage of their populations aged 25 and above that hold a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher. Data has been sourced from The Census Bureau\u2019s American Community Survey 2021. States are ranked in ascending order of percentages. In the case of two or more states having the same percentage, one outranked the other based on college education levels in those states.\n\nIf interested, you can also take a look at the 20 Least Educated States in America here. 20 Most Educated States in America\n\nSyda Productions/Shutterstock.com\n\nHere are the 20 most educated states in America.\n\n20.

Ready\n\nThanks, Neil, and thank you all for joining our second quarter 2023 earnings call. Q2 was a solid quarter marked by strong growth across our business. We're seeing ongoing momentum, giving us continued confidence that our strategy is yielding results with more potential as we look ahead. We ended the quarter with 465 million MAUs, up 8%. Our total revenue was $708 million, growing 6% or 7% on a constant currency basis. We stayed disciplined with our expenses and delivered adjusted EBITDA of $107 million and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 15%.\r\nBefore we dive into the key highlights from Q2 I'd like to share more about what we've accomplished over the last year since I joined and why I'm excited for the opportunities ahead. During this time, we've become laser focused on our strategy of building upon our core differentiators and visual discovery to help our users go from inspiration to action. With that focus on our strategic priorities, we've successfully returned to strong user and engagement growth while delivering consistent year-on-year revenue growth and returning to margin expansion despite the downturn in the advertising environment.\r\nOn the engagement side, we've utilized next-generation AI technologies to surface more relevant and personalized content and improve ad relevance, driven more intent to action and focused our content strategy to bring actionable content from a range of sources, including users, creators, publishers and retailers. As a result, monthly active users have grown more than 30 million over the last 12 months. Our users are also coming back more frequently and are engaging more deeply. Engagement metrics such as sessions, impressions and saves grew substantially faster than our users across all of our regions over the same period. It's worth noting that we have seen these engagement gains over the past year during a period where we have also grown our ad load on the platform, proving that relevant ads, including lower funnel ad formats, can be good content for users in a unique setting like ours with high commercial intent.\r\nWe continue to see significant benefits and momentum from whole page optimization and ongoing improvements to our ads quality, targeting and relevancy. We increased our focus on making Pinterest more shoppable by integrating shopping into the core experiences of our platform. We're now seeing strong growth in engagement with shopping related content on our core surfaces. And for the past 4 quarters, shopping ads revenue has grown multiples of our total revenue growth. I believe we are just scratching the surface when it comes to monetizing lower funnel behavior on Pinterest. \r\nImportantly, we also accelerated innovation on behalf of our advertisers, tripling the number of ad product formats released so far this year versus last and introducing important measurement solutions that prove our value to advertisers. We are seeing revenue from advertisers who take advantage of these measurement tools to grow significantly faster, a positive sign for the future as we increase adoption of these tools among our customer base.\r\nWe also opened our platform to third-party demand partners, starting with Amazon Ads platform. To summarize, I'm very proud of what we've accomplished over the last year, and we're just getting started. We look forward to sharing more details and a comprehensive update on our strategy during our Investor Day, taking place in San Francisco on September 19. \r\nWith that backdrop, I'll now move on to the progress we've made in the second quarter, advancing our strategic priorities and driving the business forward. First, I'd like to discuss how we are deepening engagement with our existing users and growing new users in Q2, driven by our AI efforts in relevance and personalization as well as a clear focus on satisfaction of user intent. In Q2, our global MAUs grew 8%, while our mobile app MAUs, which account for over 80% of our revenue and impressions grew 16%. In addition, our U-Can mobile app MAUs grew 9%, accelerating from Q1. Our users were also visiting us more frequently. The basket of metrics that we use to measure engagement, such as sessions, impressions and saves grew significantly faster than MAUs in Q2 in all regions, consistent with the trends we have observed the last 4 quarters. To help bring this to life, I'd like to share a few examples of how we are driving engagement on the platform, starting with how we are implementing AI to better serve our users. \r\nNearly a year ago, we began moving to next-gen AI capabilities, enabling us to use recommender models that were 100x larger than before. We combined our first-party proprietary data with our AI-based computer vision and search technologies to improve the perceived relevance for recommendations on related pins, driving proceed relevance up by nearly 10 points from a year ago to 94%. This means that when users are searching for something on Pinterest, we are returning results that they find relevant and helpful and we're doing this with a very high degree of accuracy.\r\nMore recently, as we have continued to focus on what our users really want from us, we've incorporated into our AI models more signals from our platform. As an example, in the first half of this year, we unlocked further engagement gains by incorporating propensity to share into our AI recommender models. By recommending content that users are more likely to share, we improved retention of our core users, and we grew revisits from dormant users as they are more likely to engage with recommended content from people they know. \r\nIn Q2, another source of engagement gains came from the launch of our new guided browsing experience, designed to help episodic users rediscover existing use cases and find their next project or passion on Pinterest. This experience adds a set of horizontal images across the home feeds grid, where we can show more content based on the user's intent. The valuable signals we get from this new browsing module helps to optimize the user experience for previous or new use cases and deliver more relevant shopping experiences. We've seen a meaningful lift in revisitation as a result. \r\nAs we continue to focus on improving the inspiration to action journey for users across our platform, we're seeing users explore more interest outside of our core home, food, fashion and beauty verticals, and with strong growth in the number of MAUs engaging with emerging verticals such as men's fashion, autos, health and travel in the first half of this year. \r\nLastly, we continue to see strong growth with Gen Z users on Pinterest, who in Q2 were our largest contributor to overall engagement growth and the fastest growing cohort growing double digits and accounting for a larger portion of our overall mix. In particular, we found that our Gen Z users consistently engage more deeply on the platform than our older cohorts, as measured by their saves and close up activity on the platform. \r\nNext, I'd like to discuss how we are improving monetization by making Pinterest more valuable for advertisers as a full funnel platform. These ad offerings allow us to reach a broader set of advertisers to diversify and grow our revenue base, and also help us deliver improved results to our advertisers based on their performance criteria. First, let's start with how we are innovating at the lower end of the funnel, where we are helping retailers gain customers, not just transactions. \r\nIn July, we brought our mobile deep linking product or MDL to general availability, opening up this highly performant offering to more advertisers. MDL is a great fit for retailers who want to drive users to purchase an item on their mobile app and has been a significant driver of our shopping ads revenue growth over the past 9 months. \r\nBy taking what we've learned through MDL, we are planning to expand our lower funnel offerings to include more seamless one-click site handoffs in the back half of this year. This gives retailers who don't have a stand-alone app or prefer to do a one-click handoff directly to their site, the flexibility to choose what works best for their objectives. \r\nTravel catalogs are another format we debuted in the quarter, allowing advertisers to reach users who are in the midst of planning, organizing and taking action on their travel dreams. It's built on our product catalog technology and automatically turns each listing into a dynamic product pin with relevant booking information such as hotel name, pricing, images and descriptions. \r\nAs an example, TUI, one of the world's leading tourism groups based in Germany added travel catalogs to their full funnel strategy to drive more users to their available hotel listings. In Q2, their campaign yielded strong results with a 6x higher outbound click-through rate and an 80% lower outbound cost per click than they were seeing in previous conversion campaigns. Furthermore, we made good headway with helping advertisers measure the efficacy of their campaigns on Pinterest. Since introducing our conversion API in Q4, we've steadily grown the percentage of revenue from advertisers who adopted our conversion API solution. \r\nIn addition to innovating on the lower funnel, we'll also continue to innovate on upper funnel ad formats to build on our strength in that segment of the market and meet advertiser demand. In June, we made our Premier Spotlight ad format, which is our upper funnel takeover video ad unit on our search surface available for all advertisers. We're seeing early adoption from a large number of brand advertisers such as Max, formerly known as HBO Max, and Comcast Xfinity. \r\nSimilar to last quarter, in Q2, we continued to drive a more than 30% increase in our global ad impressions or monetizable supply, due to engagement gains and dynamically flexing ad load when a user is expressing intent through whole page optimization. We are also leveraging next-gen AI on our ad products and we're seeing a profound impact in our ad capabilities.\r\nIn Q2, we expanded our use of GPU serving from core engagement AI models to our ad delivery models, which enabled us to use models that are 100x larger than before in ads as well as organic. The cumulative impact was a 5% reduction in cost per action and over 10% lift in click-through rates. I'm very proud of our team's execution on the monetization side, but we are still early in our ad platform evolution. I believe third-party partnerships can be additive by expanding the depth of advertisers, bringing more relevant ads and improving our auction density. We announced our first third-party partnership with Amazon ads in April. This partnership has strong synergies. As Pinterest has significant commercial intent and consumer desire to go for inspiration to action, while Amazon ads can bring more shoppable content with a great consumer buying experience.\r\nAs I said on our last call, a partnership of this scale will be a multi-quarter implementation with the most meaningful revenue impacts likely being in early 2024. However, we have recently begun testing live traffic with Amazon ads. We are very pleased with the pace of implementation in Q2 and the early results of our testing in Q3 so far.\r\nLooking at our overall progress on shopping, we're quite excited at the momentum we're generating. We're building a powerful flywheel that is driving increased engagement among our users and delivering greater value to our advertisers. We're utilizing next-gen AI models with our first-party signal to recommend brands and products that are aligned with user preferences, and this is resonating with users. \r\nIn Q1, we continued to grow the overall distribution of Shuffle pins or products you can take action on, on the home feed. And in Q2, we've expanded this to all of our core surfaces. Users are actively engaging with this content with click-through rates and saves of Shuffle pins growing over 50%, accelerating from the 35% we saw in Q1. \r\nIn Q2, we also launched a new automated shop to look module for home decor and fashion pins that utilizes AI to recommend similar shoppable products tied to our merchant catalogs. In our early A/B tests, shop to look is unlocking greater value for merchants as this high-intent traffic drove a 9% increase in conversions. And these innovations continue to manifest and robust shopping ads revenue, which continue to grow at a pace meaningfully faster than our overall revenue rate. \r\nNow I'd like to discuss our focus on operational rigor. As we've said in the past, we're instilling a culture where we are more focused on what drives results for users and advertisers and being more rigorous with our expenses, ultimately making us a more durable company. We've been able to accelerate our pace of innovation while also being disciplined on expense management, resulting in positive outcomes for our users, advertisers and shareholders.\r\nIn Q1, we took steps to reduce our expenses and drive greater efficiencies in our business, including rightsizing our workforce to align talent to our strategic priorities and restructuring our real estate portfolio. In Q2, we identified further cost efficiencies, leading to operating expenses that were lower than we guided to. Later in the prepared remarks, Julia will share our latest outlook on expenses and margin expansion year. \r\nFinally, I'd like to talk about our progress in making Pinterest a more positive place on the Internet. Our commitment to fostering a more positive environment resonates with advertisers. We believe our relative brand safety remains a driver for advertisers to invest more and spend on Pinterest. Our efforts and positivity also resonate with users. For example, we are building inclusive AI technology, like skin tone diversification, that helps users personalize their experience and see themselves on Pinterest. In Q2, we improved the skin tone diversification of our core feeds, which led to engagement wins. \r\nWe want others to join us on our mission to make the Internet a more positive place. In June, we created the inspired Internet pledge in collaboration with the Digital Wellness lab at Boston Children's Hospital. The pledge is the call to action for tech companies and the broader digital ecosystem to unite with the common goal of making the Internet a safer and healthier place for everyone, especially young people.\r\nBefore turning the call over, I wanted to say a few words about our new CFO, Julia Donnelly, and why I'm so excited to partner with her going forward. We ran an extensive search for a CFO, and I know Julia is the right leader and partner to help our team grow and scale Pinterest. Prior to joining, Julia was VP of Finance and Accounting at Wayfair, where she was responsible for the entire global finance and accounting organizations as well as Investor Relations and Corporate Development. She is a strategic, disciplined and highly regarded executive with an impressive background leading all aspects of finance within an innovative, high-growth public company. Her leadership and deep experience across e-commerce, media and technology will be invaluable as we position ourselves for the next chapter at Pinterest. \r\nI'll now turn the call over to Julia to provide an update on our Q2 financial performance.\n\nJulia Brau Donnelly\n\nThank you, Bill, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm thrilled to join the Pinterest team. As you can imagine, it's been a busy and exciting few weeks since I joined in late June. First, I'd like to discuss a few of the reasons why I came to Pinterest and why I'm even more excited about the opportunity ahead.\r\nBefore joining, I followed Pinterest extensively as a beloved brand with an inspiring and positive consumer app and a strong financial model. From my previous role, I have also watched Pinterest become an incredibly performant and innovative advertising platform. Coming from what I would consider a best-in-class e-commerce advertiser, I've had first-hand experience and how Pinterest is uniquely able to help marketers find users who are in the midst of an inspiration journey, where they're looking to buy, but not quite sure what they want and then ultimately take action to bring that to life.\r\nOver the last few weeks, sitting inside the company, I can attest to the excitement and energy from our team on everything we are building for our users and advertisers. I'm honored to take on the CFO role and join the management team at Pinterest to continue building on this momentum. Leveraging my background in e-commerce, I look forward to helping us navigate through this exciting next chapter of growth, capturing the significant revenue potential ahead through strong operating execution and sound investments. Looking ahead, I'm excited to develop a productive dialogue with the shareholder and analyst community as well as sharing more about progress to date and future potential ahead at our Investor Day in September.\r\nNow turning to our results in the second quarter. In my remarks today, I'll discuss our Q2 financial performance and provide our preliminary outlook for Q3. All financial metrics, except for revenue, will be discussed in non-GAAP terms unless otherwise specified, and all comparisons will be discussed on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. \r\nAs Bill mentioned, our investments in AI and new user experiences drove strong engagement on our platform in Q2, resulting in 465 million global monthly active users, an increase of over 30 million users over the last 12 months. We grew monthly active users 8% on a year-over-year basis globally, the highest growth we've seen during the last 2 years. \r\nIn the U.S. and Canada, monthly active users were 95 million, up 3%. In Europe, monthly active users were 124 million, up 6%. And in our rest of world markets, monthly active users were 246 million, up 10%. Underlying our monthly active user metric, we had even faster growth in engagement as measured by sessions, impressions and saves, which is a testament to the work we're doing around deepening engagement with our users, and I'm excited about the progress we're making with Gen Z users, which was our fastest-growing segment and an important and influential demographic for marketers in many of our core verticals.\r\nTurning to our financial performance. Global revenue for the second quarter came in at $708 million, growing 6% or 7% on a constant currency basis. U.S. and Canada revenue was $565 million, an increase of 4%. Europe revenue was $114 million, growing 12% on both a reported and constant currency basis. Revenue from Rest of World was $29 million, growing 32% or 35% on a constant currency basis. We're pleased to see global year-over-year revenue growth continued to strengthen this quarter versus Q1 '23 and Q4 '22. A testament that while the ad market remains somewhat choppy, advertisers continue to turn to Pinterest because of our highly attractive user demographics, relative brand-safe environment and the strong return on ad spend we can deliver. \r\nDuring the quarter, at the top of the funnel, we saw strength and awareness objectives as many brand advertisers, particularly CPG advertisers, were able to meet their goals given our engagement gains and attractive pricing. Contributing to this growth were video ads and our new premier Spotlight takeover ad unit. At the bottom of the funnel this quarter, strength came from larger, more sophisticated advertisers who leaned into our shopping ads format, driven by adoption of mobile deep linking and our conversion API. However, we also experienced headwinds from those who have yet to adopt our measurement tools and pockets of distressed retail advertisers. \r\nFinally, across all parts of the funnel, we continue to gain good traction with advertisers in emerging verticals such as travel, autos and financial services, helping us further diversify our advertiser base outside of our traditional areas of strength. \r\nIn terms of overall auction dynamics in the second quarter, ad supply grew more than 30%, driven by engagement gains and opening up supply through whole page optimization, and the price of ads declined 20%, due primarily to a softer pricing environment across all geographies.\r\nMoving down the P&L. Cost of revenue was $164 million, up 1% year-over-year and down 2% quarter-over-quarter versus Q1. This is the third quarter in a row of sequential declines in our cost of revenue line item as our teams implemented a number of efficiency projects across storage and compute infrastructure. It has been exciting to see how we can realize these efficiencies in our cost of revenue even while we drive significant engagement gains and ad stack innovation and leverage AI throughout our business.\r\nOverall, our non-GAAP operating expense was $440 million, up 5% year-over-year and up 7% sequentially versus Q1. This was below our guidance as we were able to drive more cost efficiencies, particularly in our R&D and G&A functions while also shifting some of our marketing spend from Q1 into Q2. \r\nAdjusted EBITDA had a very strong quarter, coming in at $107 million or a 15% margin, up 130 basis points year-over-year, driven by increased revenue, efficiency in our cost of revenue and operating expense discipline. This quarter, we successfully completed our $500 million stock repurchase program, well ahead of the 12-month plan to complete the program as we saw openings to be opportunistic with our purchases during the quarter. We continue to be mindful of managing dilution. Capital allocation will be a topic at our upcoming Investor Day, and we look forward to sharing more details at that time.\r\nFinally, we ended the quarter with approximately $2.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.\r\nNow I'd like to provide preliminary financial guidance for the third quarter. While the overall digital ads market appears to be stabilizing, the recovery remains uneven with pockets of strength and weakness. We expect Q3 revenue to grow in the high single-digits range year-over-year. Based on what we are seeing right now, we expect to land towards the middle of that range, which would represent a moderate acceleration from the growth rate we saw in Q2. This includes a small impact from foreign exchange, which is reflected in our guide. \r\nTurning to expenses. We expect Q3 non-GAAP operating expenses to grow in the low single-digits range year-over-year. Please note that our operating expense guidance does not include cost of revenue. As we have noted previously, we are committed to expanding adjusted EBITDA margins in full year 2023 on the order of a couple of hundred basis points year-over-year in any state of the world. Based on the revenue acceleration and the expense outlook provided above, we believe the adjusted EBITDA we expect to deliver in Q3 puts us on the path to double that prior commitment, resulting in roughly 400 basis points of year-over-year adjusted EBITDA margin expansion for full year 2023. \r\nWe feel good about the progress we've made on users, engagement and monetization while also maintaining cost discipline to ensure we are investing in areas with clear line of sight to strong returns to capture the sizable revenue potential we see ahead. \r\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Bill for a few final words.\n\nWilliam J. Ready\n\nThanks, Julia. I'm proud of our team's execution to deliver strong results in Q2. And I'm confident that we're making the appropriate investments to provide great experiences for our users and more value for advertisers. I want to thank our teams at Pinterest, our advertising partners and all the people that come to Pinterest to find inspiration.\r\nAnd with that, we can open the call up for questions.\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs.\n\nEric James Sheridan\n\nMaybe 2, if I could. Bill, first for you. You talked a lot about product and platform iteration and there's also a lot of talk about the current advertising environment. Can you talk a little bit about when you think about the elements of revenue reacceleration that are building in your business, how much are elements that are within your control based on things you're building and sort of executing on inside the business versus elements of volatility down to the broader ad environment or macro environment that are somewhat out of your control? And then the second one, Julia, first, congrats on the new role. I look forward to working with you going forward. I wanted to come back to your comments during your prepared remarks and just delve a little bit deeper in what you see as some of the big opportunities or agenda items that you want to tackle in this role as the CFO at Pinterest?\n\nWilliam J. Ready\n\nThanks for the questions, Eric. So to your first question, on what we can control and what's sort of in the broader environment. The broader environment is seeing some stabilization and some signs of recovery, but there's still a lot of puts and takes and a lot of choppiness out there. Direct example of that is if you look at pricing impact, which would be sort of a direct evidence of sort of softness in the ad market, that's down 20% year-on-year for us, that's pretty consistent with what you see across other large platforms, some of which have had year-on-year declines last year and year-on-year declines again this year that were double-digit plus or 15 percentage point plus. So you have this pretty strong pricing headwind, which is just the element of like softness in the broader market. And so while there is some signs of stabilization in pockets of recovery, there's still choppiness as evidenced by both us and other major platforms with that pretty material headwind on pricing.\r\nBut if you look at -- to your question of what we can control there, we feel fantastic about the progress that we're making. And the things in our control, most noteworthy, the return to user growth. We just put up our largest user growth quarter in 2-plus years, deepening engagement on the platform. We've talked about how, given the high commerciality of what users do on our platform that we can take ad load much higher than what it has been that ads in a commercial context can be really relevant content. And so we can take ad load higher even while driving deeper engagement, and you see that evidence in our result. That's a really unique thing in the ad world to be able to do that. \r\nAnd particularly in social media, where ads tend to sort of take the user away from what they're trying to do because they're more of an entertainment mode. Here, because we have the user in a lean forward intent mode, we are demonstrating through our whole page optimization work and our dynamic ad load that we've been able to take ad load up 30% -- or drive 30%-plus lift in impressions, part of that driven by growth in user engagement, but a big part of that driven by increasing ad load while engagement is up, meaning we're proving out those ads as relevant content. So I think that, coupled with the advertiser side of this, where as they're getting more adoption of our measurement tools, they continuously as they adopt our latest measurement tools, spend more and tend to be much faster growers than those on the rest of our platform. \r\nI've shared this in some prior remarks later in the quarter -- this past quarter that those that have adopted our measurement tools tend to grow on the order of 30% year-on-year. Those that have not yet adopted or mid-single-digit decline. So as we're driving that adoption curve, that headwind will increasingly flip around to tailwind for us. And so those are things that are in our control. But again, if you step back from it, give us lots of confidence in where we're going. And I think it's why if you step all the way back, and you look at us versus the broader ad market, we're one of the only major ad platforms that has grown consistently every quarter through the downturn in the ad market, and why we're seeing acceleration quarter-on-quarter. \r\nAnd while that acceleration is moderate, when you look at the 20 point-plus headwind on pricing and the fact that we're one of the only consistent growers through the downturn, I think that speaks to the really positive progress on the platform. And then final point, I'd just say a year ago, one of the big questions was would shopping work on the platform. We had user research to send more than half the users here to shop, the wood shopping work on the platform. And there, I think our results just could not be more encouraging. We talked about 50%-plus year-on-year improvement in engagement with shoppable content, as we brought shoppable content on to our main surfaces. \r\nAnd that's accelerating quarter-on-quarter from 35% last quarter. So that as an indicator of the commerciality of our platform and what we can do for advertisers I think, again, just gives us tremendous optimism and what we can't predict when the sort of pricing headwinds in the broader ad market alleviate or turn back into a tailwind, we've been able to deliver really solid growth even with a 20-point plus headwind. And I'll give it to Julia for your second question.\n\nJulia Brau Donnelly\n\nYes. Thanks, Eric, for the question. I appreciate it. So first, let me start with just a couple of observations. It's been obviously an exciting few weeks here for me at Pinterest. And from my prior seat, I heard a lot about Pinterest and the exciting pace of innovation that was taking place. Now that I'm on the inside, it's great to see that many other advertisers are really recognizing the same. When I first got here, the teams have just gotten back from Can. They were talking about the buzz and momentum from agencies and advertisers about all the ad products we're building. As we mentioned earlier, we've actually tripled the number of ad formats released so far this year versus last year. And we're really accelerating the pace of ad stack innovation meaningfully as we described earlier. So that's starting to really get recognized by the broader advertiser community, which is great to see.\r\nThe second observation I'd have is just how impressed I've been, early in here just the level of engineering and product talent that we have inside the company here, particularly in our AI functions. We have really world-class AI teams that have -- Pinterest has been a talent magnet on that front. So I'm impressed to see and learn how embedded AI actually is in virtually every aspect of our platform today. And if you think about sort of agenda items and where we go from here, obviously, I'm very excited about the direction that this team already has taken a company and that's a big part of why I chose to join and help build on that momentum. I'd say we've made some real progress over the last year, but my -- where he looks forward to partnering with the team is continuing to make sure we're driving those investments in areas with really clear line of sight to returns where we're investing in that growth to capture the revenue opportunity but also doing so profitably and looking to drive that operating leverage over time.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays.\n\nRoss Adam Sandler\n\nBill, so we're starting to see these really nice SKU-level ads from Amazon showing up in the app. And you just mentioned that you guys have been able to increase ad loads pretty nicely even before turning these on. So I guess can you just talk about like how you think about ad load, the ceiling to ad load if there is one? And then how these new Amazon ads compare from a pricing perspective to the directly sold Pinterest ads? And then the second question is just on the new categories, the travel, financial services, auto, just how you guys are viewing? I know it's early, but how are you viewing those non-endemic categories in terms of potential opportunity in the next couple of years?\n\nWilliam J. Ready\n\nThanks, Ross. So on your point on the Amazon ads partnership, as I've said before, we really believe that the commerciality on our platform can allow us to take ad load much higher. We don't break our ad load specifically, but we've talked about the 30% plus growth in monetizable supply, which is meaningfully faster than our engagement growth overall. That's really been driven by bringing more relevant shoppable content onto the platform for users. So Amazon as a partner we're quite encouraged that they can bring more of that shoppable content plus a great buying experience for users. \r\nAnd so while it's a multi-quarter implementation and again, a reminder that the biggest element of that revenue, we expect to start hitting in early '24, we're really pleased with the pace of implementation. And in those early results, I expanded a bit on those early results that we're so happy about -- one of the biggest things we're happy about is that we're seeing improvement and relevancy even beyond what we're already very optimistic expectations on our side. And so as we see that it's contributing to more relevant shopping content that further bolsters our view that we can take ad load much higher. And if you compared to other analogs that I've seen in past life and that you all could see as you sort of count ad load or add slots on other sort of shopping experiences, ad load provided we have the right relevancy, ad load can be a multiple of what it is today for our users, particularly when users are in commercial context and more than half the users are here to shop. \r\nSo I think that says that there is still a lot more -- a lot more runway ahead, quite a high ceiling for where we can go with ad load and the fact that we've already been growing at 30% plus year-on-year in terms of overall monetizable supply while also increasing engagement is proving out that theory of the case that we can grow ad load while also making it relevant engagement driving content for our users. So we feel really good about all that. \r\nAnd then to your second question on new categories and how we're seeing those sort of previously non-endemic categories, across Pinterest, we talked about the uniqueness of Pinterest being that it's a great full funnel platform where people would go from inspiration to action. But we knew that actionability was historically a weaker part of the platform, as we've been bringing in more satisfaction of intent, more ability to go from intent to action, we're seeing that, that is resonating across categories, across verticals. And so a few that we mentioned, like travel, auto, men's fashion, we're seeing that as we're doing more to create satisfaction of intent, that is applying well across other categories. \r\nTravel is probably the most noteworthy I mentioned in my prepared remarks, travel is quite a large ad market overall. People have always dreamed about travel on Pinterest. But again, like shopping, the actionability was lower. As we've taken our work in shopping applied a lot of that base technology to travel and opened up a travel catalog as we now have made more of those travel ads and clickable and engageable by the user with things like pricing information availability, we're seeing that intent to action effort is driving really good results with users and with advertisers. So I think that's quite encouraging that while we still have tremendous runway to go in shopping, there are other meaningful categories and verticals on Pinterest, and so we're quite excited about that. \r\nFinally, I would just say on the organic side of that, I mentioned some of what we're doing around helping to nudge users into other use cases. I think this is one of the things we've seen historically is that Pinterest could at times be more episodic for some users, and we've been leveraging some of our AI capabilities and some of our product experiences to now nudge users towards other relevant categories for them. And we're finding that is working really well. So we think there's a lot more runway to go there.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley with UBS.\n\nLloyd Wharton Walmsley\n\nA couple for me on the partner monetization side, if I can. First, it sounds like Amazon partnership is progressing faster than you guys expected. What are the big outstanding blocks you need to get through to scale that? And as you think about potentially adding other partners, like are those things that would need to get redone from scratch? Or is this more foundational platform efforts? And then second one, the partnership you guys announced with Aleph, how meaningful could that contribution ultimately grow to? And in markets where you have their sales force helping you and other third parties, how will you kind of toggle between those sorts of go-to-market and Aleph?\n\nWilliam J. Ready\n\nThanks for the question, Lloyd. So on the partnership with Amazon and sort of your broader comments on bringing on third-party demand, as we said, yes, we are very pleased with the pace of implementation and even more importantly, pleased with the significant improvement in relevancy and what that says about the long-term potential of that partnership. And so a couple of things I would note. You asked about the pace there. Yes, we are pacing ahead of expectations. At the same time, as we get relevancy really right that places a much higher ceiling on the long-term potential of the partnership. So in the near term, we're making sure that even though we're really pleased with the pace and the progress and the results, then we want to make sure we do that in a methodical way getting the relevancy really right for the user because as we do that, that gives us a much higher long-term ceiling. \r\nSo we're not going to sort of sacrifice the long term to sort of go faster than is necessary in the short term, but we are seeing really positive progress there. And I'd say our long-term view of that partnership just continues to expand, even though we want to be careful not to get ahead of ourselves in terms of revenue contribution for this year. We do think that when you step back and say, our big opportunity here is about making our platform shoppable content to users. What we're seeing there, extraordinarily encouraging. I think the ceiling only continues to lift as you look at the long term there. And the pacing again is better than where we had expected. \r\nYou had asked about other partners. We've mentioned this previously, we do expect to have multiple partners to help us bring in engaging relevant content, ad demand for our users. We're focused on making sure we get this first one really right. But we are building in a way that will help to sort of agree the skids for others. And so we do think as we land this one really well, and that's tracking well, and we start to look towards other potential partners that we're building this in a way that is repeatable, and will help us continue to accelerate as we think about where we go forward. But again, we're going to make sure we get this one really right, particularly getting that user relevancy right because if we get that right, then the ability to go take that ad load up much higher while still deepening engagement with users is really the longer-term potential here. And again, all signals there are encouraging even beyond our prior expectations. \r\nYou asked about what we're doing with Aleph and how meaningful that could be. So for that, as we think about international, we do think that our international monetization is a big opportunity for us. This past year, we had to really focus on making sure that we made some meaningful updates to our user experience and our ad capabilities in our largest markets, which are highly competitive, and so we feel good about the progress we made on that. \r\nWe did start to make some focused investment in the international, particularly with agencies and partners that can help us drive more distribution and meeting our advertisers where they are. And so as we have leaned into agency deals and partners that can help us distribute internationally, we have seen those have performed quite well without speaking to any one specific partner, we've seen that those have been growing at a much faster rate of revenue than what we would see otherwise. So we think there's a lot more yield in that. \r\nAnd as we look into '24, we think international that has probably been under monetized across the board, we have been even more undermonetized internationally, and so I think we have some really encouraging proof points to say there's a lot more we can lean into international monetization as we go into '24, particularly with partners like Aleph and others that can help us accelerate that distribution.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore.\n\nMark Stephen F. Mahaney\n\nOkay. I want to ask about the 2 things: the LLM models, the impact you've seen in terms of cost per action, reduced cost per action and lift in CTRs. I would assume these are still kind of early stage results for you. Could you talk maybe about what kind of long-term impact you could see? Or is that kind of in the unknown knowns? How much better do you think the application of large language models to Pinterest -- much more of an improvement could you see on both the user and the advertiser side? \r\nAnd then one specific question about this data point you provided, I don't know, a month ago about how 10% of your advertisers were -- had adopted your measurement tools, and they're growing 30% year-over-year in terms of their ad spend with you. Where are those 2 numbers now? And like what's a reasonable expectation for when 10% gets to 50%?\n\nWilliam J. Ready\n\nThanks, Mark. Appreciate the questions. So on LLM models, 2 things are simultaneously true: One is we are seeing tremendous benefit, and we are pretty far along with what we're doing there. The second thing that's true, though, is that as you look at the long run, I think there is a lot more runway to go in terms of what we can do with that poor technology, particularly when you consider the fact that, that technology is going to continue advancing. \r\nSo to be more specific, on larger models and next-gen AI capabilities moving from CPUs and GPUs, things like that, I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we really started into that nearly a year ago. These things were available prior to sort of a lot of -- the sort of big uptick in sort of the news cycle around earlier this year. These things were available and I worked close with them in past lives, knew the potential there, and it's something we really started to lean into nearly a year ago. \r\nWe started first on the organic side. And so as you look over the past several quarters, the fact that we've been able to take our recommender models up to be 100x larger than what they were. I mentioned on the call that 10 percentage point improvement in perceived relevancy by the user. In the world of search, advertising, discovery, 10 percentage point improvements in relevancy are like completely unheard of, like the magnitude of that like cannot be overstated. So I think that says, okay, we're seeing really tremendous impact from that, and we're well on our way on that on the organic side. \r\nOn the ad side, we just started bringing that over to the ad side now with models 100x larger. So we got right on the organic side first. Now we're bringing it to the ad side. And yes, same thing on the ad side, when you look at those things like a 5% reduction in CPA and a 10% lift in click-through rates, again, in the world of advertising, those are unheard of kind of numbers. And so we're early on there, but the impacts were profound. \r\nSo we're quite excited about how much more runway is left with those things. But we're deep enough in it to know that we feel like we are absolutely drafting on that acceleration and innovation that's happening in AI generally. It's been a core strength of Pinterest for a long time, computer vision as one of the places that has been sort of at the forefront of sort of advancements in AI and computer vision has been a strength for Pinterest, and we've got a really talented team there. So we feel really well positioned on continuing leverage from AI or further along on organic, but with a lot of runway to go. On the ad side, we're earlier there, but already seeing profound impacts. So again, tons of runway on both. \r\nI think on your second question, around the 10% of advertisers that had adopted measurement tools growing 30% -- on the range of 30%, we gave that update pretty deep into the quarter -- last quarter. So we're not updating those specific numbers at this moment. We're going to have our Investor Day coming up. We'll talk more about some of the progress there. The one thing I will say is that we've seen really nice continued adoption. The biggest thing I've been watching for is, as we continue along that adoption curve, do we continue to see the linkage between advertisers adopting the measurement tools and then seeing that they were getting much better performance than what they had realized from Pinterest and increasing spend. \r\nAnd that linkage, not only has that remained present as we've continued along that adoption curve. That linkage is becoming stronger. And maybe to give a little bit of a qualitative example of that when we were at Can, not that long ago, and great gathering of many of the world's leading advertisers, we had tremendous buzz there on a number of fronts just around the overall acceleration in our platform, our users and the acceleration of our ad platform. But this point of advertisers adopting and seeing that they were getting much more performance than what they had realized and there were much more performance oriented solutions available for them than what had been available for things like mobile deep link and things like that, that are driving great lower funnel performance. \r\nThere was really good buzz around that. And there's nothing better than having a large sophisticated advertiser out there saying, \"Oh, yes, we adopted that from Pinterest and saw really great results.\" And I think I mentioned that in my prior commentary that as we look at those that have adopted so far, or the early adopters, actually tended to be the larger, more sophisticated advertisers, the hardest ones to please. So I said before, if you can make them happy, you can make anybody happy. And that's what we've been seeing is that as successive cohorts are adopting, that linkage is not only still present, but getting stronger in terms of them seeing more performance than they realize and therefore, increasing their spend with us.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Rich Greenfield with LightShed Partners.\n\nRichard Scott Greenfield\n\nBill, you were talking about sort of the AI and targeting. And I guess there's just this growing fear among investors that everyone not named Meta, Google, Apple will be sort of little struggle to compete in AI as we look out over the next 2 years. And given the importance of AI, both as you were talking about from content recommendations and ad targeting, and I know sort of the history you spoke at Pinterest in terms of computer vision. But would love to get a sense of how you think about how you compete with the -- what is, I guess, the juggernaut in tech, especially given your background at Google? And then I just got a quick follow-up on demographics.\n\nWilliam J. Ready\n\nAll right. Maybe we get the follow-up quickly, just so we know what it is, and we don't lose it from you.\n\nRichard Scott Greenfield\n\nThe follow-up is just, you talked about the demographic group, you talked about Gen Z growing so quickly. As we look at all of the different demos that use Pinterest, especially as you think about shopping, the actual -- taking action on content and buying content. Do you see any major deviations or changes in terms of what behavior looks at by demographic as you look by cohort? Anything to kind of call out in terms of what you're seeing on shopping activity specifically?\n\nWilliam J. Ready\n\nOkay. Great. Thank you, Rich. So on your first question on AI, I think there's a question of do the benefits only accrue to the largest. I think we're already providing a pretty strong counterpoint to that. And actually, if you step back, I think if you look at like cloud computing, while, yes, cloud computing had a lot of benefits to the largest providers of cloud computing, it also created a lot of ability for a broad swath of people to engage. And I think you're seeing that with AI that -- yes, you have some of the largest players that are providing a lot of great capabilities there, but they're also externalizing those through cloud compute. It's also the case that the open source community is advancing really rapidly, and you're seeing some of these open source models are actually comparing quite favorably to some of the things that you would have seen come from the very largest players. \r\nAnd if I step back for a moment, I would actually take the view that I think in the sort of first round of next-gen AI, I think you've seen a lot of value accrue to the model creators. As you play that forward, I actually think there's going to be a lot of value that starts to accrue to the places that have really unique signal and really unique user interactions. The AI is only as good as the signal of home, which is acting. And when you look at it through that lens, we have a really unique signal at Pinterest. We've talked about this that unlike the rest of social media, we have very high commercial intent. But if you go further in that, it's not just we have commercial intent, it's not just that we know what people might click on or buy, these commercial journeys are long-lived, and users on Pinterest interestingly, are curating for the future. \r\nSo we don't just know what people have done in the past, we know what they're planning to do in the future. When you think of the power of that signal and what that can do in terms of the power of recommendations that we can make to users, the advertising capabilities that we can open up with that, I think we just have a lot of uniqueness in our signal from the fact that it's not just the people are shopping here, they are curating here. They are not just saying, okay, here's the pair of shoes I'm interested in, the handbag that I'm interested in or the dress that I'm interested in, they're saying, \"Here's how I think about putting a great outfit together.\" And this handbag and these shoes go with this dress, and that's being repeated across hundreds of millions of users on our platform. \r\nThat is a completely unique experience that doesn't exist anywhere else, certainly not in the Western world. And that really unique signal as we're pairing that with those models, I think that's letting us do really unique things with the way that we can make recommendations. So when I talk about that relevancy, a really interesting thing to think about for us is not even just that a search relevancy to you saying, \"Okay, you search for the sign we give you the right thing.\" We're doing that on things like related items. \r\nAnd so to get to things like 94% plus relevancy, when we're doing broader sort of discovery for the user, that is exceptionally difficult, but is an example of us taking the models that are becoming more generally available for all and then applying them to really unique signal and really unique user interactions on our platform. So I feel that we are quite well positioned in the longer term sort of move towards next-gen AI and the dynamics there, I think, are quite favorable for us. And again, I think no better way than to demonstrate that in your results, and we've been doing that.\r\nI think your second question on demographic groups. We've noted this multiple times that Gen Z is our fastest-growing demographic and our largest contributor to overall engagement, which means it's not just a high growth rate on a small denominator. It's our largest contributor to overall engagement growth. That's a really interesting thing I've worked on a lot of different consumer products and a lot of different platforms. Generally, as you get a more mature platform or more mature product, each successive cohort is a little less engaged, a little weaker. \r\nTo be able to say that we have Gen Z, a more recent cohort that's actually engaging even more deeply than our prior cohorts, I think is quite exceptional. And I think it gets to the fact that what we're solving with this ability to go from dreaming to doing and to use Pinterest as a way to play in your future, whether that's in travel or in shopping, I think that's really resonating in a lot of our next-gen experiences that we're bringing are resonating there as well, things like what we've done with Shuffles and the ability to go even more uniquely curate these things, that's working quite well. \r\nShopping, you asked about that specifically. I think we're finding that to be broadly resonant. And so not only is the shopping behavior broadly resonant across demographics, I mentioned that, that shopping behavior or sort of if you step back and say, doing more inspiration to action. We're seeing that work across other verticals and categories. That's quite encouraging for us as well like the travel example that I've spoken about.\n\nOperator\n\nThe last question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.\n\nDouglas Till Anmuth\n\nBill, I know you touched on API, I guess, I just want to understand what's keeping advertisers from adopting here? And what are you doing proactively to move them along the adoption curve? And then secondly, any comments on the MAU decline in Europe in 2Q? I don't know if that was part of the birthday collection dynamics that you've talked about. And just curious if you have any thoughts on overall 3Q MAU outlook?\n\nWilliam J. Ready\n\nThanks, Doug. I'll take your first one and then give Julia the second one. So our conversion API is important. Our conversion API, we've only recently put that out there. It's been on the market less than a year. So we're early on with that. So to say what's keeping folks from adopting it, we're really pleased with the progress that we've been making on that. It's a recent product for us, and we've seen really significant uptake of that product. So we feel really good about it overall. But of course, we wanted to be faster, given the magnitude of its impact is so consequential for us and the advertiser. I think the spirit of your question, like, hey, how do we move along the option curve faster. We very much are mindful of that. \r\nSo a few things that we're thinking about. The first is with that being a recently introduced product, we've really been getting our own go-to-market really tight in terms of how our sales team is engaging. The more we have proof points I talked about having large sophisticated advertisers that are speaking about how impactful it's been for them. That -- those reference points are really compelling, that's really helping us drive better and better go-to-market with our first-party efforts there. But the other thing that we're doing is working to meet the advertisers where they are because there's a broad-based adoption curve on these things, it's not just us with the larger platforms are putting these things out there as well. And so advertisers are moving through an adoption curve on this. So we're making sure that we're working with third-party partners. We've mentioned some of them like LiveRamp and Tealium or Google Tag Manager. \r\nAnd then certainly, our recent partnership with Amazon's ad platform, these are all examples of integrating to the platforms where those advertisers are already integrated. So that sort of multipronged approach of saying we're going to get better and better with our own go-to-market, which is working really well and advancing quite nicely as well as meeting the advertiser where they are. Those things are sort of the 2-point approach of how we're accelerating that. \r\nAnd again, the most encouraging thing is that consistently as those advertisers adopt these measurement solutions, they're seeing better performance than they expected from us and increasing their spend with us. So we think that is right now, the balance of those advertisers given us a new product being tilted towards not yet having that tool while that creates some headwind for us. We talked about that cohort being a mid-single-digit decliner. But the ones that have adopted those tending to be growers on the order of 30% that headwind flips around a tailwind as we get more of that balance of adoption. And we are seeing strong pull-through on that.\n\nJulia Brau Donnelly\n\nAnd then, Doug, just on your second question about monthly active user kind of trends, specifically in Europe and globally and now look for Q3. I'd say, as Bill noted, we feel really great about the monthly active user growth that we've seen globally. So we're at a 2-year high, both globally and in the U.S. and in rest of world and nearer to your high in Europe as well, if you look at year-over-year. Comps on MAUs, so I think we're feeling really good there. \r\nThere is some seasonality in the business on monthly active users as we called out on our prior earnings call. This is -- Q2 is a 30-day look back and during the month of June. And so you do typically see a little bit more seasonal weakness in Q2 and then that reverts back in Q3. So it's important to really focus on year-over-year metrics looking here. And on that basis, we're continuing to feel quite strong. Birthday collection was something we noted on the prior call, that ended up being a nonfactor and not material.\r\nSo overall feeling very good about all the trends that we're seeing on MAUs, the return on our marketing spend and all the user and growth engagements that we're investing in. And I would expect that we don't guide on MAUs for Q3 specifically, but in general, we feel really good about being able to maintain those year-over-year increases going forward.\n\nWilliam J. Ready\n\nAll right. Thanks again to all of you for joining the call and for your questions. We look forward to keeping the dialogue going, and hope you all enjoy the rest of your day.

If you want to skip background activity in the sector this year, then head on over to 5 Recent IPOs in 2023 to Consider.\n\nMost companies don't list their shares on the stock market. While big ticket names such as Apple, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Tesla get all the attention, the fact is that only 0.1% of companies in the U.S. have more than 500 employees. Yet, as any fan of the stock market would point out, the biggest companies are often the most valuable or have the most value. And, most of the biggest companies are often either state backed or publicly traded as back of the envelope estimates show that the top ten largest companies in the world in revenue terms are publicly traded.\n\nGoing public brings a multitude of benefits for both the firm and the investors that buy its shares. For the firm owners, if the initial public offering (IPO) is successfully executed and a strong business plan generates interest, then their shareholdings can significantly appreciate in value. As a simple example, consider the fact that Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Mr. Elon Musk became the company's majority shareholder in less than two years after it was incorporated by just pitching in $6.5 million in a Series A funding round. Now, Musk's current stake in America's largest electric vehicle manufacturer is worth a rather sizeable $190 billion. On a side note, Tesla has also limited the ability of shares that have been pledged for loans and can be collateralized to less than 25% of the stock unless less than $3.5 billion, interesting considering the fact that Musk has pledged almost 58% of his Tesla stock.\n\nSo, back to IPOs. Tesla went public in 2010 and since then the stock is up by more than 20,000% - which turns a dollar invested back then to more than $200. Not bad considering that only a few companies can beat or match this performance. For instance, the most expensive share on the stock market is Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A), whose gains on the market since stock started trading turn a dollar back then into more than $500 now, similar to the shares of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) but significantly less than Apple's.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile new firms tend to thrive in an open credit environment with low inflation and stable growth rates, the rapid shifts in the U.S. economy have not deterred a lot of firms from making the plunge and listing their shares for trading. Data shows that as of end July 2023, nearly 91 firms have gone public, and the group has shown modest performance on the market after listing. Out of these, only 53% are trading higher than their listing price. The percentage of firms demonstrating positive returns grows when only the second quarter of 2023 is considered. During the three months between April and June, 34 firms listed their shares for trading and 19 are in positive territory. July continues to extend this trend, as between May and July, an impressive 21 firms out of the 32 that have listed their stock have seen positive buying activity from investors.\n\nOne rockstar on the stock market that IPO'd earlier this year is the biotechnology firm Genelux Corporation (NASDAQ:GNLX). Genelux listed its shares in January, and the stock is up an impressive 286% year to date with the biggest share price gains taking place between February and mid-June. It develops treatments for ovarian cancer and has reported some positive data since listing the shares.\n\nA share price pop after an IPO doesn't have to last only a couple of days. After all, the biggest pops take place over the years, decades perhaps. Going long on the right stocks is quite rewarding, with one of the most successful investors of all time Warren Buffett smartly using this strategy. Our own research of some firms that started trading in pennies at the time of their public listing shows that a few have literally turned a dollar into a grand. Consider the story of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), one of the world's largest electronic commerce retailers. Amazon's shares IPO'd at $15, which translates into $0.075 after adjusting for four stock splits that split the shares 27 to 1. They currently trade at $128, which marks a stunning gain of 170,600%. In short, a dollar put in Amazon's stock in 1997 would be worth $1,706 today - a fact that has turned the firm's founder and former CEO Mr. Jeff Bezos into one of the richest men on Earth.\n\nSo, what are some IPOs that have taken place recently that rank high in terms of market capitalization? We took a brief look and narrowed down some firms. 10 Recent IPOs in 2023 to Consider\n\nPixabay/ Public Domain\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of IPOs to consider, we gathered firms that have listed their shares for public offering this year and ranked then by market capitalization. Out of these, the largest firms are selected and the list by all means is not exhaustive of all firms that have had an IPO in 2023.\n\n10 Recent IPOs in 2023 to Consider\n\n10. Kenvue Inc.

Out of the nine analysts that covered the stock in July, six had rated the shares as Hold. But, two Buy ratings and one Strong Buy rating tilt the average sentiment around the stock to Buy.\n\n9. Nextracker Inc. (NASDAQ:NXT)\n\nLatest Market Capitalization: $7.06 billion\n\nSince it's not a J&J subsidiary, Nextracker Inc. (NASDAQ:NXT) whose shares started trading in February has a lower market capitalization of $7.06 billion. Nextracker Inc.

The firm's IPO kicked off and lasted through the third week of June, and the stock is up an impressive 37% since then.\n\nCAVA Group, Inc. (NYSE:CAVA) is a consumer discretionary stock, which means that its fate is tied to the U.S. economy and discretionary income. It also has a Strong Buy rating on average; however, the average share price target of $45.86 is quite lower than the current share price of $51.64. J.P. Morgan had led the IPO and the firm aims to use the proceeds to further expand its already large national presence.\n\n7. ATS Corporation (NYSE:ATS)\n\nLatest Market Capitalization: $4.48 billion\n\nATS Corporation (NYSE:ATS) is a Canadian industrial equipment manufacturer that was set up in 1978. It is an engineering company that helps industrial users to set up their production lines and manage business functions such as supply chain management. Its IPO ended in May and the firm generated $282.9 million in gross proceeds.\n\nNot taking it slow after the IPO, ATS Corporation (NYSE:ATS) hopped on to the current interest in artificial intelligence and acquired a Belgian company that tailors AI tools for industrial use in July. Within weeks, this was followed by another acquisition that saw ATS Corporation (NYSE:ATS) bring in a life sciences technology company under its wing as well.\n\n6. Savers Value Village, Inc. (NYSE:SVV)\n\nLatest Market Capitalization: $4.02 billion\n\nSavers Value Village, Inc. (NYSE:SVV) is a retailer that refashions used fabrics for sale in Australia, Canada, and the United States.

It will indeed change the way businesses operate, and the companies that invest in AI now will have full advantage.\n\nAI news has been dominating the media for the past few months and will continue to be 2023\u2019s buzz word. In the same way the Internet changed our lives forever, AI could do the same.\n\nHaving witnessed the tremendous success of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), all investors are looking for AI stocks to buy. While every company isn\u2019t worth your money, some stocks are highly undervalued. Let\u2019s take a look at three cheap AI stocks to buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOracle (ORCL) ORCL stock: a 3-dimensional Oracle sign in an outdoor setting\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nOracle (NYSE:ORCL) was developed in 1977, and has been a leading enterprise database management system for over three decades. This first pick is currently an undervalued stock and has come to the limelight after the growing popularity of AI.\n\nIt is now becoming an AI leader with its years of experience and expertise to navigate a larger market. One reason to bet big on Oracle is its product. It\u2019s been known for the enterprise resource planning software system and enjoyed widespread popularity by companies across industries. It also offers cloud data center infrastructure which has seen a solid adoption rate. Its biggest client is Nvidia, a leader in the tech space. ORCL stock is trading at $117 today and is up 40% year to date. The stock has gone from $83 to $117 in 2023.\n\nIn the recent quarter, the company saw a 54% increase in cloud revenue and a 17% growth in total revenue. So although not all segments of the company are performing equally well, the demand for cloud is rising. In other words, we may see better revenue numbers going forward. The company is likely enjoying an advantage over its competitors due to its long-standing presence in the industry. It is using AI to thrive amid the competition and has recently introduced AI to its human resource software to increase productivity.\n\nStory continues\n\nOracle has an exceptional product and an A-list clientele. I believe the stock has plenty of upside from the current level. Its dividend yield of 1.38% is another reason to buy and hold one of the cheap AI stocks.\n\nPalantir (PLTR) Palantir Technologies (PLTR) logo seen on billboard, known as Palantir is a public American company that specializes in big data analytics.\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nDenver-based Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) originated in 2003 and has been steadily strengthening its position. No other company has been able to match its capabilities. It uses AI to make the systems smarter, investing in the platform that can process data from large language models. For a decade, the company has helped the government and other organizations manage and analyze data.\n\nA long-time belief has been held by investors that Palantir was highly dependent on government entities for contracts. But over time, the company managed to attract a large number of private organizations and expanded its client base. It also saw a whopping 41% rise year over year in customer base for the first quarter. Its revenue hit $525 million, forecasting solidly for Q2.\n\nPLTR stock is exchanging hands at $19.84 today and is up over 200% year to date. Looking at the company\u2019s potential, the stock looks undervalued. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives thinks that the stock is headed to $25 in the next year. The analyst believes that the tech firm will become one of the biggest firms in the AI space in this decade.\n\nPalantir already used AI for its services but is now harnessing its power to increase efficiency. It has the capability and a large customer base to be able to make the most of AI. The company is set to report results on August 7. PLTR is one of the affordable AI investments to make.\n\nIntel (INTC) Close up of Intel (INTC) sign at entrance of The Intel Museum in Silicon Valley. Intel is an American multinational corporation and technology company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nA well-established name in the industry, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is going all out to make a market impact with its AI technology.\n\nIt sells data center GPUs and is in the news for the Gaudi2 AI chip. This chip has become the center of the company\u2019s business, increasing traction within the industry. With a surge in demand, it\u2019s already shipping the chip to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services. While it may not be able to beat Nvidia\u2019s chips, Intel can cater to customers who do not want to wait for weeks to get Nvidia chips. It is one of the best cheap AI stocks to buy.\n\nThe company has already secured commitments from major industry players for the Gaudi2 chips. It plans to launch new products in the coming years which could drive the business further. It will launch Gaudi3 chips in 2024, and it can benefit from the rising demand for AI accelerators, too.\n\nOne reason to bet on the company is its diversified business. While the PC and CPU business is struggling, this downturn in demand has been balanced by the rise in demand for its AI chips. It also managed to report a profit in the second quarter after consistent losses. INTC stock is trading at $35 today and is inching closer to the 52-week high of $40. Considering the company\u2019s long-term potential, it still looks cheap to me.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Currently, global recorded music revenue is projected to grow at a rate of 7.5% in 2023, with a compound annual growth rate of 8.6% spanning from 2023 to 2030. This trend holds true for the United States as well, where streaming plays a crucial role in the overall music industry revenue, encompassing both physical and digital music sales. In fact, music streaming contributes a staggering 84% of the revenue in the U.S. music industry.\n\nGoldman Sachs Research suggests potential solutions to headwinds in the industry, such as pricing power, superfans monetization, and reevaluating the payment structure between streaming services and music labels. Lisa Yang, head of the European Media and Internet Research team, points out the current streaming practices and says,\n\n\u201cListening to a 31-second song by an independent artist, a full 3-minute song by a popular artist, and 5 minutes of the sound of rain are all treated equally.\u201d\n\nThe team's projections indicate that monetizing superfans could generate an additional $2 billion in revenue for streaming platforms by 2027 and a significant $4 billion by 2030, thereby contributing a notable 16% boost to paid streaming revenues.\n\nThe music industry has also experienced a significant increase in investment companies acquiring music rights, with millions of dollars paid for music catalogs. This surge is driven by the belief that music rights can serve as a valuable asset class, capable of generating long-term income through royalties and licensing deals. Universal Music Group, Sony Music Entertainment, and Warner Music Group Corp. (NASDAQ:WMG)'s dominance in the industry positions them as the primary buyers of music rights.\n\nStory continues\n\nJustin Bieber recently made headlines with his music rights sale, fetching over $200 million from Hipgnosis Songs Capital, marking the most substantial deal among artists of his generation. This sale encompasses Bieber's entire back catalog, consisting of 290 songs released before December 31, 2021. Investment companies see the purchase of music rights as a strategic move, anticipating long-term income through licensing deals and royalty payments, particularly for works from beloved artists.\n\nNumerous prominent musicians, such as Bruce Springsteen, Mariah Carey, Pink Floyd, Adele, Shakira, and Taylor Swift, have made significant deals by selling their music catalogs to investment companies. In November 2021, Bruce Springsteen sold his music rights to Sony Music for approximately $500 million, as reported by The Conversation.\n\nSimilarly, Adele sold half of her music publishing rights to Sony Music for an estimated $130 million in 2021, while Shakira sold her entire music catalog to Hipgnosis Songs Fund for around $300 million in the same year. As the music industry continues to evolve, it is likely that more musicians will follow this trend and sell their music catalogs to investment companies.\n\nGiven the multitude of music streaming services available, you might think about which music streaming service has the best audio quality.

On the other hand, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) Music offers the highest quality with High Definition. But Amazon.com, Inc.

The virtual clinics will address about 30 common concerns. In addition to video visits, patients in 34 states will also be able to use a messaging service. Yahoo Finance Health Care Reporter Anjalee Khemlani details the services the clinics will provide.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n- All right. Amazon expanding its virtual health clinic service nationwide. Amazon clinic initially launched last November as a virtual platform, connecting users with health care providers to treat common conditions. Yahoo Finance's, Anjalee Khemlani joins us now with all the details, Anj.\n\nANJALEE KHEMLANI: That's right Janna, I've the latest of the Amazon health care saga, if you will. One of their latest efforts to really gain market share when it comes to the provider side. So we know that Amazon has had many different iterations of this before, but now they're expanding what they launched in November nationwide to all 50 states. And it basically is like a telehealth service, but it also includes messaging visits for some states in 34 states specifically is where it's allowed.\n\nIt is a 24/7 opportunity, which really helps I think, with what you see out in the real world which is, restricted hours for physical locations. Even with telehealth in some instances, really restricted on what you can access. So this offers access to about 30 common types of issues, health issues, as well as the ability to get your prescription sent either via the Amazon pharmacy or to your local pharmacy.\n\nNow the key part of this, of course, is that they do not work with insurers just yet. So that's something that they're probably still working on. And it is available for a cash pay, so $35 for the messaging part of it, and then 75 for video. That 75 is a little bit on the higher side of what you see out in the market. We have seen others that are a little bit lower price point for video visits or messaging visits. So it'll be interesting to see how they compete in that space.\n\nStory continues\n\nI got a chance to speak to the general manager of Amazon Clinic just about what this opportunity means for Amazon, and how they really see their customer base and who they are. And in that interview, the general manager said that they've built a marketplace for third party providers or for provider groups whose goal has always been to follow the customer demand and the feedback. And what that really means from Dr. Ayogu is that they have essentially created what you know as Amazon, the marketplace, the e-commerce giant, but for providers now.\n\nSo that's how they're creating this situation where we have access to doctors in the same way you have access to whatever it is that you shop for on Amazon. So that's the latest, it's just the latest for Amazon large company. We know we covered their health scribe tool for providers, as well as the acquisition of One Medical and also the pharmacy. So this is just another step that we've seen this company take, and it could be probably the closest we see to disruption to the traditional health care space right now.\n\n- All right we will see what the uptake looks like here as Amazon once again continuing to really increase their footprint in the health care space.

So far, the Q2 cycle has been positive, helping reassure investors and boosting overall sentiment within the market.\n\nAnd this week, we have many notable companies slated to report, including Amazon AMZN and Apple AAPL. Both companies will report after the market\u2019s close on Thursday, August 3rd. Both stocks have staged big rebounds year-to-date, outperforming the general market handily.\n\nBut how do expectations stack up heading into their respective releases? Let\u2019s take a closer look.\n\nAmazon\n\nAnalysts have kept their earnings expectations muted for the quarter to be reported over the last several months, with the $0.34 per share estimate unchanged. The market heavyweight is expected to see a solid recovery, with the value reflecting a 240% improvement in earnings from the year-ago quarter. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAmazon\u2019s top line is also forecasted to see growth; the Zacks Consensus Sales Estimate for the release presently stands at $131.5 billion, 8.5% higher year-over-year. It\u2019s worth noting that the quarterly estimate is up a fractional 0.3% since the end of May.\n\nInvestors will wisely monitor Amazon Web Services (AWS) results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AWS net sales stands at $21.5 billion, indicating a 9% improvement from year-ago sales of $19.7 billion and reflecting a slight slowdown relative to prior year-over-year growth rates.\n\nThe company exceeded the consensus expectation for AWS net sales in its latest release, snapping a streak of back-to-back misses. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Amazon has posted sizable EPS beats in back-to-back releases, exceeding expectations by 47% and 40%. Below is a chart illustrating the share reaction to each of the company\u2019s previous three prints. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nApple\n\nApple\u2019s $1.19 per share estimate for the upcoming release is up a small 0.8% over the last 60 days, reflecting slight bullishness. The company\u2019s earnings are forecasted to retract a modest 1% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe tech titan is expected to post $81.3 billion in quarterly revenue, which reflects a modest 2% decline from year-ago sales of $83.0 billion. The quarterly estimate is down a fractional 0.1% since the end of May, reflecting neutrality among analysts.\n\nWhile iPhone revenue remains important, Apple\u2019s Services results (cloud services, App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay, and others) will also be closely monitored, as it\u2019s quickly become a new source of growth for the company.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Services revenue resides at $20.8 billion, 6% higher than the year-ago quarter. In its latest release, Services revenue of $20.9 billion reflected a quarterly record.\n\nAnd to top it off, our expectation for quarterly iPhone revenue stands at $40.1 billion, 1.4% lower than the year-ago quarter. The technology titan exceeded iPhone revenue expectations by 4% in its last quarter.\n\nApple posted results above estimates in its latest release, with shares reacting favorably post-earnings. Below is a chart illustrating the share reaction to each of the company\u2019s previous three prints. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nWith an extensive list of companies scheduled to unveil quarterly results this week, investors will have more than plenty to remain busy with. So far, earnings have been better than expected, helping us avoid the \u2018earnings apocalypse\u2019 many had feared.\n\nOn Thursday, after the market\u2019s close, we\u2019ll hear from heavyweights Apple AAPL and Amazon AMZN.\n\nAnalysts have primarily left their top and bottom line expectations unchanged for both companies over the last several months, with investors likely to focus on Amazon\u2019s AWS and Apple\u2019s Services results.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But, as soon as the Federal Reserve (Fed) began rate hikes, reality set in. Consequently, markets have thrown out the baby with the bathwater and there are several fintech stock bargains to buy.\n\nOver the past decade, fintech companies have brought innovations to consumer finance. For instance, peer-to-peer applications like Block\u2019s (NASDAQ:SQ) CashApp are leading the charge with convenient features like instant payments. As a result, consumers are adopting these technologies at a rapid pace.\n\nHowever, over the last year, the sector has had some challenges. Fintechs have been widely associated with cryptocurrencies and some support their usage. In 2022 this link heightened uncertainty primarily due to the various fraudulent schemes that emerged. As crypto exchanges such as FTX collapsed, fintech stocks suffered in tandem.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAt the same time, the Fed was raising rates leading to the banking turmoil in March. Also, since most buy now, pay later firms focus on near prime and subprime cohorts, their stocks sold off. Markets were selling, anticipating increased funding costs and credit deterioration.\n\nIn certain names, declines that started in 2022 have continued leading to discounted fintech stocks. However, given the positive economic surprises since May, these three fintech stock bargains are due for a catch-up trade.\n\nJack Henry & Associates (JKHY) bank stocks Hand inserting ATM card into bank machine to withdraw money\n\nSource: totojang1977 / Shutterstock.com\n\nJack Henry & Associates (NASDAQ:JKHY) is the second largest provider of banking software in the U.S. Its on-premises and cloud-based data processing system enables 950 banks and 720 credit unions to process transactions and more.\n\nThe Missouri-based financial technology company has underperformed the market and is down -4.8% year-to-date. Its exposure to banks and credit unions has been a headwind this year. However, now that the banking system has stabilized, it might be time to revisit one of the fintech stock bargains.\n\nStory continues\n\nResults have been resilient. In its third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the company delivered 8% non-GAAP revenue growth despite the disruptions in the banking sector. For the full FY2023, management issued guidance for $2.021 billion to $2.028 billion, an increase representing 4% growth.\n\nLooking ahead, management outlined the sizable market opportunity during its Investor Day in May. As banks increase investments in technology, Jack Henry will reap the benefits. They believe its next-generation banking platform will deliver the banking capabilities modern financial institutions need.\n\nAdditionally, as a value fintech stock investment, Jack Henry will reward patient investors. It is a disciplined capital allocator with a 20.1% return on invested capital and 34 fiscal years of consecutive dividend hikes.\n\nTipRanks analysts see some upside in the stock, with an average price target of $176. BTIG analyst Lance Jessurun initiated coverage in June with a \u201cbuy\u201d rating. He noted the stock\u2019s bargain valuation, stating, \u201cwe believe JKHY should outperform in a strained environment, especially with shares trading at a discount to historical averages.\u201d\n\nMarqeta (MQ) A laptop, pencil, pair of eyeglasses, and many coins rest on a wooden table.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSince its IPO in June 2021, Marqeta (NASDAQ:MQ) stock has been in a downward spiral. In contrast, fundamentals have been solid, with the company delivering sequential growth each quarter since its market debut. Due to this divergence, it\u2019s one of the best fintech stock bargains.\n\nMarqeta provides a modern card-issuing platform to companies. Its APIs offer a cloud-based payment infrastructure that enables customers to issue customized payment cards. Customers can build unique payment cards, manage card programs and authorize and settle transactions through the platform.\n\nPart of the reason why MQ has stagnated is because of its revenue concentration. Due to the nature of its platform, Marqeta relies on a few partners. As a result, it has ended up with a concentrated customer mix. For instance, in FY2022, it generated over 71% of revenues from Block.\n\nAs Marqeta continues to support innovation in the payment ecosystem, its revenues are growing rapidly. In FY2022, revenues grew 45%, highlighting the strength of its card issuing and transaction processing platform. It\u2019s gaining customers as businesses migrate from the inflexible legacy payment ecosystem.\n\nMarqeta remains one of the fintech stock bargains despite the impressive first quarter FY2023 results. Net revenues grew 37% YOY to $217 million. The company also highlighted its operating efficiency goals. \u201cIn the first quarter of 2023, we started to see our strategic focus on embedded finance and the implementation of new operating efficiencies pay off, laying a strong foundation for Marqeta\u2019s future.\u201d said Simon Khalaf the CEO.\n\nMarqeta\u2019s growth trajectory makes it one of the fintech stock bargains to buy. Invest alongside management who think the stock is undervalued and authorized a $200 million buyback last quarter.\n\nDLocal (DLO) An image of a laptop with financial icons coming off the screen; graph, mail, house, money; tech stocks\n\nSource: Sittipong Phokawattana/Shutterstock\n\nDLocal (NASDAQ:DLO) has been one of the fastest-growing fintech stock bargains over the past two years. In 2021 and 2022, revenues grew 134% and 72%, respectively. The company mainly operates in emerging markets like Latin America, Asia and Africa.\n\nDespite the growth, the stock has been a significant laggard this year, thanks to a Muddy Waters Research short report released in November 2022. Before the release, the stock was trading above $20 and hasn\u2019t recovered from the losses.\n\nAfter the short report, Bank of Americacame out in defense of the stock with a \u201cbuy\u201d rating. Particularly, analyst Jason Kupferberg rebuffed the overstated take rate allegations. \u201cGiven the sophistication of DLO\u2019s enterprise customers (such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google, we do not believe it is realistic that DLO is charging a huge premium vs. other providers.\u201d\n\nWhile the short report has been an overhang on the stock, the fundamental performance is strong. On May 18, the firm reported stellar Q1 FY2023 results. Revenues were $137.3 million, representing 57% YOY growth. Adjusted EBITDA was up 38% YOY to $45.5 million.\n\nManagement expects this earnings momentum to continue. CEO Sebastian Kanovich stated, \u201cWe are very excited about the massive opportunity ahead of us and we remain focused on executing our long-term strategy.\u201d\n\nLooking at the bigger picture, the stock is a bargain at a forward P/E of 20. More growth lies ahead as its technology platform redefines the online payment experience for emerging market merchants.\n\nOn the date of publication, Charles Munyi did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. We can see that Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) does use debt in its business. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?\n\nWhy Does Debt Bring Risk?\n\nDebt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. By replacing dilution, though, debt can be an extremely good tool for businesses that need capital to invest in growth at high rates of return. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Amazon.com\n\nWhat Is Amazon.com's Debt?\n\nThe image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that at March 2023 Amazon.com had debt of US$92.9b, up from US$68.1b in one year. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$64.4b, its net debt is less, at about US$28.4b. debt-equity-history-analysis\n\nHow Strong Is Amazon.com's Balance Sheet?\n\nAccording to the last reported balance sheet, Amazon.com had liabilities of US$147.6b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$162.3b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$64.4b as well as receivables valued at US$37.3b due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$208.2b.\n\nGiven Amazon.com has a humongous market capitalization of US$1.37t, it's hard to believe these liabilities pose much threat. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time.\n\nWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon.com has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.50. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 10.9 times over. So you could argue it is no more threatened by its debt than an elephant is by a mouse. In fact Amazon.com's saving grace is its low debt levels, because its EBIT has tanked 33% in the last twelve months. Falling earnings (if the trend continues) could eventually make even modest debt quite risky. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Amazon.com can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this freereport showing analyst profit forecasts.\n\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So the logical step is to look at the proportion of that EBIT that is matched by actual free cash flow. Considering the last three years, Amazon.com actually recorded a cash outflow, overall. Debt is far more risky for companies with unreliable free cash flow, so shareholders should be hoping that the past expenditure will produce free cash flow in the future.\n\nOur View\n\nBoth Amazon.com's EBIT growth rate and its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow were discouraging. But on the brighter side of life, its interest cover leaves us feeling more frolicsome. Taking the abovementioned factors together we do think Amazon.com's debt poses some risks to the business. So while that leverage does boost returns on equity, we wouldn't really want to see it increase from here. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. For example - Amazon.com has  2 warning signs  we think you should be aware of.\n\nWhen all is said and done, sometimes its easier to focus on companies that don't even need debt.

Customers also have access to advanced AWS technologies to accelerate innovation, including compute, storage, networking, business applications, developer tools, data analytics, security, machine learning, and artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nAWS released an economic impact study estimating the company\u2019s projected spend on the construction and operation of the new AWS Region, which will support an average of more than 7,700 full-time equivalent jobs at external businesses annually, with a planned $7.2 billion (approx. ILS 26.6 billion) investment in Israel through 2037. The construction and operation of the AWS Israel (Tel Aviv) Region is also estimated to add approximately $13.9 billion (ILS 51.7 billion) to Israel\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) through 2037.\n\nCustomers and AWS Partners welcome the AWS Israel (Tel Aviv) Region\n\nIsraeli organizations are among the millions of active customers using AWS in more than 190 countries around the world. Large and small enterprises in Israel choose AWS to innovate, drive cost efficiencies, and accelerate time to market.

The new AWS Region will make it easier for us to offer innovative solutions to our customers while continuing to accelerate our digital transformation and meet the strictest regulatory requirements.\"\n\nThe Consumer Protection and Fair Trade Authority is an independent government agency that is responsible for ensuring legal compliance and consumer rights. The Authority established a new national \"Do Not Call\" database that is aimed at curbing the problem of unwanted marketing calls in Israel. \"The \u2018Do Not Call\u2019 database project was a technical challenge that required us to develop a service that was secure, accessible, and simple to use for all users,\" said Peleg Shafir, chief technology officer at the Consumer Protection and Fair Trade Authority. \"AWS helped us create a scalable solution that meets the needs of every citizen, regardless of their language or digital literacy. With the opening of the AWS Region in Israel, we will have even more possibilities to provide our users with the fastest access to our services and an exceptional digital experience.\"\n\nThe Ministry of Transport and Road Safety is responsible for the planning, development, and regulation of infrastructure and integrated transport systems in Israel. \"Public Transportation has moved to AWS to increase efficiencies in the collection, management, research, and processing of public transportation data in Israel,\" said Ortal Niv, chief information officer at the Ministry of Transportation and Road Safety. \"We use AI services to accelerate information processing, provide accurate prediction of transportation needs, improve traffic management capabilities, and help reduce traffic jams.

The program now operates in more than 25 schools across the country, mainly in disadvantaged and rural communities.\n\nTo help grow the next generation of Israeli enterprises, AWS began supporting startups in Israel in 2013 through its AWS Activate program. This program gives startups access to guidance and one-on-one time with AWS experts, as well as web-based training, self-paced labs, customer support, third-party offers, dedicated events, and up to $100,000 in AWS service credits\u2014all at no charge.\n\nCommitment to sustainability\n\nAmazon is committed to becoming a more sustainable business and reaching net-zero carbon across its operations by 2040, 10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement, as part of The Climate Pledge. Amazon co-founded The Climate Pledge and became its first signatory in 2019.

See Amazon's public methodology for more on its approach. In 2022, Amazon set a new corporate record for the most renewable energy announced by a single company in one year and remains the largest corporate buyer of renewable energy\u2014a position it\u2019s held since 2020, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Amazon now has 401 renewable energy projects in 22 countries. Additionally, AWS will be water positive by 2030, returning more water to communities than it uses in its direct operations.\n\nAbout Amazon Web Services\n\nSince 2006, Amazon Web Services has been the world\u2019s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud.

Meanwhile, Facebook-owner Meta Platforms is reportedly gearing up to launch a new artificial intelligence chatbot that can take on the personas of different characters. Elsewhere, a bright pulsating sign on the roof of the headquarters of Elon Musk's newly-renamed social media group X is taken down after sparking controversy with local residents.\n\n1. Futures inch lower\n\nU.S. stock futures edged under the flatline on Tuesday as a new month of trading begins with a stream of corporate earnings set to be released.\n\nBy 05:16 ET (09:16 GMT), the Dow futures contract slipped by 97 points or 0.27%, S&P futures lost 12 points or 0.25%, and Nasdaq 100 futures dipped by 48 points or 0.30%.\n\nThe main indices closed out July in the green, with the benchmark S&P 500 jumping by 3.1% during the month after the close of dealmaking on Monday. It was the index's fifth straight month of gains - the longest such streak since 2021. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also climbed by more than 3% in July, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite added around 4.1%.\n\nEmerging signs of cooling inflation, resilient economic activity, and expectations that the Federal Reserve may soon back away from an aggressive campaign of interest rate hikes have combined to help underpin a wide-spread rally in stocks. The second-quarter earnings season, meanwhile, has featured stronger-than-expected results from a host of major companies.\n\n2. Busy earnings week kicks into gear\n\nA rush of corporate returns is due out on Tuesday, accelerating the pace of a busy week that will see more than 160 S&P constituent firms report their latest quarterly earnings.\n\nHeadlining Tuesday's releases before the start of U.S. trading are pharmaceutical companies Merck (NYSE:MRK) and Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), as well as construction equipment giant - and economic bellwether - Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT). Chipmaker AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and coffee chain Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) will also unveil results after the bell.\n\nStory continues\n\nLater in the week, tech giants Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) are scheduled to deliver their latest earnings.\n\nMore than half of the companies in the S&P 500 index have already reported. According to FactSet data cited by CNBC, four-fifths of these businesses have posted earnings that topped Wall Street estimates.\n\n3. Meta preparing to launch AI chatbots - FT\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is preparing to release new artificial intelligence-powered chatbots that have different personalities, according to a report in the Financial Times, as the Facebook parent attempts to boost user engagement.\n\nCiting people familiar with the matter, the paper said Meta is working on prototypes that can carry on humanlike conversations. Some versions of the AI, known internally as \"personas,\" can take on various characters, the FT added. Sources also told the paper that Meta is exploring one chatbot that speaks like Abraham Lincoln or another that gives travel advice in the style of a surfer.\n\nThe chatbots, which the FT said could be launched as soon as September, are being designed to create a new search function and offer recommendations.\n\nMeta declined to comment to the FT.\n\nThe report comes as the Menlo Park, California-based tech giant has been facing fierce competition to attract users and keep them engaged with its platforms. Like other Silicon Valley players, Meta is also in a race to develop -- and ultimately profit from -- AI technology.\n\n4. Controversial X sign dismantled\n\nA large glowing X on the roof of the San Francisco headquarters of X - the short-text messaging company formerly known as Twitter - has been removed following a string of complaints from neighbors.\n\nThe flashing sign had been placed on top of the firm's Market Street high-rise offices last Friday. Over the weekend, 24 complaints about the X were filed with the city's building department, Reuters reported. Locals had been taking videos showing the pulsating light, criticizing it as an intrusive presence in the area.\n\nA spokesperson from San Francisco's Department of Building Inspection told Reuters that inspectors had observed the structure being dismantled on Monday, adding that the property owners will be fined for the \"unpermitted installation of the illuminated structure.\u201d\n\nX, meanwhile, claimed the sign was taken down voluntarily.\n\nThe controversy comes as X's owner Elon Musk is attempting to overhaul the social media group and turn it into a so-called \"everything app\" that includes everything from payments to ride hailing. Musk has also said he would keep X in San Francisco despite what he described as a \"doom spiral\" of businesses leaving the city.\n\n5. Oil drifts lower\n\nOil prices slipped on Tuesday in a sign of potential profit-taking following a July rally that was supported by tightening global supplies and hopes for a rebound in demand in the second half of the year.\n\nBy 05:17 ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.37% lower at $81.50 per barrel, while the Brent contract dropped 0.29% to $85.18 a barrel.\n\nAnalysts cited by Reuters argued that oil prices may be correcting after being overbought in recent months. Meanwhile, sentiment was dented by a private survey that suggested further weakness in the Chinese economy, the world's biggest crude importer.\n\nHowever, both U.S. crude and Brent settled at their highest levels since April on Monday, boosted in part by the prospect of output cuts by Saudi Arabia and Russia this month. Riyadh is also reportedly expected to extend its reductions into September at a meeting this Friday of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies.\n\nMeanwhile, investors are becoming more confident that the Federal Reserve may be able to bring down inflation without causing a wider collapse of the U.S. economy. According to analysts, such a scenario, which has been dubbed a \"soft landing,\" could help bolster fuel demand later this year in the U.S., the world's biggest oil consumer.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nBusy earnings day, Meta reportedly prepares AI chatbot - what's moving markets\n\nFactbox-China's measures to slow yuan depreciation\n\nExclusive-China asks some banks to reduce or delay dollar buying -sources", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/busy-earnings-day-meta-reportedly-052320050.html", "symbols": ["AAPL.US", "AMD.US", "AMZN.US", "CAT.US", "DJI.INDX", "FB2A.F", "FB2A.XETRA", "IXIC.INDX", "META.US", "MRK.US", "PFE.US", "SBUX.US"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.944, "neg": 0.045, "neu": 0.89, "pos": 0.065}}, {"date": "2023-08-01T00:00:14+00:00", "title": "Amazon Wants to Double Its Same-Day Delivery Facilities", "content": "Maybe Amazon will one day figure out how to get your stuff to you before you even order it, but until then you'll have to settle for same-day...", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/m/aaecd840-05b9-34ef-9d64-6f8d25bed757/amazon-wants-to-double-its.html", "symbols": ["AMZ.F", "AMZ.XETRA", "AMZN.MX", "AMZN.US", "AMZO34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.09, "neg": 0, "neu": 0.952, "pos": 0.048}}]
