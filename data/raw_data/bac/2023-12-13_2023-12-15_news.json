The move was backed by solid volume with far more shares changing hands than in a normal session. This compares to the stock's 8.2% gain over the past four weeks.\n\nShares of Bank of America rallied for the second consecutive day. The Federal Reserve signaled end of the current rate cycle and kept the interest rates unchanged at 22-year high of 5.25-5.5% at the end of two-day FOMC meeting. The central bank also indicated three interest rate cuts by 2024-end.\n\nThese developments turned investor sentiments bullish on bank stocks as high funding costs being faced by the industry players will somewhat come down next year. This will support net interest income and margin growth. Hence, the BAC stock moved higher.\n\nThis nation's second-largest bank is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.71 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -16.5%. Revenues are expected to be $24.11 billion, down 1.7% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWhile earnings and revenue growth expectations are important in evaluating the potential strength in a stock, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor Bank of America, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.9% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. And a negative trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't usually translate into price appreciation. So, make sure to keep an eye on BAC going forward to see if this recent jump can turn into more strength down the road.\n\nThe stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

One particular clutch of five stocks did particularly well after an analyst upgraded them as a group. Two of the more prominent titles in the quintet were Bank of America(NYSE: BAC) and PNC Financial Services(NYSE: PNC), which rose by nearly 6% and almost 5%, respectively.\n\nThat's one mega upgrade\n\nThe prognosticator behind the lifts was Odeon Capital's Dick Bove, who published his new take on the five banks before market open. He lifted his recommendation on all to buy from the previous hold. In addition to Bank of America and PNC, the quintet included other familiar lenders Wells Fargo, U.S. Bancorp, and Truist Financial.\n\nBove's series of upgrades were based on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's comments in the wake of the Fed's interest-rate decision, which was handed down on Wednesday. The analyst said those comments were a \"clear\" indication that inflation has ended.\n\nThe Fed elected to hold its key interest rate steady that day. It also indicated a willingness to start reducing rates next year.\n\nLower rates bring increased demand for loans, especially for the big guys\n\nLower rates are a double-edged sword for banks. On one hand, they reduce the cost of loans, thereby raising demand for such products. On the other, all things being equal, the profit they earn from those cheaper borrowings is lower. Bank sector bulls likely believe that high-volume lenders like Bank of America and PNC, with its large regional footprint, will benefit from that theoretical increased demand for loans.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Bank of America right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Bank of America, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Bank of America wasn't one of them.

On November 30, 2023, Buffett's firm reduced its stake in the technology company by a significant 47.37%, selling 46,351,068 shares. On the transaction date, HPQ's shares averaged $29.34 per share. This move has altered the landscape of Buffett's investment portfolio, where HP Inc now represents a 0.48% position, down from the previous 0.91%.\n\nThe Investment Strategy of Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio)\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 9 Warning Signs with PAHC.\n\nWarren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio)'s investment philosophy has long been a beacon for value investors worldwide. As the chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett has transformed a modest textile company into a colossal conglomerate, primarily focusing on insurance and other diverse investments. His strategy, deeply influenced by Benjamin Graham, emphasizes understanding a business, investing with a margin of safety, and choosing companies with favorable long-term prospects and competent management. Buffett's top holdings reflect this approach, with major stakes in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), American Express Co (NYSE:AXP), and Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), among others. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Trims Stake in HP Inc\n\nDetails of Buffett's HP Inc Trade Action\n\nThe transaction on November 30 marked a reduction in Buffett's position in HP Inc, with the shares now accounting for 5.20% of the company's outstanding stock. The trade had a moderate impact on Buffett's portfolio, decreasing its weight by 0.43%. Despite the reduction, HP Inc remains a notable holding within the portfolio, showcasing Buffett's continued, albeit reduced, confidence in the company's value proposition.\n\nImpact on Buffett's Portfolio\n\nFollowing the sale, HP Inc stands as a smaller, yet still significant, component of Buffett's investment holdings. The current 0.48% portfolio position indicates a strategic shift, possibly suggesting a reallocation of capital towards other opportunities or a response to changing market conditions. Nevertheless, HP Inc continues to be a part of Buffett's diverse and carefully selected investment mosaic.\n\nStory continues\n\nHP Inc at a Glance\n\nHP Inc, a leading player in the PC and printing industries, has been a household name since its inception. With a global customer base and a focus on the commercial market, HP Inc has strategically positioned itself since separating from Hewlett Packard Enterprise in 2015. The company's reliance on channel partners and outsourced manufacturing has allowed it to maintain a strong presence in its market segments, including Corporate Investments, Personal Systems, and Printing.\n\nFinancial Health of HP Inc\n\nAs of the latest data, HP Inc boasts a market capitalization of $30.57 billion, with a stock price of $30.93. The company is fairly valued according to the GF Value, with a GF Value of $31.56 and a price to GF Value ratio of 0.98. HP Inc's financial strength is evident in its PE Ratio of 9.40, indicating profitability, and a GF Score of 88/100, suggesting a high potential for outperformance. The company's balance sheet, profitability, and growth ranks are commendable, further solidifying its financial stability. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Trims Stake in HP Inc\n\nOther Notable Investors in HP Inc\n\nBuffett is not the only guru with a vested interest in HP Inc. Other prominent investors include Dodge & Cox, Joel Greenblatt (Trades, Portfolio), and Jefferies Group (Trades, Portfolio), each maintaining their own positions in the company. Buffett's holdings, however, remain significant in comparison, reflecting his unique investment strategy and market influence.\n\nMarket Reaction and Prospects for HP Inc\n\nSince the trade date, HP Inc's stock has experienced a 5.42% increase, indicating a positive market reaction. The company's year-to-date performance also shows a 15.63% increase, suggesting a strong trajectory. With a solid GF Score and a stable financial outlook, HP Inc appears well-positioned for future growth, aligning with the market's optimistic view of its potential.\n\nTransaction Analysis and Influence\n\nWarren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio)'s decision to reduce his stake in HP Inc has undoubtedly caught the attention of the investment community. While the trade has slightly decreased the prominence of HP Inc within Buffett's portfolio, it remains a noteworthy holding, reflecting a calculated adjustment rather than a complete withdrawal. This move may signal Buffett's nuanced approach to portfolio management, balancing long-term value with the agility to adapt to market dynamics.\n\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

He\u2019s one of the great \u201cbuy-and-hold\u201d investors of all time. The man excels at identifying undervalued, high-quality stocks that are poised to climb over the long term. The Oracle of Omaha, as Buffett is sometimes called, also frequently invests in equities that both pay significant dividends and enable investors to benefit from their price gains. As a result, he gets paid to wait for these stocks to rally. However, Buffett certainly isn\u2019t always right. He was wrong to sell airline stocks towards the beginning of the pandemic and his oil stocks are taking a pounding lately. Having said that, I still believe that there are many, great, undervalued Warren Buffett stocks from which to choose. Here are three such names for longer-term investors to consider.\n\nNu Holdings (NU) Online banking businessman using smartphone with credit card Fintech and Blockchain concept\n\nSource: Joyseulay / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter, Buffett owned 107 million shares of Nu Holdings (NYSE:NU), a Latin American fintech company.\n\nNu is growing rapidly while generating huge profits. Last quarter, it added a net total of 5.4 million new customers, and it became Brazil\u2019s \u201d\u00a0fourth-largest financial institution by number of customers,\u201d according to the firm. Its average revenue per customer jumped 18% versus the same period a year earlier, while its overall top line, excluding foreign currency fluctuations, soared 53% year-over-year to $2.1 billion. Finally, its net income, excluding some items, jumped to $355.6 million from $63.1 million in Q3 of 2022.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAt least two billionaires besides Buffett owned NU stock as of the end of Q3, with both Daniel Sundheim and Lee Ainslie buying sizeable amounts of the shares.\n\nGiven the company\u2019s very rapid growth, its 25.4 forward price-earnings ratio makes it one of the most undervalued. Warren Buffett stocks.\n\nBank of America (BAC) Street view on Bank of America branch in NYC with people waiting, pedestrians crossing, crosswalk, bike, road in Manhattan\n\nSource: Andriy Blokhin / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs of the end of Q3, Buffett owned 1.03 billion shares of Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) stock. The Oracle is one of the relatively few large investors who are fond of BAC, as many mutual funds are under weight the shares while a multitude of hedge funds are shorting it, Goldman Sachs reported earlier this month.\n\nStory continues\n\nNonetheless, after the Federal Reserve on Dec. 13 indicated that it was poised to cut interest rates three times next year, I expect BAC to have a great 2024. That\u2019s because the bank\u2019s shares have been in the dog house on Wall Street due to the fact that much of its balance sheet consists of bonds whose value has been pummeled as a result of interest rate increases.\n\nBut now, with the Fed turning quite dovish, rates are sinking, causing bonds\u2019 value to surge. Furthermore, the latter phenomenon, in turn, should do wonders for BAC\u2019s popularity on Wall Street.\n\nIndeed, in the month that ended on Dec. 14, BAC climbed 8.5%.\n\nNevertheless, the shares, which have a significant dividend yield of 3%, still have an extremely low price-earnings ratio of nine.\n\nHP (HPQ) HP sign with blue sky and autumn leaves as backdrop\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nBuffett has cut his holdings in HP (NYSE:HPQ) stock by almost 60% in recent months. The multi-billionaire, however, still has a 5% stake in the firm that\u2019s now worth $1.6 billion.\n\nAnd for income investors and conservative investors, I view HPQ stock as a good pick at this point.\n\nResearch firm Canalysis predicting that PC sales will climb by 5% in Q4 and 8% in 2024,. That phenomenon would certainly improve HP\u2019s financial performance. What\u2019s more, the AI revolution is widely expected to cause PC sales to surge, as PCs with localized AI capabilities become popular.\n\nDespite these significant, positive drivers, HPQ stock, which has a meaningful dividend yield of 3.65%, has a very low forward price-earnings ratio of 8.65 times.

More interest rate cuts than previously expected are on the horizon.

And now, Stovall says, the market \"has further to run.\"\n\nThe moves have brought the major averages near record highs.

For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article5Penny Stocks that Captured the Attention of Billionaires.\n\nInvestors are jubilant after the Fed\u2019s clear signal that it would begin cutting interest rates in 2024. Markets have remained under pressure due to uncertainty caused by higher interest rates. While many believe we are still not out of the woods, the Fed\u2019s acknowledgement that its efforts against inflation are working and its readiness to take a dovish stance is enough to soothe investors\u2019 nerves in the short term.\n\nBut will stocks keep rebounding in 2024? Will socks rise after the Fed actually starts to cut interest rates? An interesting report from LPL Research takes a look at the behavior of equities during interest rate cuts. The report said that while assessing or predicting stock movements driven by interest rate cuts, it\u2019s extremely important to pay attention to where we actually are in the business cycle. For example, the report said that when the Fed began to cut rates after series of hikes in January 2001 and September 2007, the economy entered recessions. However, rate cuts of 1984, 1987, 1989, 1995, and 1998 saw the S&P 500 significantly rise over the next six to 12 months.\n\nA report by Meeder Investment Management takes an interesting look at the effect of rate cuts on stocks and whether it makes sense to be overly bullish on stocks on expectations of rate cuts next year.\n\n\"One common perception among investors is that the stock market will perform well once the Fed starts cutting interest rates. History tells us this is not necessarily always the case. In fact, over the past nine initial interest rate cuts, more than half of the Fed\u2019s first cuts were followed by declines in the S&P 500 Index ranging from -22.6% to -55.5%. The Technology bubble in the early 2000s and the Great Financial Crisis proved to be the worst scenarios, with the Fed cutting interest rates at two different times during the secular bear market of 2000\u20132009. On the other hand, four of the nine occurrences were followed by minimal weakness and achieved strong 6-month returns. On balance, over the past nine initial interest rate cuts, the S&P 500 Index had an average decline of -20.5% and an average 6-month return of 3.4%. So while the market has experienced both bull markets and bear markets following the first rate cut, history does not indicate that the Fed\u2019s accommodative policy will simply carry the market higher. Valuations matter too. When the market had a decline of at least -20% after the Fed\u2019s first cut, the average S&P 500 trailing PE ratio was 18. On the other hand, when the S&P 500 had a decline of less than -10%, the average PE ratio was 11.4. The current P/E ratio of 22 could be another reason to be more cautious once the Fed makes its first cut.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nRisky stocks were ruthlessly shunned by investors when the inflation storm forced the Fed to take a hawkish stance. The market was more gravitated towards safe stocks like Coca-Cola Co (NYSE:KO), Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) and Kroger Co (NYSE:KR). But as investors begin to look towards the era of rate cuts and monetary ease, small companies might see a rebound in investor interest in the coming weeks and months. In this environment, it makes sense to see which penny stocks are bought by smart money investors.

Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. also returned to the top three as Chinese state-backed brokerage Citic Securities Co. ceded its number one ranking, though it retained its leading position in global IPO underwriting.\n\nDespite equity capital markets around the world being dogged by interest rate hikes, two wars and debate over a potential recession, roughly $516 billion was raised across IPOs, secondaries and the red-hot convertible bond market, data compiled by Bloomberg show.

Citic Securities fell in this year\u2019s league table to the sixth spot, while previously fifth-ranked China International Capital Corp. dropped to eighth.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead More: Chinese Banks Drop Out of Top Five Global Equity Underwriters\n\nThe restrictions resulted in active IPO applications to plunge to 353 on Nov. 13 from close to 800 just two months earlier, opening the door for international firms like JPMorgan and others to take global underwriting market share from Chinese brokers, said Sharnie Wong, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence in Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cChina could see its IPO pipeline squeezed further amid regulatory caution on vetting new listings in order to bolster secondary-market activity,\u201d according to Wong.\n\nGoldman Sachs was an underwriter on several of the year\u2019s biggest equities deals. In addition to helping lead IPOs for Arm Holdings Plc and Kenvue Inc., it helped offload billions in secondary sales including those for Japan Post Bank Co Ltd. and AerCap Holdings NV.\n\nOverall, equity linked products like convertible bonds saw issuance top $108 billion in 2023, a roughly 20% rise versus the previous year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Bank of America led the global equity-linked league table and is credited with more than a 10% table share, working on deals from household names like PG&E Corp., Uber Technologies Inc., and Duke Energy Corp.\n\nEven as global equity markets rallied, just $25.4 billion was raised in US IPOs this year, a modest bump from last year\u2019s tepid volume but a 92% plunge from 2021\u2019s boom, data compiled by Bloomberg show. JPMorgan played a role in the five largest US IPOs, making it the highest ranking player in the global IPO league table among non-Chinese firms.\n\nIn Europe, the Middle East and Africa, first-time share sale volumes are set to end the year at their lowest level since 2012, data compiled by Bloomberg show, despite a burgeoning Middle Eastern IPO market.

When all was said and done on Wednesday, SoFi Technologies(NASDAQ: SOFI) was up 12.5%, Bank of America(NYSE: BAC) had risen 4.2%, and Fifth Third Bancorp(NASDAQ: FITB) closed up 6% for the session. Several other major bank stocks followed suit with more conservative pops amid a broader market rally; both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indexes jumped more than 1.3% on Wednesday.\n\nIn the U.S. Federal Reserve's final meeting of 2023, Fed officials opted to leave the central bank's benchmark interest rate flat at a targeted range of between 5.25% and 5.5%. This was the third straight monthly decision in which rates were left unchanged -- albeit following an unprecedented cycle of 11 rate hikes since the Fed began raising rates in March 2022.\n\nWhat's more, policymakers on the Federal Open Market Committee signaled on Wednesday there will be at least three rate cuts in 2024, likely in quarter-percentage-point increments.\n\nWhy lower rates are a mixed bag for bank stocks\n\nSo why, then, are bank stocks rallying in response? After all, higher interest rates are widely viewed as a positive catalyst for banks. The country's leading banks can generally increase profits by taking advantage of greater spreads between the interest paid to customers and the money they can make by investing those customers' funds.\n\nAt the same time, with the fed funds rate now hovering at its highest level in over 22 years, the Federal Reserve's decision to increase interest rates at an unprecedented pace was aimed at easing runaway inflation, which has dampened consumer spending, borrowing activity, and broader economic growth. While banks can undoubtedly leverage higher rates to some extent, investors are right to celebrate the prospect of spurring greater economic activity as the rate-hike cycle begins to reverse course.\n\nStory continues\n\nNot every bank will win as rates come down\n\nWednesday's broader market rally undoubtedly helped fuel gains for several beaten-down bank stocks. But make no mistake: Not all banks are created equal. That could be a big reason SoFi Technologies, in particular, is enjoying outsize gains right now.\n\nIndeed, I singled out SoFi back in July given its cutting-edge technological foundations and notable lack of physical branches. SoFi is a vertically integrated, digital-first fintech stock that not only obtained a national bank charter in early 2022, but also recently launched banking-as-a-service platform Cyberbank Digital in late 2022.\n\nGiven its digital-first, mobile-centric approach, SoFi has been able to attract hundreds of thousands of new customers and multiple billions of dollars in new deposits for each of the past several quarters; SoFi added 717,000 new members last quarter alone, bringing its total to over 6.9 million, while deposits at SoFi Bank grew by $2.9 billion, up 23% sequentially between the second and third quarters to $15.7 billion. This swelling deposit base provides SoFi with a lower-cost funding source for its fast-growing loan business, while simultaneously allowing it to maximize net interest margin by holding loans on the balance sheet longer than it could before receiving its bank charter.\n\nMeanwhile, Bank of America's deposit base remained relatively flat sequentially last quarter, albeit at a much larger base of roughly $1.88 trillion. Fifth Third Bank's deposits rose a modest 2% sequentially in Q3, to $165.6 billion.\n\nBut SoFi's true strength could become even more evident as the Fed begins to reduce rates in 2024. During an earnings conference call earlier this year, SoFi CEO Anthony Noto asserted that as rates inevitably begin to decline, his company should \"be able to hold rates much longer and higher than our competitors and really gain even more market share.\"\n\nThe Federal Reserve's latest move to hold rates steady while signaling multiple rate reductions in 2024 is undoubtedly a net positive for bank stocks right now. But rather than spreading my investments across multiple banks' shares, I'm personally content concentrating my capital on up-and-coming bank stocks like SoFi that are poised to enjoy relative outperformance as the Fed's new rate cycle takes hold.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in SoFi Technologies right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in SoFi Technologies, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and SoFi Technologies wasn't one of them.

With the lithium price pullback being a temporary event, investors should take full advantage of the weakness here and with other beaten-down lithium stocks.

In his 58 years at the helm, he's overseen a greater than 4,300,000% aggregate gain in Berkshire's Class A shares (BRK.A), as well as doubled up the annualized total return, including dividends, of the widely followed S&P 500.\n\nLengthy books have been written on the core philosophies the Oracle of Omaha lives by, which includes thinking long-term and buying into great businesses with sustained catalysts at a fair price. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nBut what doesn't receive nearly enough credit for Buffett's nearly six decades of investment success is his penchant for buying dividend stocks. Companies that pay a regular dividend to their shareholders are usually profitable and time-tested. What's more, income stocks have a history of running circles around public companies that don't offer a payout in the return department.\n\nA majority of the stocks currently held by Berkshire Hathaway pay a dividend, with Buffett's company set to collect close to $6 billion in income over the coming 12 months.\n\nBut what's truly surprising is how much of this income will derive from a small number of holdings. Warren Buffett and his team are set to rake in nearly $3.5 billion in annual dividend income from just four stocks over the next year.\n\nBank of America: $991,537,926 in annual dividend income\n\nBerkshire Hathaway's No. 2 holding by market value, Bank of America(NYSE: BAC), will be doing the heaviest lifting of all when it comes to providing dividend income. The more than 1.03 billion shares Buffett's company owns of BofA will translate into almost $992 million in dividend income over the next 12 months.\n\nThe lure of bank stocks for Buffett has always been their cyclical ties and the recurring need for financial services. Though banks are cyclical, and will therefore contend with higher delinquency rates and loan losses during recessions, periods of economic expansion last considerably longer than downturns. Rather than foolishly trying to time when these downturns will occur, Buffett has wisely positioned Berkshire Hathaway in high-quality financial stocks, like BofA, to take advantage of long-winded expansions.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut there's more to Berkshire's No. 2 holding than just macroeconomic factors. Bank of America is also the most interest rate-sensitive of America's largest banks by assets. When interest rates change, no bank is more impacted than BofA.\n\nSince March 2022, the nation's central bank has increased the federal funds rate by 525 basis points, which is the fastest pace of rate hikes in more than four decades. Every rate hike is leading to billions of dollars in added net interest income each quarter.\n\nAs I've previously pointed out, BofA has done an admirable job of digitizing its platform. Online and mobile-based transactions are considerably cheaper than in-person interactions. As more of its customers utilize digital transactions, Bank of America will be able to consolidate some of its physical branches and lower its expenses.\n\nApple: $878,937,967 in annual dividend income\n\nPerhaps it comes as no surprise that tech stockApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) plays a key role in Berkshire Hathaway's dividend income collection. Apple accounted for 49% of the company's nearly $366 billion of invested assets as of the closing bell on Dec. 8, 2023, making it the biggest holding by a considerable amount in Buffett's portfolio.\n\nThe $15 billion Apple is doling out in dividends annually is a reflection of its top-notch branding, as well as its cutting-edge innovation.\n\nAccording to Kantar's 2023 BrandZ Rankings, Apple is the world's most valuable brand. It has an exceptionally loyal customer base, along with phenomenal pricing power. Meanwhile, Interbrand has listed Apple as the world's \"best brand\" for 11 consecutive years.\n\nBeyond brand value, Apple is riding high thanks to its innovation. It's been a leading provider of smartphones for more than a decade, and it's led the way with tablets via the iPad. Moreover, CEO Tim Cook is overseeing the steady transition of Apple into a platforms-focused company. A subscription-driven model will further enhance customer loyalty and meaningfully improve the company's operating margin over the long term.\n\nI'd be remiss if I didn't also mention Apple's unsurpassed capital-return program. In addition to its massive nominal-dollar dividend, Apple has repurchased in excess of $600 billion worth of its common stock since the start of 2013. Buffett has always appreciated a rock-solid share-buyback program.

Every single share of common stock has been purchased since the start of 2022.\n\nBuffett's company also holds $8.49 billion of preferred stock in Occidental yielding 8% that'll generate around $679.2 million in annual income. Berkshire originally held $10 billion in preferred stock tied to a 2019 deal that helped Occidental acquire Anadarko. However, Occidental has redeemed $1.51 billion of this preferred position, through Nov. 7.\n\nWhat makes Occidental such an attractive investment to Buffett and his team is the expectation that the spot price of crude oil will remain above its historic average. Supporting this thesis is Russia's war with Ukraine, along with three years of capital underinvestment by energy companies caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. As long as crude oil supply remains tight, there's a good likelihood that the spot price of crude oil will stay elevated.\n\nA higher spot price for crude oil is especially important for Occidental Petroleum. Although it's an integrated energy company, it generates the lion's share of its revenue from its drilling operations. This is to say that if the spot price of crude oil increases, Occidental's operating cash flow will benefit more than most other integrated oil and gas operators. Just keep in mind that the reciprocal would also be true -- a declining spot price for crude oil will disproportionately hurt Occidental's operating cash flow.\n\nCoca-Cola: $736,000,000 in annual dividend income\n\nThe fourth stock that, collectively with Bank of America, Apple, and Occidental Petroleum, allows Buffett to rake in nearly $3.5 billion in annual dividend income is beverage stock Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO). Coca-Cola has raised its base annual payout for 61 consecutive years, and it's Berkshire's longest continuous holding (since 1988).\n\nOne reason Coke is such a phenomenal income producer is that it's a consumer staples stock. Regardless of how well or poorly the U.S. and global economy perform, consumers are going to need food and beverages. This creates a predictable demand floor for Coca-Cola each year.\n\nBranding is another catalyst for Coca-Cola and its rock-solid payout. Coca-Cola has topped the annually released \"Brand Footprint\" report from Kantar as the most chosen brand for 10 years running, as of 2022. Coke has a well-recognized logo and its top-notch marketing efforts have helped it connect with young and mature audiences alike for decades.\n\nEqually important, Coca-Cola brings virtually unmatched geographic diversity to the table. With the exception of North Korea, Cuba, and Russia (the latter of which is due to its aforementioned ongoing war with Ukraine), Coke is operating in every other country around the globe. It has 26 brands generating at least $1 billion in annual sales, and it's able to rely on emerging markets for a proverbial shot in the arm of organic growth.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway's cost basis for its Coca-Cola shares is just $3.2475. Based on its $1.84-per-share annual payout, Buffett's company is netting almost a 57% yield on cost. Put another way, Coca-Cola's dividend income alone is more than doubling Berkshire's initial investment in the company every two years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Bank of America right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Bank of America, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Bank of America wasn't one of them.
