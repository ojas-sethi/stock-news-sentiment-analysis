[{"date": "2024-04-16T16:47:42+00:00", "title": "Big banks led by Citi continue to trim staff to cut costs", "content": "By Niket Nishant and Manya Saini\n\n(Reuters) - U.S. banking giants continued to shed employees in the first quarter, with Citigroup seeing the biggest drop.\n\nHeadcount at Citi declined by 2,000 employees after the third-largest U.S. lender completed a sweeping reorganization aimed at improving profits and reducing management layers.\n\nBank of America, Wells Fargo and PNC Financial together cut more than 2,000 jobs in the three months ended March 31 compared with the previous quarter.\n\nBanks are under pressure to control costs due to the uncertain economic outlook. While investors are still expecting the Federal Reserve to tame inflation while avoiding a major economic slowdown, expectations remain in a flux about the potential for interest-rate cuts later this year.\n\nCiti's reductions were part of a total 7,000 job cuts that will be reported in upcoming quarterly earnings as employees complete their notice periods, its Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason told reporters on Friday.\n\nThe layoffs were part of a broader goal to reduce Citi's staffing by 20,000 over the next two years.\n\nIndustry executives acknowledged the challenges in navigating the changing rate environment. Analysts said higher funding costs, contracting net interest margins and uneven trading results were likely to keep banks cautious.\n\n\"We managed headcount,\" Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan told analysts on Tuesday. \"We noted the expectation in January of last year that our headcount will be down throughout the year.\"\n\nBofA's headcount has fallen by more than 4,700 from the first quarter of 2023.\n\nAcross Wall Street, investment banks brought in higher revenue, fueled by a revival in capital markets. Executives have become more optimistic that a surge in equity offerings will lift sentiment and spur mergers and acquisitions.\n\nThat would bolster the outlook for Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, where headcount shrank by 900 and 396, respectively. Morgan Stanley's finance chief Sharon Yeshaya told analysts on Tuesday the investment bank was still making \"opportunistic hires.\"\n\nIn 2023, rival Goldman Sachs undertook its biggest round of layoffs since the global financial crisis of 2008.\n\nJPMorgan Chase, however, went against the trend. The largest U.S. bank continued to bolster its ranks, adding nearly 2,000 employees in the first quarter to a total of 311,921.\n\n(Reporting by Manya Saini and Niket Nishant in Bengaluru; Editing by Lananh Nguyen and Arun Koyyur)\n\nView comments", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-banks-led-citi-continue-164742612.html", "symbols": ["BAC-PB.US", "BAC-PE.US", "BAC-PK.US", "BAC-PL.US", "BAC.MX", "BAC.US", "BML-PG.US", "BML-PH.US", "BML-PJ.US", "BML-PL.US", "BOAC34.SA", "BOFA.NEO", "C.MX", "C.US", "CITI.NEO", "CTGP34.SA", "MSC.US", "NCB.BE", "NCB.F", "NCB.HM"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": -0.674, "neg": 0.061, "neu": 0.896, "pos": 0.043}}, {"date": "2024-04-16T16:12:00+00:00", "title": "Bank of America Earnings Drop, Under Pressure From Higher Rates; Stock Falls", "content": "Bank of America reported a 18% drop in first-quarter profit, the latest big lender to feel the squeeze of higher interest rates.

That was more than the $1.26 billion analysts had estimated. An increase in charge-offs on credit cards is largely a hangover from the previous quarter and is flattening out, Chief Financial Officer Alastair Borthwick said.\n\nShares of Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America slumped as much as 5% to $34.15 Tuesday morning, their biggest drop in intraday trading in more than a year. They\u2019re up 2.2% this year.\n\nBank of America\u2019s non-interest expenses climbed 6.2% from a year earlier to $17.2 billion, driven by a $700 million special assessment from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. tied to last year\u2019s regional-bank failures. Charges and costs have been a focal point for investors, with persistent inflation putting pressure on spending. Analysts had expected a 2.6% increase to $16.7 billion. Without the FDIC charge, expenses would have totaled $16.5 billion, or up 2%.\n\nStill, the company\u2019s traders notched one of their best first quarters on record as the company also reaped the benefits of elevated borrowing costs that pushed net interest income above analysts\u2019 estimates.\n\nRevenue from equities trading jumped 15% to $1.87 billion in the first three months of the year as clients grappled with a period of continued high interest rates and geopolitical tensions. That helped Bank of America top analysts\u2019 net-income estimates, with the bank making $6.67 billion in the quarter.\n\n\u201cBank of America\u2019s sales and trading businesses continued their strong 2023 momentum this quarter, reporting the best first quarter in over a decade,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan said in the statement.\n\nThe second-largest US bank said that net interest income, a key source of revenue for the bank, fell 2.9% to $14 billion in the first quarter of this year. Analysts had expected a 4% drop for NII, the revenue collected from loan payments minus what depositors are paid.\n\nLast week, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co. both reported NII that missed analysts\u2019 estimates, with executives pointing to increased funding costs.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead More: Bull Case Fizzles for Big US Banks to Earn Ever-More on Lending\n\nIn the second quarter, Bank of America\u2019s NII is likely to approach $14 billion, which is expected to be the \u201clow point\u201d for the year, with growth coming in the second half of 2024, Borthwick said on a call with analysts. If rates remain high, that will benefit future NII results, he said.\n\nBank of America\u2019s results offer another look at how US consumers and businesses are faring as the Federal Reserve leaves borrowing costs higher for longer. Lenders\u2019 balance sheets overall have remained resilient amid elevated interest rates, though uncertainties remain, including inflationary pressures and attacks in the Middle East.\n\nIn a sign of companies returning to capital markets and dealmaking, investment-banking fees rose 35% to $1.6 billion in the first quarter, driven by strength in equity and debt underwriting.\n\n\u201cInvestment banking saw a nice rebound in this quarter,\u201d Moynihan said on the analyst call. \u201cOur results reflect the benefits of investments made in our middle-market investment-banking teams and dual-coverage teams.\u201d\n\nRevenue in Bank of America\u2019s wealth business also climbed, gaining 5.2% to $5.59 billion. It was a record quarter for the division, driven by \u201chigher asset-management flows,\u201d Borthwick said on a conference call with reporters.\n\nThe company\u2019s loan balances rose to $1.05 trillion at the end of the first quarter, up 0.3% from a year earlier and less than analysts\u2019 estimates of $1.06 trillion. Lending \u2014 a key focus for investors, with high interest rates making borrowing costlier \u2014 has remained \u201csluggish,\u201d Borthwick said on the media call.\n\nDeposits, another closely watched measure since the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank a year ago made the flight of funds more common, have remained stable at Bank of America. Total deposits rose to $1.95 trillion in the first quarter, up 1.2% from the previous three months.\n\n--With assistance from Keith Gerstein.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nA Resilient Global Economy Masks Growing Debt and Inequality Top Takeaways From Businessweek\u2019s Investigation of Teenage Sextortion Cities Use AI to Help Ambulances and Firetrucks Arrive Faster The Shadow Swiftie Economy Booms With Bootleg Bracelets and $1,150 Bodysuits How a Pioneering Blackjack Master Beats the Odds of Aging\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bofa-shares-drop-charge-offs-143949377.html", "symbols": ["BAC-PB.US", "BAC-PE.US", "BAC-PK.US", "BAC-PL.US", "BAC.MX", "BAC.US", "BML-PG.US", "BML-PH.US", "BML-PJ.US", "BML-PL.US", "BOAC34.SA", "BOFA.NEO", "MSC.US", "NCB.BE", "NCB.F", "NCB.HM", "NCB.STU", "NCB.XETRA", "NCB0.F"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.992, "neg": 0.047, "neu": 0.852, "pos": 0.101}}, {"date": "2024-04-16T14:26:00+00:00", "title": "Housing Numbers Shrink as Q1 Earnings Heat Up: BAC, JNJ, UNH", "content": "Tuesday, April 16th, 2024\r\n\r\nNew housing data has hit the tape this morning.

A cooling housing market is part of what the Fed needs to see before pulling the trigger on lowering interest rate levels.\n\nBy the same token, lowering rates in the near term may constitute a heating up in housing, which would increase inflation.

The bottom line compared unfavorably with the 94 cents earned in the prior-year quarter.\r\n\r\nAfter considering the FDIC special assessment charge of $700 million, earnings per share was 76 cents.\r\n\r\nDespite modest loan growth (loan balances rose 0.3% from the prior-year period) and high interest rates, BofA recorded a decline in net interest income (NII) because of higher deposit costs.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, BofA witnessed a 1.9% increase in total deposit balances at the end of the quarter.\r\n\r\nAlso, total IB fees (in the Global Banking division) of $850 million increased 27.2% year over year, driven primarily by growth in underwriting income (up more than 50% year over year). Advisory services revenues witnessed a decent increase in the quarter.\r\n\r\nSimilar to the second, third and fourth quarters of 2023, BofA recorded an improvement in trading numbers in first-quarter 2024. Sales and trading revenues (excluding net DVA) were up 2.5% from the prior-year quarter to $5.18 billion. Fixed-income trading fees declined 3.6%, while equity trading income jumped 15.1%.\r\n\r\nOverall, the company\u2019s net income applicable to common shareholders plunged 19.8% from the prior-year quarter to $6.14 billion. Our estimate for the same was $6.15 billion and did not take into account non-recurring items reported in the quarter.\n\nRevenues Decline, Expenses Rise\n\nNet revenues were $25.82 billion, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $25.28 billion. However, the top line declined 1.7% from the prior-year quarter.\r\n\r\nNII (fully taxable-equivalent basis) fell 2.7% year over year to $14.19 billion. Our estimate for NII was $14.09 billion.\r\n\r\nNet interest yield contracted 21 basis points (bps) to 1.99%.\r\n\r\nNon-interest income decreased marginally from the prior-year quarter to $11.79 billion. The decline was mainly due to a fall in fees from market-making and similar activities. We had projected non-interest income of $11.22 billion.\r\n\r\nNon-interest expenses were $17.24 billion, up 6.2% year over year. Our estimate for non-interest expenses was $16.40 billion.\r\n\r\nThe efficiency ratio was 66.77%, up from 61.84% in the year-ago quarter. An increase in the efficiency ratio indicates a deterioration in profitability.\n\nCredit Quality Worsens\n\nProvision for credit losses was $1.32 billion, up 41.7% from the prior-year quarter.\r\n\r\nNet charge-offs jumped 86% year over year to $1.50 billion. As of Mar 31, 2024, non-performing loans and leases as a percentage of total loans were 0.56%, up 18 bps year over year.\n\nStory continues\n\nCapital Position Strong\n\nBook value per share as of Mar 31, 2024, was $33.71 compared with $31.58 a year ago. Tangible book value per share as of the first-quarter end was $24.79, up from $22.78.\r\n\r\nAt the end of March 2023, the common equity tier 1 capital ratio (advanced approach) was 13.4%, up from 12.9% as of Mar 31, 2023.\n\nCapital Distribution Update\n\nIn the reported quarter, the company returned $4.4 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases.\n\nOur Take\n\nBofA\u2019s focus on digitizing and expanding operations, decent loan growth, and high interest rates are likely to keep aiding growth. However, elevated expenses, rising funding costs and near-term macroeconomic factors pose major headwinds.\n\nBank of America Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Bank of America Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nBank of America Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Bank of America Corporation Quote\n\nCurrently, BAC carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The adjusted figure excludes the impacts of expenses from the FDIC special assessment. In the prior-year quarter, the company reported earnings per share of $1.23.\r\n\r\nWFC\u2019s results benefited from higher non-interest income. An improvement in capital ratios and a decline in provisions were other positives. However, a decrease in NII and loan balances and an increase in expenses were the undermining factors for WFC.\r\n\r\nCitigroup Inc.\u2019s C first-quarter 2024 net income from continuing operations per share of $1.58 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.13. However, the metric declined 28% from the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nHowever, C witnessed declines in total loans and deposits in the quarter. Also, a dip in revenues and deteriorating credit quality were worrisome.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

But the results beat analysts' estimates.\n\nThe Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank posted a profit of $6.67 billion, or 76 cents per share, compared with $8.2 billion, or 94 cents a share, in the same period a year earlier. BofA had to make a one-time $700 million payment to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to help the agency replenish the deposit insurance fund.\n\nExcluding that one-time charge, the bank earned 83 cents per share.\n\nBank of America has been dealing with the effects of higher interest rates on its loan and investment portfolio for the past year. The bank bought a sizable number of bonds during the pandemic when rates were low, and those bonds have lost value as interest rates have risen.\n\nThe bank is also paying more on deposits, which has caused its profits to be squeezed slightly. The bank's net interest yield, which is a measure of how much the bank is earning on the loans it has versus the interest it needs to pay out to depositors, dropped from 2.20% in 2023 to 1.99% in 2024.\n\nIn BofA's consumer banking division, its largest by revenue and profits, revenue fell by 5% to $10.2 billion. While the bank said it saw consumers open more accounts and spend more on their credit and debit cards, the bank had to set aside more funds to cover potential loans and charged off credit cards.\n\nInvestment banking revenues were mostly flat, but the bank saw modest growth in investment banking fees and trading revenues in the quarter.\n\nView comments", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bank-americas-1q-profits-fall-124523123.html", "symbols": ["BAC-PB.US", "BAC-PE.US", "BAC-PK.US", "BAC-PL.US", "BAC.MX", "BAC.US", "BML-PG.US", "BML-PH.US", "BML-PJ.US", "BML-PL.US", "BOAC34.SA", "BOFA.NEO", "MSC.US", "NCB.BE", "NCB.F", "NCB.HM", "NCB.STU", "NCB.XETRA", "NCB0.F"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.967, "neg": 0.02, "neu": 0.865, "pos": 0.116}}, {"date": "2024-04-16T11:22:00+00:00", "title": "Bank of America Reports First-Quarter 2024 Financial Results", "content": "CHARLOTTE, N.C., April 16, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Bank of America reported its first-quarter 2024 financial results today.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis on retiring to Canada, you may go to 5 Worst Places to Retire in Canada.\n\nRetirement Realities: Surprises, Worries, and Canadian Dreams\n\nAccording to NBC News, 2023 was expected to be hit with a recession. Instead, it surprised everyone when it curbed inflation instead, and even delivered economic growth that was \u201cbetter than expected\u201d. Of course, the investors are happy. However, they aren\u2019t the only group of people that are. Retirement account holders are another group of people that have been gaining from favorable markets, as noted by the results revealed by a Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) survey. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)'s Retirement and Personal Wealth Solutions, along with its Bank of America Institute, have revealed their fourth quarter 2023 Participant Pulse. The report indicates that average 401(k) account balances rose 15% to $86,280 in 2023, up from $75,045 at the end of 2022. While participants have been contributing more to their plans, the value of investments has also increased, thereby increasing balances.\n\n\u201cWe were encouraged to see more plan participants taking positive actions in their accounts in the fourth quarter. These insights offer signs that people are prioritizing their retirement savings, with more employees increasing their contribution rates and fewer taking hardship distributions\u201d.\n\n- Lorna Sabbia, Head of Retirement and Personal Wealth Solutions at Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC).\n\nWhile average account balances may be up, they are nowhere near what the average retiree needs saved for a comfortable retirement here in the US. According to a survey from The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), Americans believe they need at least $1.8 million to retire comfortably. Meanwhile, the 2022 Survey of Consumer Finances reveals that the average retirement savings for all families is a mere $333,940. For reasons like these, F&G Annuities & Life, Inc. (NYSE:FG) notes that 50% of pre-retirees and retirement Americans are considering delaying, or even coming out of, retirement.\n\nFinancial worries are the top reason Americans are thinking of doing so, notes F&G Annuities & Life, Inc. (NYSE:FG). Those nearing retirement believe they don't have enough saved. Yet many others are worried about how inflation is going to shake things up in the future, and there's also the dreaded depletion of the Social Security trust fund, expected to happen in the year 2033.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Amid inflation, changing workforce dynamics post-COVID, and overall generational shifts, Americans are rethinking retirement and extending their time working or, for some retirees, unretiring altogether\u201d.\n\n-Chris Blunt, President & CEO of F&G Annuities & Life, Inc. (NYSE:FG).\n\nEven though Americans may not have enough to retire comfortably here in the US or any other dream destination, that doesn't mean they don't have the heart to. One such destination for many retirees is Canada. According to a study by Bank of Montreal (NYSE: BMO) Financial Group, Canadians think they need $1.7 million to retire, up from $1.4 million in 2020. The numbers aren't much different from what Americans believe they need for retirement in the US, which is why retiring to this part of the world isn't quite impossible.\n\nNevertheless, both Americans and Canadians have similar hopes and fears when it comes to retirement savings. The Retirement Study by Bank of Montreal (NYSE: BMO) reveals how Canadians are concerned about inflation and rising prices, and also how it\u2019s going to impact their financial situation and their retirement goals.\n\n\"While the anticipated headwinds in 2023 will understandably prompt concerns about how inflation and interest rates will affect our finances, Canadians remain resilient and are taking proactive measures to protect and invest in their retirement nest egg\u201d.\n\n-Nicole Ow, Head, Retail Investments, Bank of Montreal (NYSE: BMO).\n\nFinancials aside, many prospective retirees often wonder if it is worth retiring in Canada. The answer is a resounding yes. Thanks to its universal healthcare, good quality of life, and diverse culture, retirees are probably going to enjoy their time in the country. However, one thing they need to make sure is that they consider relocating to some of the best places to retire in Canada. Some of these best places include Victoria and Vancouver in British Columbia, Quebec City in Quebec, and even Calgary in Alberta.\n\nWith that said, let\u2019s check out all the worst places to retire in Canada to steer clear of: 20 Worst Places to Retire in Canada\n\nCopyright: blaze986 / 123RF Stock Photo\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile the list of worst places to retire in Canada, we used several sources and expat forums such as Money Sense, Daily Hive, and Savvy New Canadians, amongst others. A consensus approach was used to select the worst places, with one point awarded to a place each time it was recommended by a source. Scores were summed up and places were ranked according to our \"Insider Monkey Score\" in ascending order from the lowest to the highest scores.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a similar consensus approach, we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). Whether you are a beginner investor or a professional one looking for the best stocks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\nHere are the worst places to retire in Canada:\n\n20. Sarnia, Ontario\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 3\n\nHome to many industrial complexes, Sarnia lands on our list of worst places to retire in Canada because of its poor air quality. Global News shared a news report last year that revealed how living in certain parts of Sarnia is bad because it poses an increased risk of cancer, particularly leukemia, due to exposure to air pollution.\n\n19. Thompson, Manitoba\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 4\n\nThompson may be a diverse place to live, but it\u2019s also one of the most dangerous ones. This city in north-central Manitoba, Canada lands up as a worst retirement destination because of its violence.\n\n18. Winnipeg, Manitoba\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 5\n\nNext up on our list of worst places to retire in Canada is Winnipeg. If you ask the residents, they\u2019d say it is because of the poor healthcare. A poll conducted by Angus Reid Institute reveals how 77% of Manitobans state that the healthcare in the province is poor. Staffing shortages and longer wait times are two reasons for the bad state of affairs.\n\n17. Thunder Bay, Ontario\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 6\n\nOne of the worst cities to retire in Ontario is Thunder Bay. Reporting an estimated 775.2 offenses per 100,000, the city is a bad choice, especially for seniors. Other reasons for avoiding Thunder Bay are its harsh weather and difficult job market, which means seniors may have a hard time finding work if they choose to.\n\n16. Prince Rupert, British Columbia\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 7\n\nSimilar to many other British Columbia communities, Prince Rupert isn\u2019t ready to house a large senior population. It\u2019s not the cleanest place on our list, there isn\u2019t much to do here. Many residents are also thinking about leaving the community amidst growing health concerns, reports Nelson Star.\n\n15. Regina, Saskatchewan\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 8\n\nIf this was a list of places to retire on a fixed income, Regina would have made it to our list of the most affordable places to retire for seniors. However, the reason Regina makes it to our list of worst places is its weather.\n\n14. North Battleford, Saskatchewan\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 9\n\nRetirees may be attracted to North Battleford because of its affordability, but residents say it\u2019s bad because of its crime problem. People there call it Crime City, which means seniors are better off relocating elsewhere.\n\n13. Lethbridge, Alberta\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 9\n\nLethbridge lands up on our list because the locals say there isn\u2019t much to do here. Also, the wind tends to get pretty bad, so it\u2019s less likely that you\u2019re going to enjoy the outdoors. Lethbridge is also infamous for its crime.\n\n12. Hamilton, Ontario\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 10\n\nHamilton in Ontario faces a problem with air pollution, making it a bad place to live for seniors. According to CBC, breathing the air in parts of Hamilton is like smoking a cigarette a day.\n\n11. Moncton, New Brunswick\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 11\n\nMoncton is another place that has landed on our list of worst places to retire in Canada because of its notoriety for crime. The CCI reports 1,085.3 offences per 100,000 people.\n\n10. Saskatoon, Saskatchewan\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 13\n\nSimilar to Moncton, Saskatoon also has a bad reputation and is deemed a dangerous place for retirement.\n\n9. Kelowna, British Columbia\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 14\n\nWhile not an entirely bad place to live, Kelowna lands on our list of worst places to retire in Canada because it\u2019s becoming unaffordable for seniors. Property values and living costs are on the rise here, which means seniors on fixed incomes should steer clear of such areas. According to Houseful, the median price of a home in Kelowna is $854,230. The crime is pretty bad, too.\n\n8. Abbotsford-Mission, British Columbia\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 15\n\nNext our list of worst places to retire in Canada is Abbotsford-Mission, BC. According to the CCI, this district has recorded 818.4 offenses per 100,000 people.\n\n7. Timmins, Ontario\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 16\n\nBoasting much to do, one might be wondering why Timmins is one of the worst places to retire in Canada. The major reason for Timmins's bad reputation is because it is one of the most dangerous places one can choose to retire to.\n\n6. Campbell River, British Columbia\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 17\n\nDowntown, the homelessness situation has been getting worse than ever.

While he refuses to allow Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A)(NYSE:BRK-B) to pay any to shareholders, he enjoys collecting those checks from the businesses he owns.\n\nBuffett believes he can deliver superior returns for his shareholders if he allows them to make decisions for themselves. He\u2019s probably right. Since becoming chairman of Berkshire Hathaway in 1964, he has generated overall returns of 4,384,748% by the end of 2023. In contrast, the S&P 500 achieved over 31,000% returns. That means Buffett\u2019s compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19.8% beat the benchmark index by nearly two-to-one. Most investors will have a tough time doing that in one year. Buffett\u2019s done it for 60 years!\n\nThe Oracle of Omaha collected around $6 billion in dividends last year. That\u2019s without doing anything but holding onto the shares of companies he already owns. But that\u2019s only from his publicly traded stocks. In Buffett\u2019s 2020 Berkshire Hathaway shareholder letter, he revealed that his wholly owned railroad, BNSF, paid him $41.8 billion in dividends since it was acquired in 2010.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSo, which are Buffett\u2019s best dividend stocks? Based on the amount collected, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) will generate nearly $1 billion in dividends this year. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) will deliver another $860 million. Yet I\u2019m looking for the top stocks, so I wanted dividends that yielded at least twice the average yield of the S&P 500\u2019s 1.4% yield. BAC stock just missed the cut at 2.7%, while AAPL pays a miserly 0.5%.\n\nThe following three Warren Buffett dividend stocks yield over 3% each and, in return, will mail Oracle $2.1 billion in checks this year.\n\nKraft Heinz (KHC) A magnifying glass zooms in on the Kraft Heinz (KHC) website.\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nPackaged food stock Kraft Heinz (NYSE:KHC) is the seventh largest holding in Berkshire Hathaway. Buffett owns 325.6 million shares worth $11.8 billion. With a yield of 4.4%, it is the highest-yielding stock in the portfolio, which is set to deliver $520.5 million in dividends.\n\nThat\u2019s not too shabby for a stock Buffett to consider a mistake. His holdings are the result of Buffett helping private equity firm 3G Capital Management to take control of H.J. Heinz in 2013 and then helping engineer the ketchup maker\u2019s acquisition of Kraft Foods two years later. While Buffett believes the Heinz deal was good, he feels he \u201coverpaid\u201d for Kraft.\n\nSince acquiring Heinz, Buffett\u2019s total return on the stock has been less than 18% compared to a 344% return by the S&P 500. The company owns a portfolio of top name brands like Kraft and Heinz and Jell-O, Kool-Aid and Maxwell House coffee. Half a million dollars a year in dividends can soften the blow of paltry returns and Buffett says he will never sell KHC stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nCoca-Cola (KO) ko stock coca cola life\n\nSource: Coca-Cola\n\nIt\u2019s likely no surprise Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) is on the list since it\u2019s been known for years as a cash-producing machine. Buffett famously bought the beverage giant\u2019s stock after Coca-Cola sent him a can of Cherry Coke in the 1980s. He ended up selling out of his Pepsico (NASDAQ:PEP) holdings and today owns 400 million shares of Coke worth $23.5 billion. That\u2019s a 9.3% share of the company, accounting for over 6% of Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nKO stock yields 3.3%, so Buffett will receive dividend checks this year amounting to $775.6 million from the soda king. Of course, Coca-Cola is much more than just a soda jerk today; it has a broad swath of the beverage market, including water, tea, juices and energy drinks.\n\nAlthough Buffett doesn\u2019t really buy and sell the company\u2019s shares anymore, preferring to just hold for the long term, Coke tends to be an all-weather stock. Cans of soda and other beverages are indulgences consumers will enjoy regardless of economic conditions. This is why it continues to thrive, and Buffett will likely never sell his holdings.\n\nChevron (CVX) Here's Why Investors Should be Bullish on Chevron Stock at Current Levels\n\nSource: Roman Tiraspolsky / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe brightest dividend star in Berkshire Hathaway has to be oil and gas giant Chevron (NYSE:CVX). Buffett owns over 126 million shares valued at $20.5 billion. That puts the oil stock fifth in the portfolio.\n\nBuffett was selling shares of the energy company last year as he scooped up more shares of Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) because of its position in the Permian basin. But in last year\u2019s fourth quarter, he became a buyer again. Chevron is also a giant in the oil-rich Permian and its pending acquisition of Hess (NYSE:HES) will give it access to the lucrative Guyana market (that is, if Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) doesn\u2019t muck it up).\n\nWith CVX stock yielding 4% a year, Buffett stands to receive $822 million in dividends this year. This will be an income stream that goes on for years and years as fossil fuel demand continues to grow.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a LONG position in KO, XOM and CVX stock.

After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings \u2014 with the most up-to-date information possible \u2014 is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for BAC in this report.\n\nIn fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently higher than the broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 77 cents per share.

These help to cut through the noise surrounding a stock. And, in some cases, the opinion of analysts is one of those indicators. Analyst-backed stocks have a high correlation with future stock price growth.\n\nAnalysts have access to information, and corporate insiders, that individual investors like you and me do not. They also generally follow many stocks within a sector, giving them the ability to spot emerging bullish or bearish trends. When analysts upgrade a stock or maintain a rating of Buy (or one of its equivalents such as Overweight or Outperform), it tells you that analysts have a strong belief that the stock will move higher.\n\nThat kind of information brings clarity. And that clarity is essential in times when economic indicators are sending conflicting signals. Here are seven analyst-backed stocks with several analyst upgrades in the 30 days ending April 10, 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAnalyst-Backed Stocks: Micron Technology (MU) An outside image of a Micron Technology, Inc. headquarters. MU stock. momentum stocks to buy soon\n\nSource: Charles Knowles / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) leads this group of analyst-backed stocks with 22 upgrades. Many of the upgrades are above the stock\u2019s consensus price target of $121.35.\n\nThe company is one of the leading providers of memory chips that are becoming essential as companies add artificial intelligence (AI) functionality. AI models require a tremendous amount of data, which then requires high bandwidth memory (HBM). And Micron continues to be a leader in the HBM sector. As evidence of that, the company\u2019s newest solution, the HBM3E will be embedded into the new Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) H200 graphic processing unit (GPU).\n\nMU stock is up 92% in the last year which may explain why short interest is up more than 9% in the last month. But with bullish analyst sentiment acting as a tailwind, any pullback can set the stage for the next move higher.\n\nThe next catalyst for Micron is likely to come from their earnings report in June. That makes this a good time to take a position as the stock is giving you a small pullback.\n\nSentinelOne (S) The logo for SentinelOne (S) is seen on on an office building.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nSentinelOne (NASDAQ:S) is another of the top analyst-backed stocks with eight recent upgrades. Cybersecurity will continue to be one of the top sectors for investors in 2024. Much of that demand is being driven by AI. So, it stands to reason that SentinelOne\u2019s AI-driven cybersecurity solutions will be in demand.\n\nThat\u2019s certainly the sentiment of analysts from Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) that upgraded SentinelOne from a Neutral to a Buy with a $35 price target in February in support of the company\u2019s competitive positioning, which has to do with its leadership in AI-based cybersecurity.\n\nStory continues\n\nSentinelOne is not turning a profit, yet. And at a time when investors have less of an appetite for the risk that comes with those stocks, the company closed that gap significantly last year and expects to close it even more in 2024.\n\nLike many tech stocks, S stock has had a sharp pullback in the last 30 days. But with analysts giving the stock a consensus price target of $29.96, investors have the potential for 32% upside. And 19 out of 32 analysts give SentinelOne either a Strong Buy or Buy rating.\n\nAnalyst-Backed Stocks: Williams-Sonoma (WSM) Williams-Sonoma (WSM) store in a shopping mall\n\nSource: designs by Jack / Shutterstock.com\n\nI recently put Williams-Sonoma (NYSE:WSM) on a list of stocks to buy based on bullish analyst calls, and it\u2019s worth repeating my bullish call here. Although analysts put a consensus Hold on WSM stock, the company has received 12 upgrades in the 30 days ending on April 10, 2024.\n\nOn the one hand, market bears can say that, even with 12 upgrades, WSM is still a Hold. On the other hand, the company beat on earnings every quarter in 2023 even though the earnings were lower year-over-year. And that speaks to the idea that Williams-Sonoma can still command the 20.1% operating margin that it reported in its March earnings report.\n\nWSM stock has pulled back about 5% the week of April 8. That\u2019s likely some profit taking as investors come to grips with any rate cuts moving further down the calendar in 2024, if they arrive at all. But this is a company with a more affluent target market that is more able to manage through inflation.\n\nOccidental Petroleum (OXY) Person holding cellphone with logo of American company Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs you might expect, several energy stocks \u2013 and specifically oil and gas stocks \u2013 have been getting upgrades. Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) is one of the stocks that should be on investors\u2019 radars with six analyst upgrades.\n\nOccidental is a favorite of Warren Buffett who continues to invest heavily in OXY stock. At the end of 2023, Buffett owns over 25% of the company\u2019s stock. The legendary investor believes in the company\u2019s turnaround story and in how Occidental is well positioned to deliver value to shareholders. That value is becoming clear in the company\u2019s dividend. After cutting the dividend in 2020, the company has raised its quarterly dividend from a penny per share in 2022 to its current amount of 22 cents per share.\n\nIt\u2019s fair to point out that Buffett likes OXY for its sustainability initiatives as well as its assets in the Permian basin. But the latter certainly doesn\u2019t hurt. Especially as oil prices are now over $85 a barrel and likely headed higher in the next 12 months.\n\nAnalyst-Backed Stocks: Netflix (NFLX) Netflix (NFLX) stock index is seen on a smartphone screen. It is an American subscription streaming service and production company\n\nSource: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com\n\nNetflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is another one of the heavily analyst-backed stocks with 10 recent upgrades. That\u2019s despite an 83% gain in NFLX stock in the last year. Netflix has silenced many naysayers (full disclosure, yours truly among them) by not only retaining subscribers but growing its base.\n\nThe streaming giant has leaned into its ad-supported tier and is seeing minimal pushback as it cracks down on passwords. The cherry on top is that the company has managed to increase the rate for its premium, ad-free, tier. And it\u2019s done so without seeing much consumer attrition.\n\nOh, and the company also signed a multi-year contract with the WWE that is the company\u2019s first foray into the coveted live sports market. While the company says it has no long-term plans for the space, it may turn out to be too lucrative to pass up.\n\nIn fairness, since late March, NFLX stock has found firm resistance at its 52-week high. However, the company reports earnings on April 18, 2024, which could very well be the next catalyst to send the stock soaring higher.\n\nDollar General (DG) The front of a Dollar General (DG Stock) store on a sunny day.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe latest readings on inflation show that it\u2019s moving higher. But consumers have known that, especially those that do the shopping for their household. That\u2019s why it was surprising that the discount retailer, Dollar General (NYSE:DG) was down 29% in the last 12 months.\n\nThe key story for the company is location more than pricing. Despite its name it may not have the lowest price on items you might buy at a store like Walmart (NYSE:WMT). But the company\u2019s business model places its stores in rural areas or in areas that are otherwise not being served by big-box retailers. That means consumers are saving money on gas as well as their purchases, which can tip the scale in favor of Dollar General.\n\nThe company has been disappointing on the earnings front as inflation hits discount retailers particularly hard. However, DG stock has 10 recent upgrades and is one of the top analyst-backed stocks. the stock is also up about 12% in 2024 which signals that sentiment could be turning around for DG stock.\n\nFor that turnaround to fully take shape may take an interest rate cut. That would be inflationary for consumers, but it may help Dollar General with its margins.\n\nMadrigal Pharmaceuticals (MDGL) OLK Stock. Modern Medical Research Laboratory: Two Scientists Wearing Face Masks use Microscope, Analyse Sample in Petri Dish, Talk. Advanced Scientific Lab for Medicine, Biotechnology. Blue Color. KZR stock. RSLS stock. Best Biotech Stocks to Buy\n\nSource: Gorodenkoff / Shutterstock.com\n\nFor investors who follow the biotech sector, Madrigal Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:MDGL) has been a big winner. In March 2024, Madrigal received accelerated approval for Reziffra, the company\u2019s treatment for adults with noncirrhotic nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) that includes moderate to advanced liver fibrosis. The drug must be used as part of a program that includes diet and exercise.\n\nThere are an estimated 6 to 8 million adults with NASH in the U.S. alone. And this is the first treatment for those patients.\n\nAt this time, Reziffra is only approved for NASH. But it\u2019s important to note that a key component of Reziffra is a thyroid hormone receptor agonist, Resmetirom. Since thyroid hormones impact metabolism, if that hormone activity increases, as it will with Reziffra, patients may experience increased fat burning and weight loss.\u00a0There is a high correlation between excess weight and liver disease. Resmetirom also positively influences heart-related lipids and LDL cholesterol.\n\nWill these be future indications? It\u2019s too early to tell, but the price action in MDGL stock suggests that it may not be too early for analysts to speculate.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Two prominent proxy advisory firms are advising stockholders to cast votes this month that would limit the power of Solomon, with results due to be tallied at the company\u2019s annual meeting on April 24.\n\nThe proposal that garnered a stamp of approval from Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass, Lewis & Co. would split the CEO and chairman roles, both currently occupied by Solomon. A similar proposal last year did not pass, winning only 16% of votes.\n\nGlass Lewis is separately suggesting that stockholders also vote against Goldman\u2019s executive pay plan due to a \"significant disconnect between pay and performance.\" ISS provided \"cautionary support\" for the executive pay plan.\n\nSolomon\u2019s 2023 compensation rose 24% \u2014 to $31 million \u2014 despite a profit decline of the same amount.\n\nNot only is that up from the $25 million he was awarded in 2022, it is more than his rivals Brian Moynihan, Charles Scharf, and Jane Fraser made at Bank of America (BAC) and Wells Fargo (WFC), and Citigroup (C).\n\nOnly JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon and outgoing Morgan Stanley (MS) CEO James Gorman were awarded more for their 2023 performance.\n\nA lot is in flux at Goldman as key executives depart, raising new questions about the race to eventually succeed Solomon.\n\nOne surprise exit in 2024 is Jim Esposito, who had been co-head of Goldman\u2019s global banking and markets division and is leaving after nearly three decades.

When insiders buy their own company shares, does that mean they know something outsiders don\u2019t and they are piling into their company shares to profit in the long term? Many research papers would answer this question with a \u201cyes\u201d albeit with many ifs and buts. For example a research paper entitled \u201cInsider Trading Patterns\u201d tries to find out why and when insiders buy their own company names. The research, conducted by Lee Biggerstaff, David Cicerob and M. Babajide Wintoki, says that duration is very important while analyzing insider trades. When insiders buy or sell a stock for a long period of time, they may have a \u201clonger-lived\u201d informational advantage. The research said when controlled for duration, insider buying and selling transactions can predict \u201csizable abnormal returns on average.\u201d\n\nInsiders Preserve Their \"Informational Advantage\"\n\nThe research paper also concludes that insiders tend to \u201cpreserve\u201d their informational advantage by disclosing their trades usually after the market closes. They also trade in a sequence of trades and trade more shares because of this disclosure pattern.\n\nWhat does \u201csequence\u201d of trades mean? The research paper says when an insider has an informational advantage of significant importance, they will try to avoid \u201cconspicuously\u201d large trades and instead try to spread their trades over a long period of time leading up to the key event about which they might be aware of. For example, if an executive is aware that his company is about to lose a key business relationship in the future, or an important R&D project is progressing positively towards its goal, they would begin to initiate insider trades with by careful sequencing instead of immediately buying or selling company shares in hefty amounts.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cPrior research has shown that larger trades tend to move prices and trade prices convey information about firm values to the market (Meulbroek, 1992; Gloston and Milgrom, 1985). Optimal trading strategies based on private information therefore involve sequences of trades to avoid sending strong signals (Kyle, 1985). In addition, according to a 2000 internal S.E.C. memorandum discussing the investigation of insider trading, one of the most relevant factors is the size of a trade, so those trading on private information have an incentive to avoid conspicuously large trades (Foster, 2000). Sequences of trades spread over longer horizons may therefore be motivated by private information that takes longer to be incorporated into prices. The alternative null hypothesis is that insiders spread their trades over longer periods of time when they are trading for liquidity or diversification purposes. There may be less immediacy to these trades if insiders are not trying to exploit a temporary informational advantage. Insiders may spread these trades out over time because they still face the reality that the market has limited depth and larger trades tend to move prices, which could cause them to realize less favorable average trading prices. Consistent with this expectation, Lebedeva, Maug, and Schneider (2012) demonstrate that insiders spread their trades out over time when they face liquidity constraints.\u201d Buy-Rated Stocks with Latest Insider Purchases\n\nPhoto by Ruben Sukatendel on Unsplash\n\nWhich Industries are Seeing Insider Buying in 2024?\n\nAre insiders buying or selling in 2024? According to an interesting analysis conducted by CDT Capital Management, a long-only hedge fund that keenly tracks insider activity, insiders started piling into the market in March after a two-month \u201chiatus.\u201d CDT Insider Sentiment Ratio was 2.14 in March, which shows a strong insider sentiment.\u00a0 Among the most active sectors seeing insider activity in March 2024 included Software, Restaurants and Banks.\n\nCDT said that insiders are apparently late to the party and it\u2019s puzzling why insiders, who are usually contrarians, started buying during the Q1 rally. Many believe the market rally led by AI is spreading to other stocks and CDT also thinks this explains the latest insider buying activity:\n\n\u201cOur conclusion is that we suspect the market rally that we observed in Q1 has and will likely continue to broaden out to other sectors of the market. With more and more insiders raising their hand to proclaim untapped value, we expect the sectors of the market that have not received their fair share of attention will likely get some of the limelight in the near to medium term.\u201d\n\nInsider Monkey\u2019s monthly newsletter and\u00a0portfolio that focuses on activist hedge funds, insider trading and stock picks from hedge fund investor newsletters and conferences returned 199.2% between March 2017 and March 12, 2024 and outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs\u2019 144.9% gain by more than 54 percentage points. Some of the top stocks popular among hedge funds include Bank Of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), Coca-Cola Co (NYSE:KO) and Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY).\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we first used a stock screener to identify stocks that saw insider buying activity over the past few days. We then narrowed down to the companies with Buy or better ratings from Wall Street analysts. We then calculated upside potential of these stocks based on average analyst price estimates for these companies and chose 10 of these stocks with the highest upside potential.\n\n10. CNX Resources Corp (NYSE:CNX)\n\nAverage Analyst Price Target: $94\n\nUpside Potential: 60%\n\nCustomer engagement and business performance solutions company CNX Resources Corp\u00a0(NYSE:CNX)\u00a0is one of the buy-rated stocks with recent insider purchases.\u00a0On April 3, 2024, Jane Fogarty, the Executive Vice President of Legal at Concentrix, bought 400 shares of CNX Resources Corp\u00a0(NYSE:CNX)\u00a0at $61.04 apiece. Since this transaction the stock has gained about 2%.\n\nLongleaf Partners Small-Cap Fund made the following comment about CNX Resources Corporation (NYSE:CNX) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cCNX Resources Corporation (NYSE:CNX) \u2013 Natural gas company CNX Resources was the top performer in the quarter. The company benefited from rising energy prices, as well as strong operational execution. CNX remains highly discounted, as the market does not give the company credit for its longer-term undrilled assets or its \u201cnew technology investments,\u201d which include methods to reduce carbon on a net basis. Management expects this to be a material business for CNX over the longer term, but for now it is a high-quality hidden asset. CNX has taken advantage of the price disconnect through meaningful share repurchase.\u201d\n\n9.
