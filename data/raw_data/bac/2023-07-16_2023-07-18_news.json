Here's a look at some of the top stories of the day. Former president Donald Trump is facing the possibility of a second federal indictment in connection with efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Trump posting on Truth Social that he received a letter from special counsel Jack Smith. This is possibly the clearest sign. Yet, he could face those charges heading into the 2024 race.\n\nDespite legal headwinds, Trump is still leading in the polls. Banks in focus on Wall Street on the heels of earnings from Bank of America and Morgan Stanley. Bank of America beating on the top and bottom lines telling our own Brian Sozzi earlier that the consumer is resilient. Meantime, Morgan Stanley shares jumping after better than expected second quarter results.

Vacancies are rising and values are falling, and it\u2019s all happening in an era of higher interest rates and tightened credit. Banks are taking notice of the distress within commercial real estate, and in some cases, with their own office loan portfolios, they\u2019re bracing for losses.\n\nMorgan Stanley reported its financial results for the second quarter of 2023 this week, which stated: \u201cincreases in provisions for credit losses were primarily driven by credit deteriorations in the commercial real estate sector as well as modest growth across the portfolio.\u201d Morgan Stanley\u2019s provision for credit losses rose from $82 million in the second quarter of last year to $97 million, where it currently stands.\n\nBank of America also reported its earnings for the quarter, showing an increase in its allowance for credit losses. For commercial real estate, that rose from $1.2 billion in the first quarter of this year to $1.3 billion in the second quarter. Among its commercial real estate loans, 25% are in the office category, totaling to $18.3 billion. In a breakdown of Bank of America\u2019s scheduled office loan maturities, we can see that $6.3 billion worth of loans are coming due in 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, Wells Fargo\u2019s chief executive officer, Charlie Scharf, said the bank experienced \u201chigher losses in commercial real estate, primarily in the office portfolio,\u201d per its earnings report released last week.\n\nScharf continued: \u201cWe had a $949 million increase in the allowance for credit losses, primarily for commercial real estate office loans, as well as for higher credit card loan balances. While we haven\u2019t seen significant losses in our office portfolio to-date, we are reserving for the weakness that we expect to play out in that market over time.\u201d\n\nFurther down in the earnings report, that $949 million increase in the allowance for credit losses was labeled as primarily for commercial real estate office loans. Still Wells Fargo\u2019s commercial real estate revenue increased to $1.33 billion, up 2% from the previous quarter and 26% from the previous year. Whether that positive trend will continue, we\u2019ll have to wait and see, given the bank attributed the increase to \u201chigher interest rates and higher loan balances.\u201d\n\nWells Fargo had $154.3 billion worth of commercial real estate loans outstanding at the end of the second quarter, with $33.1 billion worth of office loans\u2014that\u2019s 3% of its total outstanding loans. How much of that will be maturing in the next year or so, we don\u2019t know. When an analyst asked the bank\u2019s chief financial officer during its earnings call, he responded that they don\u2019t disclose that information, but that we should assume the bank\u2019s loans are three to five years as that\u2019s the standard, according to a transcript of the call.\n\nRegarding JPMorgan, which announced its second-quarter earnings last week, the company reported a provision for credit losses amounting to $1.1 billion. This provision included a reserve of $608 million specifically established for the First Republic portfolio, which JPMorgan acquired in May subsequent to the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.\n\n\u201cExcluding First Republic, the provision [for credit losses] was $489 million, reflecting a net reserve build of $389 million, driven by updates to certain assumptions related to office real estate, as well as net downgrade activity in Middle Market. Net charge-offs of $100 million were predominantly driven by office real estate,\u201d according to the release.\n\nHowever, JPMorgan\u2019s commercial real estate revenue increased to $806 million in the second quarter, from $642 million the previous quarter. In JPMorgan\u2019s earnings call, its chief financial officer told investors and analysts that the bank\u2019s office portfolio is \u201cquite small and our exposure to sort of so-called urban dense office is even smaller. The vast majority of our overall portfolio is multifamily lending,\u201d according to a transcript of the call.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nMore from Fortune: \r\n5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year\u2014all while working from home\r\nLooking to make extra cash?

Yet its shares traded only 0.6% higher in pre-market trading but rising more than 4% after earnings.\u00a0\u00a0On Friday, Citigroup Inc (NYSE: C) reported earnings and revenue beat expectations buy its shares sank 4.05%. Likewise, Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE: WFC) reported better-than-expected top and bottom lines, while also raising its guidance for full-year net interest income but its shares still slipped 0.34%. Even JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE: JPM), known as the great dame of U.S. banks, didn\u2019t manage to rouse investor interest with its net income skyrocketing 67% YoY but its stock only going up 0.6%.\n\nBank Of America\n\nFor its second quarter, Bank of America posted earnings of 88 cents, topping the 84 cents that Wall Street expected, on the back of revenue of $25.33 billion which also topped the expected $25.05 billion due to a 14% rise in interest income amid higher rates that resulted in a revenue rise of 11%. Earnings rose 19% YoY to $7.41 billion. On the other hand, Bank of America also rose its allowance for credit losses on loans from the first quarter\u2019s $900 million to $1.1 billion which translates to a 120% rise compared last year\u2019s reserves.\n\nCitigroup\n\nCitigroup saw its profit shrink more than a third last quarter due to slower corporate spending and costly layoffs, among other factors. As fears of a U.S. recession materialize, net income went down from $4.5 billion it made during last year\u2019s Q2 to $2.9 billion. Like its peers, Citigroup was affected by a slowdown in dealmaking, causing a 1% drop in revenue that amounted to $19.4 billion as corporate and investment banking slowdown caused the segment\u2019s revenue to tank as much as 44%. Its performance was considerably worse compared to its peers.\n\nCitigroup also raised its provision for loan losses nearly 40 per cent to approximately $1.8 billion.\n\nWells Fargo & Company\n\nHaving kicked off the earnings season, Wells Fargo did not see expected damage to its commercial loan portfolio. Its net interest income rose 29% with net income surging 57% to $4.9 billion on the back of revenue rising 20% to $20.5 billion.\n\nIt also boosted its provisions for credit losses rose 43% compared to first quarter to $1.713 billion, which is 195% above the $580 million it reported in 2022\u2019s Q2. CEO Charlie Scharf noted that the allowance was primarily related to its expectations of commercial real estate office loans which, according to Bloomberg data, make up about 22% of its outstanding commercial property loans.\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co\n\nJPMorgan Chase posted a 67% jump in Q2\u00a0\u00a0profit as it earned more from borrowers' interest payments and benefited from the purchase of regional lender First Republic Bank.\n\nView more earnings on BAC\n\nJP Morgan revenue rose 34% to $42.4 billion as the bank made good use of higher rates and solid loan growth, with net income surging 67% to $14.5 billion, JPMorgan also increased its net interest income guidance the full year by $3 million to $87 billion compared to its May outlook.\u00a0\u00a0Net interest income forecast for the year was also hiked from prior 10% growth projection to 14%. JPMorgan\u2019s credit loss provisions also expanded 62% from 2022\u2019s Q2 and 27% from the previous quarter, this year\u2019s Q1, to $2.9 billion.\n\nHealth of the banking system is better than expected, but there\u2019s increased caution regarding what lies ahead.\n\nAlong with Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS), five of the six largest U.S. banks largely topped Q2 estimates,\u00a0\u00a0fueled by higher net interest income that came with higher interest rates. But the market\u2019s response was muted. The big picture is that the banking system is healthier than expected, at least for the largest players, as Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management, concluded in his note. However, the results did show clear signs that increased caution is in the air as all the above banks rose increased their funds for anticipated losses. Morgan Stanley, who also reported today, also followed this trend with a 59% rise in credit loss provisions that amounted to $161 million.\u00a0However, Mulberry believes this is simply prudent risk management that protects against worst-case scenario, if there is one, as opposed to a warning of doomsday.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

record high", "content": "Investing.com -- The S&P 500 delivered swashbuckling gains Tuesday as investors cheered better-than-expected quarterly results from a slew of major corporations including Wall Street banks and a record high in Microsoft amid AI-optimism.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.1%, or 366 points, the Nasdaq was up 0.8%, and the S&P 500 rose 0.7% to end the day at 52-week highs.\n\nWall Street banks continue to impress on earnings stage\n\nBank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) led the move higher in banking stocks, rising more than 4% after reporting second-quarter earnings that topped analyst estimates as higher interest rates boosted loan income.\n\nMorgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), meanwhile, rallied 6% after its second-quarter results beat estimates on both the top and bottom lines as performance in its wealth management business offset weakness in its trading business amid a drop in equity and fixed-income revenue.\n\nCharles Schwab Corp (NYSE:SCHW) topped the list of gainers, up more than 12% following its better-than-expected quarterly results.\n\nMicrosoft drives big tech higher after hitting record high flexing AI muscle\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) rose 4% as investors piled into the stock on AI-optimism after the tech giant said it would charge businesses $30 per user to access the tech giant\u2019s suite of artificial intelligence tool.\n\nThe initial pricing details are \u201cvery bullish for the total addressable cloud AI market opportunity for Microsoft that could increase cloud revenue annually by 20% by 2025 based on our estimate,\u201d Wedbush said in a note.\n\nTesla, Netflix race higher as earnings come into focus\n\nTesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) were in rally mode ahead of the quarterly results due Wednesday after the market closes.\n\nFor Tesla's quarterly results, the focus will likely be on margins following the electric vehicle maker\u2019s recent price cuts, while investor focus on Netflix\u2019s quarterly results will likely center on the boost to subscriber numbers as well as guidance following the streaming giant\u2019s crackdown on password sharing.\n\nWeaker retail sales flag slowing consumer, but July hike still in play\n\nRetail sales rose 0.2% in June following a 0.5% gain the month prior, missing economists\u2019 estimates for a rise 0.5% and providing further optimism that the Federal Reserve\u2019s series of rate hikes delivered so far are starting to slow the economy.\n\nStill, economists continue to expect the Fed to lift rates for one final time next week.\n\nThe positive retail sales figure for June suggests the economy continued to grow at a moderate pace, Desjardins said in a note, and [the] \u201cFed is therefore likely to announce one last 25 basis point increase in July.\u201d\n\nRelated Articles\n\nStock market today: Dow extends gains as banks shine, Microsoft hits record high\n\nAfter-hours movers: Carvana falls after pushing up EPS

Profit jumped 19% year-over-year and the second quarter to $7.4 billion or $0.88 a share. That's ahead of forecast expectations of $0.84 a share.\n\nNow, BofA's net interest income also rising 14% to meet expectations at $14.2 billion. But it indeed falls short of JP Morgan's 44% jump last week. Now, Brian Moynihan calls it quote, \"one of the strongest quarters in the company's history.\" Of course, don't miss our interview with Bank of America CEO at 3 PM Eastern Time.\n\nJoining us for analysis on the quarterly results, we have Dick Bove, Odeon Capital Group financial strategist. Dick, thanks so much for joining us once again. So let's jump right into the results from Bank of America today.\n\nIt was a beat. You had an initial pop in the pre-market in response to its earnings. It's cooled a bit, as they handle their earnings call. What's your first takeaway?\n\nDICK BOVE: Well, I think that what you're seeing is that on a year-over-year basis, the numbers look pretty good. But on a quarter-over-quarter basis, it shows that the there is some weakness developing.\n\nAnd I think that's a traditional-- well, I shouldn't say, traditional. I think it's similar to what other banks are showing in the quarter. In other words, what we're seeing is if you're solely in the banking business, a PNC, for example, you're not doing particularly well. If you have a big capital markets operation to assist you, and JP Morgan or a company like Wells Fargo, which you're seeing is some strength in that area.\n\nSo I'd say that what Bank of America is doing at the present time is showing those trends. The banking industry weakened. The banking business weakened in the quarter-over-quarter results. And they were surprisingly strong in the capital markets arena. And I think if you're looking forward for banking, again, you have to make your call on whether there's going to be a recession or not.\n\nBut if you're looking forward, I think that the trends that you're likely to see are similar to what we saw in this quarter. I think that you're going to see capital markets activity being very strong over the next few quarters. You're going to see banking being lackluster.\n\nYou'll see some little pickup, maybe in commercial industrial lending. But home mortgages should be flat. And you should see credit card lending, which was extremely strong coming down somewhat as people are borrowing a little bit too much right now for their income.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Yeah. We did see an increase in credit card write offs for Bank of America. Although, it's still well below where it was even pre-pandemic, which is interesting. Something else that stuck out to me Dick is consumer unit deposits, which were down 1% quarter-over-quarter.\n\nOn a relative basis on that front, how is Bank of America doing versus its competitors?\n\nDICK BOVE: Well, again, JP Morgan's numbers are all messed up because of the acquisition of First Republic. If you took the First Republic numbers out of JP Morgan, OK, you would see that JP Morgan's, if you will, organic numbers were down across the board.\n\nSo I know people get very enthused about the JP Morgan numbers. But they tend to forget that they're not as a result of organic growth at JP Morgan. The result of a major acquisition, which gave them $2.7 billion in profits.\n\nAll right. So if you take a look at the deposits at JP Morgan, you take a look at the deposits at Wells Fargo, if you take a look at the deposits at Bank of America, they're all feeling the same stress. And they're feeling that stress for a very logical reason.\n\nThe banks are cheating the depositors. Basically, the banks got this huge windfall gain as a result of something that they had nothing to do with the fed increased interest rates. And they didn't pass it along to their depositors. So the result is that on a deposit basis, even the big banks are showing declines in deposits, despite this theory that everybody's taking money out of the regional banks and putting it into the big banks. I'm not seeing that.\n\nAlthough, PNC's deposit numbers were not particularly good at all in this quarter. I think that if the banks want these deposits back, it's easy to get them back. All they have to do is raise their rates closer to a market rate. They are reluctant to do that however because their margins are not doing well.\n\nThey're in a box because the yield on their assets are not enough to allow them to pay market rates on deposits. So they don't pay market rates on deposits. And the deposits go to money market funds or other areas. But they don't stay in these banks.\n\nDIANE KING HALL: So in their earnings report, net charge offs increased to $869 million. So it's up from a year ago. And total loan loss levels are at $602 million. Is that concerning at all for you for Bank of America. Dick?\n\nDICK BOVE: Yes, it is. I think that what you're going to see is a very, very significant increase in loan losses in the consumer sector over the next couple of quarters.\n\nI can give you a simple example, which tends to bear what I'm talking about. One of my friends called me the other day and said that he bought a car three years ago for $63,000. The blue book value of that car today is $36,000. But the size of his loan is $45,000. And he's got four years to go in paying for that loan.\n\nIf you multiply him by hundred of thousands of auto buyers over the last three years, you'll find that they're in a similar situation because used car prices are coming down. And they took these six- and seven-year loans outstanding. And that is going to hit them hard. And not every one of them is going to continue to make the auto payment. And if unemployment were to rise at all, then you would see a substantial increase.\n\nThe same deal is going on with credit cards. People got this huge largesse in terms of all of this money dumped into their pocket by the government, a few years ago. That money is now been spent. And so now, they're borrowing. And they're not borrowing on necessities. They're borrowing on tourism, on homes outside the house, on a variety of recreational products.\n\nI think the consumer is in a very vulnerable position. And I think that loan losses will increase substantially as they said a minute ago, over the next few quarters.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: And Dick, just finally, quickly, I want to ask you about Morgan Stanley on the other side of the spectrum. the non-consumer bank side of the spectrum. Because they're, too, even though at some of its competitors trading operations were a little bit stronger, Morgan Stanley's results were middling, I guess. Is that your assessment?\n\nDICK BOVE: They disappointed me because I raised the rating on Morgan Stanley last Thursday expecting that they would show much stronger results in investment banking, and better trading. I realize that trading would not be good because it just hasn't been good for anyone, except for Bank of America.\n\nAnd I realized that the first two months of the quarter were not great in investment banking. But June was so strong in terms of a massive increase in M&A activity and in equity offerings. That I thought Morgan Stanley would do much better than it has. So I'm disappointed by those results.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Dick, it's good to see you. Dick Bove, Odeon Capital Group financial strategist, and on the topic of financials and of Bank of America.

Revenues for trading equities and fixed income fell 22% from a year ago and more than 19% from the previous quarter.\n\nInvestment banking revenues were flat when compared to a year ago and down from the first quarter.\n\nMorgan Stanley's sizable wealth management business helped offset some of that weaknesses. Revenues in that unit were up 16% from a year ago, to $6.7 billion.\n\n\"The quarter started with macroeconomic uncertainties and subdued client activity, but ended with a more constructive tone,\" Gorman added. \"We remain confident in our ability to grow in various market environments while maintaining a strong capital position.\" Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman.

Revenues from those businesses dropped during the last quarter at Citigroup (C), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), but were up at Bank of America (BAC).\n\nThose results do not bode well for rival Goldman Sachs (GS), which is scheduled to report its results tomorrow. Goldman also relies heavily on deal making and trading for revenue but has a much smaller wealth management business than Morgan Stanley.\n\nGoldman is expected to show an investment banking revenue decline of 32% from a year ago and a trading decline of 17%, according to analyst estimates.\n\nThat could intensify the scrutiny of CEO David Solomon, who is wrestling with partner unrest and concerns about strategy as he tries to put a consumer-banking experiment behind the company. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)\n\nGoldman is \"indicating that the second quarter might be \u2018throw the kitchen sink in\u2019 with larger write offs of some of these non-core businesses,\" Ken Leon, CFRA research director of equity research, told Yahoo Finance Friday.\n\nThus there will be a focus on Solomon and \"whether he can show the strategy they have is going to work,\" Leon said. \"It is going to be a tough issue\" for the CEO.\n\nGerard Cassidy, a banking analyst with RBC Capital Markets, told Yahoo Finance Monday that if Solomon is unable to put together a plan showing how the bank will return to its profits of old, \"his tenure there could be in trouble.\"\n\n'Too early'\n\nThe global slowdown in dealmaking began last year, following a boom in 2021, causing firms across Wall Street to slash bonuses and staff. It continued in 2023. This year, worldwide investment banking revenues for the second quarter fell 52% from a year ago, according to Dealogic.\n\nCitigroup, Morgan Stanley, Goldman and other firms with big investment banking and trading units have made or announced cuts of roughly 12,000 jobs since the end of 2022.\n\nSome observers are still predicting \"green shoots\" ahead, citing an uptick in announced M&A deals over the second quarter which could mean an improvement during the back half of 2023.\n\nJPMorgan Chief Financial Officer Jeremy Barnum on Friday said investment banking was better than expected in June, but cautioned analysts that it was \u201ctoo early\u201d to label it a trend.\n\n\"We will see,\" he said. For overall capital markets \"July should be a good indicator for the remainder of the year.\"\n\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/morgan-stanley-profits-drop-14-on-wall-street-slump-115111697.html", "symbols": ["0Q16.LSE", "0R01.LSE", "BAC-PB.US", "BAC-PE.US", "BAC-PK.US", "BAC-PL.US", "BAC.MX", "BAC.US", "BML-PL.US", "BOAC34.SA", "C-PJ.US", "C.MX", "C.US", "CMC.F", "CMC.XETRA", "CTGP34.SA", "DWD.F", "DWD.XETRA", "GOS.F", "GOS.XETRA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.984, "neg": 0.028, "neu": 0.906, "pos": 0.066}}, {"date": "2023-07-18T11:34:59+00:00", "title": "Big Banks Are Paying Up For Deposits, But Deposits Are Still Shrinking", "content": "Banks took in tons of deposits [during the pandemic](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-coronavirus-is-doing-weird-things-to-the-banking-industry-11598779800).

Meanwhile, drug-making giant Novartis improves its guidance as it eyes a spin-off of its Sandoz generics division later this year, and Cathie Wood says her ARK investment management firm has written down its stake in Twitter.\n\n1. Bank of America, Morgan Stanley on deck\n\nCorporate earnings Tuesday will include a fresh batch of U.S. banks, with investors keen to see how they have fared since the turmoil in regional lenders hit the financial services sector earlier this year.\n\nBank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) are set to report their latest results before the start of U.S. trading, as well as smaller players Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) and PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC).\n\nLast week, higher interest rates helped underpin improved targets for net interest income \u2013 the difference between what a bank makes from loans and pays for deposits \u2013 at larger peers JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) and Citigroup (NYSE:C). Second quarter net income also jumped at JPMorgan and Wells Fargo, although a dearth of dealmaking weighed on profit at Citigroup.\n\n2. U.S. futures mixed\n\nU.S. stock futures were largely mixed on Tuesday as traders awaited the next round of earnings.\n\nAt 04:45 ET (08:45 GMT), the Dow futures contract gained 22 points or 0.06%, S&P 500 futures edged up by 1 point or 0.02%, and Nasdaq 100 futures lost 6 points or 0.04%.\n\nThe main indices closed in the green in the prior session, boosted in part by a stronger-than-anticipated reading from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's manufacturing index that hinted at resilient business activity in the face of elevated borrowing costs.\n\nCoupled with last week's June inflation reading that was slower than expected and a jump in preliminary consumer sentiment for July, the manufacturing survey bolstered hopes for continued strength in the broader U.S. economy.\n\n3. Novartis lifts profit guidance, lays out timeline for Sandoz spin-off\n\nNovartis raised its profit and revenue outlook for 2023 following solid second quarter sales, while the Swiss drugmaker also proposed a timeline for the spin-off of its Sandoz generic medicines unit.\n\nSales increased by 7% to $13.7 billion at constant currencies, which chief executive Vas Narasimhan said was linked to strong performance across \"core therapeutic areas and key geographies.\" As a result, the company said it now estimates that annual group sales will grow in the high single digit, an improvement from the prior guidance of mid-single-digit. Yearly group core operating income expansion is now seen in the low double digits, up from the high-single-digit previously.\n\nMeanwhile, Novartis said its shareholders will vote on the planned Sandoz spin-off at an extraordinary general meeting in September. If approved, a listing on the SIX Swiss Exchange, as well as an American Depositary Receipt program in the U.S., could come as soon as early in the fourth quarter.\n\nShares in Novartis (SIX:NOVN) rose in early trading in Switzerland on Monday, while Novartis ADRs (NYSE:NVS) in the U.S. also ticked higher in premarket dealmaking.\n\n4. Wood's ARK writes down Twitter stake - WSJ\n\nCathie Wood's ARK Investment Management has written down its stake in Twitter by 47% since Elon Musk bought the social media platform and took it private last year, Wood told the Wall Street Journal.\n\nIn an interview with the paper, Wood noted that the write-down reflects how ARK, which owns a small stake in Twitter through its venture fund, takes fair valuation \"very seriously.\" But she remained upbeat about the prospects for Twitter, saying she would \"love\" to snap up more shares at the new value.\n\nIn particular, Wood said she still thinks Musk is \"serious\" about his plan to turn Twitter into a so-called \"everything app\" that features a wide range of services like messaging, e-commerce shopping, and peer-to-peer payments.\n\nWood's comments come as Twitter faces a large debt pile and dwindling advertising revenues, while Musk himself said over the weekend that the company is now cash-flow negative.\n\nAt the same time, Twitter must contend with fresh competition from Meta's (NASDAQ:META) own short-text messaging platform Threads. Wood, however, argued that this rivalry could light a competitive \"fire\" under Twitter.\n\n5. Oil steadies as U.S. inventory data looms\n\nCrude prices edged up on Tuesday, with the focus turning from concerns over economic weakness in top oil importer China towards a potential tightening of U.S. crude supplies.\n\nTraders are awaiting new figures from the American Petroleum Institute later in the session, as well as numbers from the Energy Information Administration on Wednesday. The data is expected to show a decline in stockpiles after a substantially bigger-than-anticipated build in the prior week.\n\nBut sentiment is still dampened by statistics on Monday that showed underwhelming growth in China in the second quarter. Investors are now trying to gauge if Beijing will roll out further stimulus measures in an attempt to refuel the country's sputtering post-pandemic recovery.\n\nBy 08:45 ET, the U.S. crude futures traded 0.31% higher at $74.31 a barrel, while the Brent contract added 0.15% to $78.62 per barrel.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nEarnings wave, Novartis guidance, ARK's Twitter stake - what's moving markets\n\nIMF chief: Prospects for medium-term global growth weak\n\nECB hawk says bank will carefully weigh inflation data after July", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-wave-novartis-guidance-arks-052654858.html", "symbols": ["BAC.US", "BK.US", "C.US", "JPM.US", "META.US", "MS.US", "NOTA.F", "NOVN.SW", "NVS.US", "NVSEF.US", "PNC.US", "WFC.US"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.99, "neg": 0.044, "neu": 0.859, "pos": 0.098}}, {"date": "2023-07-17T23:18:43+00:00", "title": "Asian stocks pressured by China jitters, India outperforms", "content": "Investing.com-- Most Asian stocks moved in a flat-to-low range on Tuesday amid persistent concerns over slowing economic growth in China, while Indian stocks eyed new highs on the back of a positive earnings season.\n\nRegional financial stocks saw some buying ahead of key earnings from some of the biggest American banks this week, including Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).\n\nWall Street indexes also closed higher overnight, offering some positive cues to local stocks.\n\nBut this was largely offset by weak economic indicators from China, after data showed that growth in the country\u2019s gross domestic product slowed in the second quarter. The reading triggered steep losses in Chinese stocks, which extended into Tuesday.\n\nChinese stocks fall further, stimulus measures in focus\n\nHong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index was the worst performer in Asia on Tuesday, tumbling nearly 2% in catch-up trade after adverse weather conditions suspended trading on Monday.\n\nLosses were concentrated in locally-listed Chinese real estate and technology stocks, with heavyweights including Baidu (HK:9888) (NASDAQ:BIDU), Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (HK:9988) (NYSE:BABA) and Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700) seeing a heavy dose of profit taking after strong gains last week.\n\nChina\u2019s Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 and Shanghai Composite indexes also fell about 0.4% each, extending losses from Monday. But their pace of losses somewhat slowed as the weak economic data pushed up expectations for more stimulus measures in China.\r\nLocal media reports suggested that the People\u2019s Bank of China could cut its key interest rates and bank reserve requirements in the third quarter, to unlock more liquidity. PBOC officials have also flagged more policy support in recent weeks.\n\nBut concerns over a Chinese slowdown weighed on most broader Asian markets. South Korea\u2019s KOSPI and the Taiwan Weighted index shed 0.4% each, while Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 index fell slightly after a long weekend.\n\nAustralia\u2019s ASX 200 fell 0.4% as the minutes of the Reserve Bank\u2019s July meeting showed that the lender was still considering more rate hikes, despite a pause earlier this month.\n\nIndian stocks at record highs amid positive earnings\n\nSingapore-traded futures for India\u2019s Nifty 50 index pointed to a flat open on Tuesday, after both the Nifty and the BSE Sensex 30 notched record highs in the prior session.\n\nStrength in conglomerate Reliance Industries Ltd (NS:RELI), before the demerger of its financial services unit, and a rally in bank stocks, following strong results from lender HDFC Bank (NS:HDBK), were the biggest drivers of Monday\u2019s gains.\n\nRobust foreign capital inflows, optimism over the Indian economy and a strong start to the second-quarter earnings season were the biggest drivers of a local stock market rally over the past month.\n\nBut analysts have warned that any negative news could trigger a heavy amount of capitulation in Indian stocks.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAsian stocks pressured by China jitters, India outperforms\n\nExclusive-China's CITIC to move dozens of Hong Kong bankers to mainland to cut costs -sources\n\nAustralian developer Lendlease to cut about 740 jobs globally", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/asian-stocks-pressured-china-jitters-231843885.html", "symbols": ["0700.HK", "9888.HK", "9988.HK", "BABA.US", "BAC.US", "BIDU.US", "GS.US", "HSI.INDX", "MS.US"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.913, "neg": 0.08, "neu": 0.821, "pos": 0.099}}, {"date": "2023-07-17T21:36:48+00:00", "title": "Bank earnings, Microsoft-Activision deal, economic data: What to watch on Tuesday", "content": "Yahoo Finance Live breaks down what to watch on Tuesday, including earnings reports from Bank of America (BAC) and Morgan Stanley (MS), as well as the Microsoft-Activision Blizzard deal deadline.

It\u2019s also one of America\u2019s most well-known stocks thanks to Warren Buffett\u2019s 13% ownership stake. While the bank has found itself in a bit of hot water recently, I\u2019ve learned over the years that the Oracle of Omaha isn\u2019t afraid to own controversial stocks that get into trouble with regulators and consumers.\n\nOne that comes to mind is Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC). Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B) held on to shares for several years after it came to light that the bank opened at least 3.5 million fraudulent accounts to meet growth targets. The holding company eventually bailed on the bank stock in mid-2022.\n\nFor its part, Bank of America was recently fined a combined $150 million by two government agencies \u2014 $90 million by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and $60 million by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. In addition, it had to refund $100 million to customers.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\n\u201cBank of America wrongfully withheld credit card rewards, double-dipped on fees, and opened accounts without consent,\u201d CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said in a statement. \u201cThese practices are illegal and undermine customer trust.\u201d\n\nThis wasn\u2019t the first time Bank of America has been fined for illegal practices and it probably won\u2019t be the last. While that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean investors should throw in the towel on the stock (Buffett certainly isn\u2019t), here are three other companies you may want to put on your list of stocks to avoid due to controversies surrounding them.\n\nAlibaba (BABA) A photo of the Alibaba (BABA) app on a smartphone.\n\nSource: BigTunaOnline / Shutterstock.com\n\nThings have gotten so bad for Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) that Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Daniel Zhang stepped down in June after eight years in the top job.\n\nOfficially, Zhang is stepping aside to focus on taking the company\u2019s cloud unit public as part of Alibaba\u2019s plan to split into six units. And many seem to believe the move is a good one.\n\nPer Reuters:\n\n\u201cThe appointment of Daniel to focus on running cloud is really a show of confidence and trust in him to take the most precious business and run with it to develop it in the right way given this age of generative artificial intelligence (AI),\u201d said Brian Wong, a former Alibaba employee and author of the book, \u201cThe Tao of Alibaba\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe idea or expectation that one person could manage the business\u2019 crown jewel Cloud and at the same time manage the entire Alibaba Group is an unreasonable expectation.\u201d\n\nMaybe so, but I find it hard to believe that Alibaba couldn\u2019t have found someone capable of growing the cloud unit.\n\nOn July 10, Alibaba\u2019s share price jumped on news that the $985 million fine levied by Chinese regulators against the company\u2019s Ant Group affiliate could end the government\u2019s crackdown on Chinese tech companies.\n\nZhang presided over the company during the period in question, as well as that of the $2.8 billion antitrust fine it got in 2021. It\u2019s more than possible that he stepped down to appease regulators or, at the very least, to avoid any further confrontation with the government.\n\nOnce upon a time, I thought Alibaba stock was undervalued because of its cloud unit. In May 2019, I suggested a profitable cloud business could help get BABA shares to $250. They surpassed that level in July 2020, riding the pandemic wave. But since topping out later that year above $300, shares have lost around 70% of their value.\n\nGiven the slowdown in Chinese economic growth and continued regulatory uncertainty, it\u2019s best to put BABA on your list of stocks to avoid.\n\nIllumina (ILMN) Illumina (ILMN) logo displayed on reddish stone facade building against blue sky background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/JHVEPhoto\n\nIllumina (NASDAQ:ILMN) stock is down nearly 9% year to date compared with an 18% advance for the S&P 500.\n\nPart of the problem is the San Diego-based biotech firm\u2019s fight with Carl Icahn, who himself is in the crosshairs of short-seller Hindenburg Research, which published a report in May suggesting the billionaire would be subject to margin calls if shares of Icahn Enterprises (NASDAQ:IEP) fell further. Icahn restructured his debt and, as a result, was forced to pledge 95% of his IEP stock as collateral on his new financing.\n\nSo, how does this relate to Illumina?\n\nIcahn owns 1.4% of the biotech company. In May, he won a proxy fight with the company that saw Chairman John Thompson resign, replaced by Icahn appointee Andrew Teno. In addition, the billionaire wanted CEO Francis deSouzato to step down and be replaced by former Illumina CEO Jay Flatley over DeSouza\u2019s controversial $7.1 billion acquisition of gene-sequencing technology company Grail in 2021.\n\nDeSouza eventually stepped down on June 12. One month later, the European Union fined Illumina $475 million for closing the Grail acquisition without its approval. The Federal Trade Commission has also ordered the company to sell Grail because the deal would stifle innovation in cancer testing technology.\n\nIt\u2019s bad enough to be fined nearly half a billion for arrogantly flouting regulators\u2019 wishes. But to be entangled with someone like Icahn, who\u2019s got a history of activism that\u2019s not always a winning hand, leaves me wondering why anyone would bother with ILMN when there are so many other biotechs to choose from.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) Meta Written On The Googles - Man Wearing Virtual Reality Goggles Inside A Metaverse. FTC investigating META.\n\nSource: Aleem Zahid Khan / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) got fined $1.3 billion in May for violating European Union data protection rules. Eventually, North America will get wise to the Facebooks of the world and seriously start protecting consumer privacy.\n\nHere in Canada, where I live, Facebook and Google are acting like spoiled children, threatening to ban news from their Canadian news feeds because a new law was passed on June 22. C-18 requires online advertising behemoths such as Facebook and Google to pay media outlets for sharing their content with social media users.\n\nAs the Los Angeles Times points out, Australia implemented similar legislation in 2021 and it\u2019s been a boon to publishers down under.\n\n\u201cThat bill has already restored tens of millions of dollars in revenue to Australia\u2019s troubled newsrooms, and, while far from perfect, has transformed the media environment dramatically,\u201d wrote columnist Brian Merchant.\n\nMeta and Facebook have been fined more than $6 billion since 2000. That seems like a lot. However, when you consider that Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s wealth in 2023 has increased by nearly $67 billion due in large part to Meta shares\u2019 158% year-to-date gain, it\u2019s a drop in the bucket.\n\nZuckerberg will do whatever he wants, including trampling all over publishers\u2019 intellectual property worldwide. His company has no redeeming qualities. It\u2019s the worst of social media.\n\nInvesting in META is no better than buying tobacco stocks. The sooner investors realize this, the better.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

These attractions could prove irresistible, particularly for those plotting a long-term investment course where valuation and investment return assume a towering significance over time. Yet, the landscape is strewn with dividend stocks offering unsustainable distributions, which could trap investors.\n\nHence, the quest for firms with a robust business model that can uphold their distribution over the long haul becomes massive. Investors get a generous safety net when wagering on shares of undervalued enterprises, not to mention a heftier dividend yield. Discovering such stocks may seem akin to looking for a needle in the haystack, but it\u2019s worth the effort.\n\nTherefore, investing for income is a strategic play that could offer massive long-term rewards. Investing in undervalued dividend stocks puts you in that sweet spot where prudence meets reward.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPrudential\u00a0(PRU) Prudential logo\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nPrudential (NYSE:PRU) is a behemoth in the global financial services realm, continuing to pique investor interest with its tenacity and overall robustness. Despite kicking off 2023 on a rough note, PRU stock is down roughly 8% year-to-date. Much of that has to do with the steep drop in reported revenue and earnings each quarter last year. Nevertheless, its recent record suggests the company continues to navigate choppy waters with its impressively diversified portfolio with aplomb.\n\nPrudential made a statement with a net income of $1.46 billion and revenue of $15.9 billion in its first quarter. Evidently, the firm is back in the saddle, ready to ride the bull market again. Despite its resilience, the stock is trading at just 0.6 times forward sales estimates while yielding a mighty impressive dividend yield of almost 5.5%. Moreover, its dividend payout has risen by 14 consecutive years, significantly adding to its allure.\n\nBank of America (BAC) bank of America stock BAC stock\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nBank of America (NYSE:BAC)\u00a0is effectively riding the turbulent currents of the financial industry. The firm has showcased an admirable knack for charting a path forward, emerging stronger from every challenge that\u2019s come its way. The Silicon Valley Bank debacle in March could have thrown a lesser entity off course, but BAC stood tall amidst the turmoil. Moreover, it welcomed a torrential influx of $15 billion in deposits as investors sought the sturdy shelter of an established player.\n\nBAC delivered spectacular results in the first quarter, blowing past analyst estimates on both lines. The bank\u2019s robust earnings per share growth, a substantial hike in net interest income, and stellar revenue growth across all segments effectively bolster its long-term position. With it managing a whopping $3 trillion in assets and a savory dividend yield of more than 3%, it would be wise to have BAC stock in your portfolios now.\n\nPublic Storage (PSA) a Public Storage sign in front of a facility of storage buildings\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nPublic Storage (NYSE:PSA) is a popular real estate investment trust (REIT) specializing in acquiring and maintaining self-storage properties. Its business has done remarkably well despite the crippling economic headwinds. Moreover, the firm has reported funds from operations (FFO) of $4.08 per diluted share in the first quarter, a key measure for REIT investors in examining the dividend\u2019s safety.\n\nIts robust $4.08 FFO per share comfortably outpaces its quarterly dividend, indicating strong coverage. Additionally, Public Storage showcased strong growth, with its FFO and revenues soaring by 11.8% and 12.4% year-over-year, respectively, in the first quarter of 2023. This pattern points to a healthy financial trajectory for this REIT. Moreover, its 4-year average dividend yield is at an extraordinary 4.1%, backed by industry-leading growth numbers. Additionally, analysts at TipRanks rated the stock as a Moderate Buy with about a 9% upside from current levels.\n\nNorthrop Grumman (NOC) Northrop Grumman (NOC) logo on a corporate building\n\nSource: Kristi Blokhin / Shutterstock.com\n\nNorthrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) is arguably one of the best defense contractors known for its steady and dependable dividend payout. It channeled over 70% of its free cash flow into dividends last year, a testament to its shareholder commitment.\n\nThe company has effectively surpassed first-quarter expectations despite some turbulence, as evidenced by profit declines across key business units such as mission and aeronautics systems. It reported earnings per share of $5.50 on revenue of $9.3 billion, beating out the forecasted $5.09 on $9.2 billion. Particularly, its space unit offers a ray of optimism, with first-quarter sales skyrocketing 17% year-over-year. Impressively, its revenue eclipses that of the aeronautics division by over 35%.\n\nNOC stock is down almost 16% year-to-date, offering a powerful dividend yield of 1.7%, with consecutive dividend growth for almost 20 years.\n\nAgnico Eagle Mines (AEM) gold mining\n\nSource: \u00a9iStock.com/TomasSereda\n\nRising above cost and workforce challenges, Agnico Eagle Mines (NYSE:AEM) posted robustly in the gold production sphere last year. Hailed as the third-largest gold producer globally, the firm effectively showcased strong cost control and strategic expansion projects, leading to record-breaking margins. Notably, Agnico Eagle has maintained its position in lucrative mining jurisdictions and witnessed significant production growth compared to its peers.\n\nMoreover, with an array of projects in the U.S. and Colombia lined up and aimed at augmenting its gold and silver production profile, the firm is set for long-term growth expansion ahead. While rising costs due to persistent inflation could be considered a risk, Agnico Eagle seems well-equipped to manage labor and other costs. Additionally, the company offers a healthy and sustainable dividend yield, exceeding the 3% mark for its shareholders. With minimal political risk and a low valuation, the stock emerges as an appealing buy.\n\nRestaurant Brands (QSR) Three young adult friends sit around a vintage restaurant booth eating hamburgers. image represents restaurant stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nRestaurant Brands (NYSE:QSR) boasts a robust global footprint, operating around 29,000 restaurants in over 100 countries. The company continues to demonstrate impressive financial health with encouraging numbers across both lines. Consolidated total revenues and adjusted EBITDA grew over 9.5% and nearly 11% for the first quarter year-over-year, comfortably outpacing sector averages. Moreover, it has been an excellent performer in the stock market in the past year, generating a total return of 56% compared to the S&P 500\u2019s of just 21%.\n\nFurthermore, in its first quarter, it reported a notable year-over-year increase in sales to $1.59 billion, alongside a net income of $277 million. The driving forces behind this success lie in the company\u2019s diverse brand portfolio and the massive scale at which it operates.\n\nHence, with its international presence and commitment to continuous operational improvements, QSR stock represents one of the best income stocks at this time. Additionally, it offers a 2.79% yield with seven years of consecutive payout growth.\n\nKellogg\u00a0(K) Kellogg's sign on their Canada's head office building in Mississauga\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn the world of consumer stocks, Kellogg (NYSE:K) has been somewhat static, with its stock dipping 5% over the last five years with only a modest increase of 2% in the past decade. That stagnation stems from limited growth in its traditional cereal business, which faces challenges due to changing consumer behaviors and increased competition.\n\nThe company wants to spin off its cereal business from its other faster-growing consumer products, particularly snack items. The business will split its high-growth sections into a new entity named \u201cKellanova,\u201d while rebranding its cereal branch as \u201cWK Kellogg Co.\u201d\n\nFor investors, this could present a strategic opportunity wager on K stock before the split at the end of 2023. Moreover, despite recent challenges, the company has maintained a solid track record of 18 consecutive years of dividend growth, yielding an appealing 3.5%.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Eisen highlights bank deposit trends and how it is being reflected in current bank earnings.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n- Big banks reporting Friday, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, they all delivered solid earnings. A strong showing in profits made it easy to forget the years earlier chaos. Our next guest says all signs from big banks point to a soft landing. But how will high interest rates weigh on banks, both big and small, in the months ahead?\n\nJoining us now is Ben Eisen, \"Wall Street Journal\" reporter. Ben, thanks so much for joining us this morning. All right, Ben.\n\nBEN EISEN: Thanks for having me.\n\n- Let's get right into it. Let's talk about these big banks. We had a guest on earlier who talked about this strength that we saw. You put out a report talking about just the picture that the banks are painting. What's the theme that you're seeing play out with regard to the reports that we've seen so far?\n\nBEN EISEN: So it's important to note that we've only had three of the big banks out of six that have disclosed their earnings so far. But what we saw on Friday was honestly pretty good, as far as what people were expecting. All of the three banks, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, and JPMorgan, they all beat estimates on profit and revenue.\n\nAnd when you kind of dug into the details a little bit, what you saw is that the money that they set aside for bad loans is really not that much. Their customers were borrowing. They were spending. And the economy kind of continued to hum along as shown kind of coursing through these banks. And that's despite some of the worst fears that people had.\n\nWhen you think about the economy, we've been talking for years about, are we going to have a soft landing or are we going to have a hard landing? Are we going to have a deep recession? And it's obviously we don't know what's going to happen. But as far as what the banks are seeing right now, it really hasn't been the kind of hard landing that we've seen. It points more towards the soft one.\n\n- And given that we've only had a few of the banks come out so far, Ben, do you expect to continue to hear that, particularly from, like, the regional banks when they start reporting?\n\nBEN EISEN: I think that's-- I think there will be a distinction between the big banks and the regional banks. You know, what we saw among the big banks is that-- some of what we saw during the financial during the crisis that we had earlier this year with deposits leaving banks, these regional banks, and those banks having to replace those deposits with higher cost funding, we did see that at the biggest banks to a smaller extent. It impacted them less. They have these more diversified big businesses where they can offset sort of higher deposit costs with other lines of business.\n\nNow, when you look at the regional banks, they sort of have less room to maneuver. These are banks that are more focused on taking deposits, making loans, investing in securities. So the higher interest rate-- the hit from higher interest rates is going to be more acute at these smaller banks in all likelihood.\n\nSo that may mean that a lot of these banks had to replace these deposits that left with higher cost funding. And when that happens, you know, that kind of directly hits profit. It narrows the net interest margin that they earn. So I think that's something to be on the lookout for.\n\nHow bad it will be? It's hard to say. And all banks are sort of faring differently, but, yeah, I don't think anyone expects the mid-sized banks to have as rosy earnings as the big banks have had.\n\nAnd the big banks have actually sort of benefited in some ways from the trouble that we've had with regional banks because when people took their deposits from SVB, for example, they brought them to JPMorgan and Wells and Bank of America. And so, you know, you've had sort of the haves and the have nots that we've seen over the course of the year.\n\n- Ben, speaking of the haves and the have, nots there's been some divergence, obviously, in share price. And you dig into this. But when we look at this as a basket, you look particularly at the KBW, NASDAQ bank index, it being down for the year. But that's different from the XLF. What does that tell you or what does that signal about the state of the banking sector?\n\nBEN EISEN: You definitely do see this kind of divergence that's playing out between the biggest banks and the regional banks that's playing out in their share prices.

Elsewhere, Chinese quarterly growth figures provide further evidence of the country's sputtering recovery from the pandemic. Plus, Microsoft signs a licensing agreement with PlayStation over the \"Call of Duty\" gaming franchise that could bring the tech giant's mega-merger with Activision Blizzard one step closer to completion.\n\n1. U.S. stock futures mixed\n\nU.S. stock futures were mixed on Monday as investors looked ahead to a busy week of corporate results and digested underwhelming economic growth data out of China.\n\nBy 05:06 ET (09:06 GMT), the Dow futures contract had lost 50 points or 0.14%, S&P futures slipped slightly by 2 points or 0.03%, and Nasdaq 100 futures edged up by 18 points or 0.11%.\n\nAll three of these indices ended Friday with weekly gains of over 2%, driven in part by softer-than-expected inflation data for June that boosted hopes that the Federal Reserve may soon begin to step away from its recent policy tightening campaign. Traders also had a chance to parse through earnings from several major banks, including the biggest U.S. lender JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM).\n\nMeanwhile, sentiment heading into U.S. dealmaking was dented by data out of China that showed that growth in the world's second-largest economy had slowed substantially in the second quarter (see below).\n\n2. Second-quarter earnings season kicks into gear\n\nThe earnings calendar on Monday will be relatively light compared to the parade of companies due to deliver their latest results this week.\n\nBig financial industry players Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) are all scheduled to unveil quarterly earnings in the coming days. Bank balance sheets have come under heavy scrutiny in the wake of the failure of several regional rivals earlier this year, an event that plunged the financial services industry into crisis.\n\nOn Friday, lenders JPMorgan and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) posted surges in year-on-year net income, although peer Citigroup's (NYSE:C) profit tumbled by over a third. Collectively, net interest income, the difference between what a bank earns for loans and loses from deposits, at the three groups rose 30%, boosted by a spike in interest rates.\n\nElsewhere this week, Elon Musk-led electric carmaker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), streaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), and carrier United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) are among the key businesses to report.\n\n3. Chinese economic growth cools\n\nThe Chinese economy expanded at a much slower rate in the second quarter, casting further doubt over the country's nascent rebound from draconian pandemic-era restrictions.\n\nChina's second-quarter gross domestic product increased by 0.8% from the prior three-month period, slightly above expectations for an uptick of 0.5%, but cooling significantly from 2.2% in the first quarter.\n\nOn an annualized basis, GDP expanded by 6.3% thanks largely to a lower basis for comparison from the corresponding COVID-hit quarter last year. But this reading missed estimates for growth of 7.3%.\n\nFaltering property sector, sputtering exports, and weak retail sales have combined to weigh on an economic recovery in China that had seemed to be gathering momentum at the beginning of 2023.\n\n4. Microsoft signs \"Call of Duty\" licensing agreement with Sony\n\nMicrosoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) contentious push to acquire Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) received a major boost over the weekend when the tech giant agreed to keep the mega-popular gaming franchise \"Call of Duty\" on Sony's (TYO:6758) PlayStation console.\n\nThe deal helps overcome a key hurdle facing Microsoft's $69 billion purchase of Activision, which would be the biggest in the history of the video gaming industry. Shares in Activision surged by more than 4% in premarket trading on Monday.\n\nSony (NYSE:SONY) has previously stood in opposition to the tie-up, arguing that Microsoft will use it to in effect prevent access to lucrative titles like action shooter \"Call of Duty\" to PlayStation.\n\nThe announcement comes after U.S. antitrust regulators, who have voiced concerns over lessening competition, had multiple attempts to prevent the merger from closing rejected by a federal court in San Francisco last week.\n\nThe decision in turn led the U.K.'s competition watchdog, which had blocked the deal in April, to offer Microsoft and Activision a new chance to remedy their worries.\n\n5. Oil volatile in the wake of Chinese data, Russian grain deal uncertainty\n\nOil prices moved lower in choppy trading on Monday, with traders gauging the health of demand in the top crude importer China and uncertainty around the West's response to Russia withdrawing from a U.N.-brokered Black Sea grain deal.\n\nMeanwhile, two of the three Libyan oil fields that were shut down on Thursday resumed production over the weekend, adding supply to the global market.\n\nBy 05:31 ET, the U.S. crude futures traded 1.25% lower at $74.38 a barrel, while the Brent contract shed 1.09% to $79.00 per barrel.\n\nBoth benchmarks recorded a third straight week of gains last week, touching their highest levels since April. Some support came from slower-than-expected U.S. inflation data as well as anticipated output cuts by Saudi Arabia and Russia later this summer.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nU.S. corporate earnings ahead, Chinese GDP underwhelms - what's moving markets\n\nNigeria inflation up slightly to 22.79% y/y in June\n\nIs the wild ride over?

Meanwhile, oil prices look poised for another weekly gain.\n\n1. Earnings time\n\nSecond-quarter earnings season gets underway in earnest in the coming week, with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) the first of the massive growth and technology names that have dominated the U.S. stock market so far this year to report, with results expected on Wednesday.\n\nTesla is one of seven huge stocks, along with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) recently dubbed the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d by investors. Shares in the megacaps have soared between 40% and over 200% so far this year, accounting for almost all of the S&P 500\u2019s rally.\n\nThere are indications the rally is broadening to other sectors, but the outsize gains have come with big earnings expectations so if Tesla or any other megacaps disappoint this quarter, the hit to equity indexes could be severe.\n\nA slew of other big companies also post results in the coming week. Bank earnings continue, with Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) on Tuesday and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) on Wednesday. Also on the docket are Johnson&Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Philip Morris (NYSE:PM).\n\n2. U.S. economic data\n\nU.S. retail sales data for June on Tuesday is expected to show an increase of 0.5%, boosted by rebounding auto sales and higher gasoline station sales, indicating that consumer demand remains resilient.\n\nInvestors will also get an update on the health of the housing sector with reports on building permits, housing starts and existing home sales. High mortgage rates are still weighing on sales of existing homes, but construction is improving given stable pricing and a pick-up in new home sales due to the lack of properties on the market.\n\nThere will also be reports on regionalmanufacturing activity, which is expected to remain sluggish along with the weekly data on initial jobless claims.\n\n3. China economic data\n\nA flurry of economic data from China on Monday is expected to show its post-pandemic bounce is rapidly losing momentum, fueling expectations that Beijing will soon need to unveil more stimulus measures.\n\nGross domestic product is expected to have grown by an annualized 7.3% in the three months to June, compared with growth of 4.5% in the first quarter.\n\nHowever, that reading will be heavily skewed by a sharp slump in activity in the spring, when large parts of the country were still locked down.\n\nMounting deflationary pressure and a slump in trade have added to concerns over the outlook for the world\u2019s second-largest economy, which as recently as six months ago had investors betting on a robust recovery.\n\n4. U.K. inflation\n\nThe U.K. is to release June inflation data on Wednesday and investors will be watching closely as it will likely determine the size of the Bank of England\u2019s next rate hike.\n\nThe headline consumer price index is expected to ease to 8.2% year-over-year from 8.7% in May as food and fuel prices dip. Core inflation is also expected to edge lower, but the services component is expected to hold steady at a post-COVID high of 7.4%.\n\nIn its June meeting minutes the BoE said further tightening would be required if there were signs of persistent inflationary pressures in the economy, including in services CPI.\n\nThis could make August\u2019s meeting a close call: an uptick in services CPI would probably lock in bets for another 50-basis point hike, while a lower reading would probably nudge the dial in favor of a smaller 25 bps increase.\n\n5. Oil prices\n\nOil prices recorded their third-straight weekly gain last week and the rally could resume in the coming week as easing inflation, plans to refill the U.S. strategic reserve, supply cuts and disruptions underpin prices.\n\n\"While oil prices are likely slightly overbought in the very near term, touching the highest levels since early May, the bias appears to be for a grind higher,\" Rob Haworth, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management told Reuters.\n\nOil prices gained nearly 2% last week, after supply disruptions in Libya and Nigeria heightened concerns that the markets will tighten in coming months.\n\nOil prices fell more than a dollar a barrel on Friday as the dollar strengthened and oil traders booked profits from a strong rally.\n\n--Reuters contributed to this report\n\nRelated Articles\n\nTop 5 things to watch in markets in the week ahead\n\nTrans-Pacific trade pact members gathering information on aspiring joiners\n\nExclusive-India to push G20 to raise share of taxes on firms where they earn 'excess profit' - sources", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-5-things-watch-markets-062613325.html", "symbols": ["AAPL.US", "AMZN.US", "BAC.US", "GOOGL.US", "GS.US", "JNJ.US", "META.US", "MSFT.US", "NFLX.US", "NVDA.US", "PM.US", "TL0.F", "TL0.XETRA", "TSLA.MX", "TSLA.US", "TSLA34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.98, "neg": 0.059, "neu": 0.847, "pos": 0.094}}]
