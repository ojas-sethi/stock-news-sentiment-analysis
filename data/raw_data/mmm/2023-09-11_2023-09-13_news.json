There has not been a single decade over the last 93 years where dividend-paying stocks on the S&P 500 did not outperform non-dividend stocks.\n\nMore recently, JPMorgan Chase found stocks that initiated and then raised their payouts over the 40-year period between 1972 and 2012 returned an average of 9.5% annually, versus just 1.6% non-dividend-paying stocks.\n\nThat\u2019s why you should buy Dividend Aristocrats. These are stocks that are part of the S&P 500 that have raised their dividends every single year for at least 25 years. It\u2019s a surprisingly select group of companies. Only 67 stocks make the cut. Simply chasing yield is a dangerous pursuit since a higher yield often entails higher risk. So, ideally, you want to balance the yield with risk. Fortunately, Dividend Aristocrats tend to do that, even if it\u2019s not a foolproof strategy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFor example, AT&T was booted from the list last year after cutting its payout in half following the spinoff of its Warner Media business. The deal, though, actually strengthened the telecom\u2019s remaining dividend payment and may give AT&T a chance to grow again.\n\nSo let\u2019s look at each of these high-yielding Dividend Aristocrats.\n\nDividend Aristocrats: International Business Machines (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\n\nIBM (NYSE:IBM) is a highly profitable business that essentially created the information technology industry. Yet it has been too late to recognize today\u2019s leading tech trends. For example, it missed the transition to cloud computing and scrambled to become a hybrid cloud company offering both physical and cloud-based solutions. There\u2019s potential in the field, but IBM is not the leader.\n\nIn fact, a lot of IBM\u2019s offerings reek of a \u201cme too\u201d strategy. It gloms onto whatever is popular at the moment without putting any distinctive IBM imprimatur on it. But its operations do throw off a lot of cash. Trailing 12-month free cash flow stands at $10.3 billion. While that\u2019s less than a few years ago, it\u2019s more than in 2022, and it handily supports its dividend that yields 4.5% annually. IBM has increased its dividend for 30 straight years.\n\nStory continues\n\nFranklin Resources (BEN) A photo of a young boy wearing sunglasses, jeans, a blazer, a white shirt and suspenders holding money in various denominations in one hand and sitting in a plush chair.\n\nSource: Dmitry Lobanov/Shutterstock.com\n\nBest known as the owner of\u00a0 Franklin Templeton, one of the world\u2019s largest investment managers with $1.4 trillion in assets under management (AUM), Franklin Resources (NYSE:BEN) is benefiting from an improving market. AUM increased in the latest period while outflows stabilized and remained flat.\n\nThe asset manager suffered from strong long-term net outflows earlier this year as consumer confidence in the economy wavered. Since much of Franklin\u2019s revenue is dependent upon investment management fees, market volatility can work for the company as well as against it. A heady feeling amongst investors gets them to put money into the market, boosting AUM. Angst over the economy\u2019s direction has them pulling money out. But bull markets always follow bears, and the long-term directory for this premiere asset manager is up.\n\nFranklin Resources is seeking new lines of business to diversify. It recently acquired a retirement asset business; a credit and private debt manager; and additional real estate, private credit, and hedge fund lines. The firm has raised its dividend for 41 years and counting. The payout yields 4.6% annually.\n\nAmcor (AMCR) sheet of paper marked \"dividends\" with a $20 bill on top of it to represent dividend stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThere\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ve never heard of Amcor (NYSE:AMCR). Involved in the packaging industry for food, beverages, pharmaceuticals, and personal care products, its business is suffering as a result of persistent high inflation and continued rising food costs. Consumers are not buying the same kinds of foods they were previously. Or, they\u2019re cutting back, as pocketbooks are hit hard.\n\nAmcor is being hit with high raw material costs as well. That led the packaging expert to raise prices where it could to offset the impact. It resulted in growing adjusted operating earnings for the year. The company has been through these business cycles before and weathered them just fine. Its dividend is stellar too. Amcor has raised its dividend for 40 consecutive years and yields 5.4%. Over the past three years, the payout has risen at an average rate of 27% annually.\n\nRealty Income (O) realty income logo highlighted by a magnifying glass on a web browser\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nReal estate investment trust Realty Income (NYSE:O) is a unique Dividend Aristocrat in that it makes its payout monthly. In fact, it dubbed itself \u201cThe Monthly Dividend Company.\u201d It\u2019s not the only REIT to pay dividends every 30 days, but it\u2019s done it the longest. Better, the REIT has now declared 638 consecutive monthly dividends and increased the payout 121 times. The dividend yields 5.6%.\n\nIt owns more than 13,100 real estate properties. The commercial tenants occupying its space do so under long-term net lease agreements. It also just agreed to buy Blackstone\u2018s 22% stake in the Bellagio casino in Las Vegas for $300 million. Realty Income will also contribute $650 million in preferred equity into the venture with Blackstone. Las Vegas is making a strong comeback and Realty Income\u2019s investment should help it benefit from the new relationship.\n\n3M (MMM) 3M logo on top of a corporate building. MMM stock\n\nSource: JPstock / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlthough 3M (NYSE:MMM) was well-known previously for products like Post-It Notes and Scotch brand tape, the industrial conglomerate really gained consumer mindshare during the pandemic. Everyone wanted one of its N95 masks for protection and they were in short supply.\n\nWith the situation normalized once more, 3M\u2019s stock is now under pressure from potential legal liabilities related to contaminated drinking water and faulty earplugs for the military that were manufactured by a company it acquired. It agreed to pay out $10.3 billion for the so-called \u201cforever chemicals\u201d found in the water, and it has set aside up to $1 billion for claims on the earplugs. Some analysts, though, think that might not be nearly enough.\n\nDespite the headwinds, 3M remains exceedingly profitable. Earnings in the second quarter took a hit because of the one-time charges related to the settlement, but it was still able to report adjusted profits of $2.17 per share. While that was down 12% year over year, it includes pre-tax restructuring charges of $0.31 per share.\n\n3M also returned $828 million to shareholders through dividends. The conglomerate has raised its dividend for 66 years running. It yields 5.6% annually.\n\nLeggett & Platt (LEG) dividend stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nLike Amcor, many investors may not be familiar with Leggett & Platt (NYSE:LEG) even though they may use its products every day. It\u2019s one of the leading manufacturers of innerspring coils for mattresses and sofas. Leggett & Platt also makes \u200b\u200bmechanical and lumbar support for car seats, steel mechanisms and motion hardware for chairs, and synthetic fabrics for ground stabilization, drainage protection, erosion, and weed control.\n\nWith the housing and auto industries in a weakened state, the diversified manufacturer took a hit to sales. Consumer demand for mattresses, furniture, and flooring were all much less than anticipated in the second quarter resulting in sales falling 8% from last year. It should be noted that last year\u2019s earnings saw sales hit a record $1.33 billion for the period.\n\nLeggett & Platt lowered full-year guidance because of volatility in the marketplace. It also said it did not have much visibility into how long these conditions will last. Housing doesn\u2019t look like it will turn around anytime soon, but the auto industry is seeing some improvement. New car sales surged 15% higher in August compared to last year. Aerospace and hydraulic cylinder segments are also enjoying growth, but they comprise the two smallest businesses Leggett & Pratt operates.\n\nHowever, investors are sustained by its dividend, which currently yields 6.9%. It\u2019s paid a dividend every year since 1939 and raised it for 52 years straight (also making it a Dividend King).\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) Walgreens (WBA) store exterior and sign in Pompano Beach, Florida\n\nSource: saaton / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe Dividend Aristocrat with the highest dividend yield is Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) at 8.7% as compared to the S&P 500\u2019s 1.5% yield. But Walgreens did something notable this past July that it hasn\u2019t done in the past 47 years: it didn\u2019t raise the payout.\n\nThe company\u2019s stated policy is \u201cto increase its dividend each year.\u201d It even points out it has made a payment every quarter since 1933. The inaction indicates the pharmacy chain is hurting. In fact, the CEO quit to kick off September.\n\nTechnically, Walgreens just needs to pay out more dividends per share from one year to the next to continue qualifying as a Dividend Aristocrat. That means there is still time to raise it. That it didn\u2019t do so when it normally does is telling. As I said before, Dividend Aristocrats tend to keep raising their payouts, but not always.\n\nSales were up 9% in the fiscal third quarter and adjusted profits rose 3%. However, declining demand for Covid vaccines caused a 20% headwind. President Biden is requesting funding for a new and improved vaccine, but the public may not line up to take yet another booster shot. Officials, though, want people taking one at least every year.\n\nTo contain costs now, Walgreens is targeting $4.1 billion in annual cost savings by the end of fiscal 2024. It is also expanding its focus beyond its pharmacies, moving into primary, specialty, and urgent care. A bet now on Walgreens Boots Alliance is one that sees the pharmacy chain turning it around.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a LONG position in T, BEN, AMCR, O, MMM, LEG, and WBA stock.

This has outpaced the Conglomerates sector's loss of 2.42% and the S&P 500's loss of 0.73% in that time.\n\n3M will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. On that day, 3M is projected to report earnings of $2.36 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 12.27%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $8.02 billion, down 6.91% from the year-ago period.\n\nMMM's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $8.95 per share and revenue of $32.04 billion.

These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.\n\nBased on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 10 Most Dangerous Jobs in the World.\n\nWhile we live in a world where safety often takes the forefront of our priorities, there remain jobs that defy the norm. These exist some of the deadliest jobs, where every day on the job is a high-stakes gamble with life and limb. From firefighters battling towering infernos to deep-sea fishermen confronting the unforgiving oceans, some jobs require individuals to play with dangers every now and then. This puts organizations and companies to the test that must ensure safety precautions for their workers and thus, observe no negligence.\n\nHistorical Evidence of How Negligence Costed Workers\u2019 Lives at Workplaces\n\nOne of the most notorious instances of corporate negligence that resulted in worker fatalities occurred at the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory in New York City. The factory's owners, Max Blanck and Isaac Harris, prioritized profit over the well-being of their workers which eventually led to a catastrophic loss of life on March 25, 1911. The absence of adequate fire escapes and extinguishing equipment left the predominantly young immigrant women employees in a dire situation when a fire erupted on the eighth floor.\n\nWith locked exits and stairwells, they were trapped in a burning building which rendered escape impossible for many. As a result, 146 lives, mostly those of Italian and Jewish immigrant women and girls aged 14 to 23, were lost. The absence of proper safety measures not only contributed to the high casualty count but also highlighted the callous disregard for worker safety during that era. However, it is worth mentioning how this horrific incident catalyzed significant changes in labor laws and regulations while emphasizing the critical importance of workplace safety standards to protect workers from such avoidable catastrophes.\n\nIn addition, the Bhopal Gas Tragedy in India remains one of the most devastating industrial disasters in history. Union Carbide, an American chemical company, operated a pesticide plant in Bhopal. Negligence in maintaining safety standards, poor equipment maintenance, and inadequate employee training contributed to a massive gas leak of methyl isocyanate on December 2, 1984. Thousands died, and many suffered lifelong health issues as a result. In this case, the company's negligence and delayed response have pushed the global urgency to realize the need for stringent safety measures and corporate accountability.\n\nStory continues\n\nCompanies Committed to Worker Safety\n\nWhile there has been an irresponsible attitude toward workers' safety by corporations around the world, there are some names that have always been at the forefront of addressing the safety concerns of their employees. 3M Co (NYSE:MMM) cares for worker safety by producing an extensive range of safety products that include N95 respirators, ear protection, innovative fall protection gear, and reflective materials to improve visibility for workers.\n\nTransitioning to their financial performance in the second quarter of 2023, 3M Co (NYSE:MMM) reported adjusted earnings of $2.17 per share and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate despite a double-digit decline year over year. This decrease can be attributed to pre-tax restructuring charges of $212 million. On the revenue front, 3M Co (NYSE:MMM)\u2019's quarterly net sales of $8,325 million exceeded expectations but still with a 4.3% year-over-year decline. Regionally, the Americas experienced a 1.5% decline in sales, while the Asia Pacific region saw a 12.8% decrease. Sales from Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, on the other hand, observed a modest increase of 0.6%.\n\nLike 3M Co (NYSE:MMM), Honeywell International Inc (NASDAQ:HON) is also dedicated to ensuring worker safety through their comprehensive range of services and products. They not only provide the right Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) but also educate workers on its proper usage. Honeywell Safety Services offers expert guidance by conducting assessments and training to help employees understand the most suitable PPE for their specific work environments and associated hazards.\n\nHoneywell International Inc (NASDAQ:HON)\u2019s safety measures for their employees extend to real-time monitoring solutions for gas detection management to offer support, calibration assistance, device repairs, and troubleshooting. Their extensive safety training programs educate thousands of workers on-site, at customer locations, and in training centers. With a focus on individualized hearing conservation programs, Honeywell International Inc (NASDAQ:HON) takes worker safety to the edge, as they recognize how each worker's safety needs are unique.\n\nEnsuring workers' safety is one of the integral aspects of a company's ESG indicators. Socially conscious investors have been paying increasing attention to how companies have been improving their ESG indicators. Many, however, still question whether ESG-based investments are financially rewarding. In this regard, Stern School of Business did a meta-analysis of a 1,000 studies on ESG, carried out between 2015-2020, and arrived at the conclusion that the correlation between ESG and corporate financial performance was positive and statistically significant for 58% of the studies. 26 Most Dangerous Jobs in the World\n\nNestor Rizhniak/Shutterstock.com\n\nMethodology\n\nTo determine the most dangerous jobs in the world, we acquired data of Fatal Injury Rate per 100,000 people from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries. The list is presented in ascending order.\n\nIn case of similar fatal injury rates, the job with higher total fatalities in 2019 was ranked higher. For data on total fatalities in 2019, we acquired our data from Advisorsmith.\n\nImportant Note: Please note that our list does not include any military or security contractor jobs despite the perceived relatively high-risk nature of these jobs.

Growth in the auto OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) business should aid the Transportation and Electronics segment. Organic sales growth in the medical solutions and oral care business is benefiting the Healthcare segment, while muted growth in home, health and auto care should aid the Consumer unit. With improving supply chains, the company anticipates improvements in organic growth, operating margins, earnings and cash flow in due course of the year.\r\n\r\nRestructuring Actions: 3M is undertaking restructuring actions to reduce costs and improve margins and cash flow in the long term. The organizational restructuring has impacted approximately 6,000 positions globally. This is in addition to the reduction of 2,500 global manufacturing roles announced this January. MMM expects these actions to yield annual pre-tax savings of $700 million-$900 million, approximately half of which is expected to be realized in 2023. The company\u2019s pricing actions (to mitigate the adverse impact of raw material and logistics cost inflation), restructuring savings and spending discipline should support its margins.\r\n\r\nRewards to Shareholders: 3M is committed to rewarding its shareholders handsomely through dividend payments and share buybacks. In the first half of 2023, MMM rewarded its shareholders with $1,655 million in dividend payments and $29 million in buybacks. Strong free cash flow generation supports its shareholder-friendly measures. Adjusted free cash flow at the end of the second quarter was $2409 million, up 35.3% year over year. The company anticipates an adjusted operating cash flow of $5.9-$6.3 billion for 2023. In February 2023, MMM hiked its quarterly dividend by 0.7% to $1.50 per share.\n\nStory continues\n\n3M Company Price and Consensus 3M Company Price and Consensus\n\n3M Company price-consensus-chart | 3M Company Quote\n\nPortfolio Reshaping Actions: 3M\u2019s portfolio reshaping actions are expected to enhance its shareholder value over time.
