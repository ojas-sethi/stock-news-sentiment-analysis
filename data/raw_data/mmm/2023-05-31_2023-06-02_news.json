This company\u2019s bellwether status and an optimal integrated capital structure that has historically produced industry-leading returns make it a relatively lower-risk energy sector play. The firm has made more than 30 discoveries in offshore Guyana since 2015.\r\n\r\nExxonMobil also has a strong presence in the Permian Basin, the most prolific resource in the United States. It recently reported strong first-quarter earnings, thanks to solid contributions from the Energy Products business line. This was offset partially by lower earnings from upstream operations.\r\n\r\nAlso, weak industry margins and lower sales from the Chemical Products business line are hurting the energy major\u2019s operations. Moreover, the integrated firm\u2019s dividend yield is lower than the composite stocks belonging to the industry.

The company is expected to continue dominating the, courtesy of its diversified content portfolio, which is attributable to heavy investments in the production and distribution of localized, foreign-language content.\r\n\r\nHowever, Netflix is suffering from stiff competition in the streaming space from the likes of Apple, Amazon Prime Video, HBO Max, Disney+, Peacock, Paramount+ and TikTok. It launched paid sharing in four countries during the first quarter.\r\n\r\nAlthough it witnessed cancellations at the initial stage of the launch, engagement gradually improved.

In April, BMO Capital kept its Outperform rating on the stock with a $90 price target, presenting a neutral stance on the company's performance in the upcoming quarters.\n\nNextEra Energy, Inc.

It is among the best dividend aristocrat stocks on our list.\n\nWarren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway was the leading stakeholder of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) with 400 million shares at the end of Q1 2023. Overall, 61 hedge funds in Insider Monkey's database owned stakes in the company, with a collective value of over $24.8 billion.\n\nHere is what Rown Street had to say about The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let\u2019s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).\u201d\n\n12.

PFAS have been used for decades in products ranging from nonstick pans to cosmetics, but they don\u2019t break down naturally and can settle in soil, water or human bodies.\n\nStuart, Florida, the plaintiff in the trial, is suing 3M over a PFAS-containing foam used by firefighting crews across the US to suppress fuel fires. The city claims 3M failed to warn of PFAS\u2019s risks and designed defective products. A verdict for Stuart could help determine what 3M must pay to settle other cases.\n\nLawyers for Stuart are seeking $105 million to cover the cost of removing PFAS and as much as $500 million in punitive damages, court filings show.\n\nFinancial research firm CreditSights estimates that 3M could ultimately be on the hook for nationwide PFAS cleanup costs of up to $142.7 billion. That\u2019s almost triple the company\u2019s $53 billion market capitalization, and that\u2019s before any personal injury claims and other lawsuits.\n\nUS District Judge Richard Gergel, who\u2019s overseeing the Stuart case and thousand of others, said at a 2019 hearing that the litigation poses an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to 3M and other companies that manufactured PFAS, like DuPont de Nemours Inc., its spinoff Chemours Co., and Chemguard Inc. Gergel severed DuPont from the Stuart case, leaving 3M as the only defendant.\n\n\u201cThey may not be able to settle their way out of this,\u201d said Chuck Tatelbaum, a bankruptcy lawyer who has dealt with mass-tort cases. \u201cBankruptcy may be the only real alternative to deal with this kind of bet-the-company threat.\u201d\n\nDisputed Findings\n\nSt. Paul, Minnesota-based 3M maintains that PFAS are safe and that PFAS contamination poses no significant threat to public health and welfare. The EPA says PFAS are linked to developmental delays in children and increased cancer risks, and some researchers have linked PFAS to specific cancers, but 3M disputes those findings.\n\n3M has said it will stop making the chemicals by 2025 because of \u201cregulatory trends focused on reducing or eliminating the presence of PFAS in the environment.\u201d The company started winding down production of some of the compounds in 2000, court filings show.\n\nIn a statement, a 3M spokesman said the company would contest claims by cities, states and individuals but also held out the possibility of settlement. \u201cWe are in active, ongoing and confidential mediation sessions regarding the resolution\u201d of the Stuart case and \u201cmultiple other water supplier cases and claims,\u201d he said.\n\nThe company settled another PFAS lawsuit on the eve of trial in 2018, agreeing to pay $850 million to resolve claims by Minnesota\u2019s attorney general that the chemicals damaged drinking water and natural resources. 3M admitted no wrongdoing. Earlier this week, 3M, DuPont and other companies agreed to pay more than $100 million to settle a PFAS suit by the city of Rome, Georgia.\n\nRead More: 3M, DuPont to Pay $100 Million to End Georgia PFAS Suit\n\nGary Douglas and Wes Bowden, two lawyers for Stuart, declined to comment on the possibility of a settlement. \u201cWe look forward to presenting our case to the jury and seeking justice for our client,\u201d they said in a statement.\n\nCarl Tobias, a University of Richmond professor who teaches product-liability law, said a settlement would make sense for 3M. \u201cI think any jury that actually gets to hear the case against the makers of PFAS is likely to come back with a huge verdict against them,\u201d he said.\n\nThe firefighting foam at issue in the Stuart case often runs off into water sources during training exercises, according to court filings. According to court filings, tests on some Stuart wells in 2021 found PFAS levels at 1,600 parts per trillion. The US Environmental Protection Agency in March proposed a nationwide cap on two of the most widely used and studied PFAS compounds \u2014 PFOA and PFOS \u2014 at 4 parts per trillion.\n\n\u2018Uninvestible\u2019\n\nPotential PFAS liability prompted Kidde-Fenwal Inc. \u2014 a distributor of firefighting foam that never made the substance \u2013 to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in May.\n\nIf 3M does file for bankruptcy to manage its legal exposure, it wouldn\u2019t be the first time. A 3M unit is currently in bankruptcy protection while it tries to resolve more than 230,000 lawsuits by soldiers over allegedly faulty ear protection sold to the US military.\n\nThe litigation risks have already taken a toll with investors. Shares have declined by about 60% since their high in January 2018, in part due to liability concerns, erasing about $100 billion in market value.\n\n\u201cI get calls all the time asking \u2018what inning are we in with this?\u2019 We\u2019re still in spring training,\u201d RBC Capital Markets analyst Deane Dray said about the litigation. \u201cIt renders the stock uninvestible.\u201d\n\nThe case is Aqueous Film-Forming Foams Products Liability Litigation, No. 18-mn-2873, US District Court, District of South Carolina (Charleston).\n\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3m-heads-trial-existential-143-110000116.html", "symbols": ["6D81.F", "DD.BA", "DD.US", "DDNB34.SA", "MMM.F", "MMM.MX", "MMM.US", "MMM.XETRA", "MMMC34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": -0.99, "neg": 0.11, "neu": 0.825, "pos": 0.065}}, {"date": "2023-06-01T21:45:20+00:00", "title": "3M (MMM) Outpaces Stock Market Gains: What You Should Know", "content": "3M (MMM) closed at $94.28 in the latest trading session, marking a +1.04% move from the prior day.

The company is expected to report EPS of $1.74, down 29.84% from the prior-year quarter. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $7.81 billion, down 10.2% from the year-ago period.\n\nMMM's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $8.66 per share and revenue of $32.09 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of -14.26% and -6.25%, respectively.\n\nIt is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for 3M. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.\n\nResearch indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

This valuation marks a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 14.83.\n\nAlso, we should mention that MMM has a PEG ratio of 1.13. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. The Diversified Operations industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 1.67 as of yesterday's close.\n\nThe Diversified Operations industry is part of the Conglomerates sector.

The city sued the companies in Floyd County Superior Court over PFAS were used as stain-proofing agents in carpeting produced in local plants. The settlement comes on the eve of trial in the case, which had been scheduled to begin Monday.\n\nThe city was seeking to recoup nearly $100 million it spent building a reverse-osmosis system to clear the chemicals from the Oostanaula and Etowah Rivers. The city sought more than $300 million in damages over the pollution, according to court filings.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency has said PFAS can cause developmental delays in children and increase cancer risks. But the companies dispute those findings and maintain that PFAS are safe.\n\nSean Lynch, a spokesman for St. Paul, Minnesota\u2013based 3M, confirmed the manufacturer had reached a deal in the Rome case. \u201c3M has reached an agreement on the principal terms of a settlement,\u201d Lynch said in an emailed statement. \u201cWe will continue to fulfill our PFAS remediation commitments and address litigation by defending ourselves in court or through negotiated resolutions, all as appropriate.\u201d\n\nDan Turner, a DuPont spokesman, also confirmed the manufacturer participated in the confidential settlements, but wouldn\u2019t comment on the amount.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this maker of Post-it notes, industrial coatings and ceramics have returned -6.7%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Diversified Operations industry, which 3M falls in, has lost 3.9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, 3M is expected to post earnings of $1.74 per share, indicating a change of -29.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.66 points to a change of -14.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.50 indicates a change of +9.7% from what 3M is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.7%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for 3M.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for MMM _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor 3M, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $7.81 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -10.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $32.09 billion and $33.28 billion estimates indicate -6.3% and +3.7% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\n3M reported revenues of $8.03 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -9%. EPS of $1.97 for the same period compares with $2.65 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.64 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.19%. The EPS surprise was +23.13%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, 3M surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\n3M is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about 3M. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
