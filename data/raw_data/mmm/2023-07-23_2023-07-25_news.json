MMM 30-Year Financial Data The intrinsic value of MMM\n\n3M Co has a GF Score of 84 out of 100, indicating good outperformance potential. The GF Score is a comprehensive measure of a company's financial performance, taking into account five key aspects: Financial Strength, Profitability Rank, Growth Rank, GF Value Rank, and Momentum Rank. A higher GF Score generally suggests higher returns, making 3M Co an attractive investment option. GF Score Analysis: A Deep Dive into 3M Co's Financial Performance\n\nFinancial Strength Analysis\n\n3M Co's Financial Strength Rank stands at 6 out of 10. This rank, provided by GuruFocus, measures the robustness of a company's financial situation. It takes into account the company's debt burden, debt to revenue ratio, and Altman Z-Score.

The company's Altman Z-Score of 3.81 further indicates financial stability.\n\nProfitability Rank Analysis\n\nThe company's Profitability Rank is 9 out of 10, suggesting high profitability.

The company has also maintained consistent profitability over the past 10 years.\n\nGrowth Rank Analysis\n\n3M Co's Growth Rank is 6 out of 10, indicating moderate growth prospects. The Growth Rank measures a company's growth in terms of revenue and profitability.

The company's market cap stands at $60.6 billion, with sales amounting to $33.4 billion. However, according to the GF Value, the stock's fair value is estimated at $168.61, indicating that 3M Co is significantly undervalued. This valuation is based on crucial factors such as historical trading multiples, an adjustment factor from GuruFocus based on past performance and growth, and estimates of future business performance.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with MMM. Click here to check it out.  MMM 30-Year Financial Data The intrinsic value of MMM\n\n3M Co, also known as Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, is a multinational conglomerate with operations since 1902. The company is renowned for its research and development laboratory, leveraging its science and technology across multiple product categories. As of 2020, 3M Co is organized into four business segments: safety and industrial, transportation and electronics, healthcare, and consumer. Nearly 50% of the company's revenue comes from outside the Americas, with the safety and industrial segment constituting a plurality of net sales.\n\nGF Value of 3M Co\n\nAccording to GuruFocus' valuation method, the stock of 3M Co is significantly undervalued. The GF Value estimates the stock's fair value based on historical multiples, an internal adjustment based on the company's past business growth, and analyst estimates of future business performance. If the share price is significantly above the GF Value Line, the stock may be overvalued and have poor future returns. Conversely, if the share price is significantly below the GF Value calculation, the stock may be undervalued and have higher future returns. Given its current price of $109.89 per share, 3M Co stock is believed to be significantly undervalued.\n\nBecause 3M Co is significantly undervalued, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be much higher than its business growth. 3M Co (MMM): A Significantly Undervalued Gem in the Market\n\nLink: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.\n\nFinancial Strength of 3M Co\n\nCompanies with poor financial strength offer investors a high risk of permanent capital loss. To avoid permanent capital loss, an investor must do their research and review a companys financial strength before deciding to purchase shares. Both the cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage of a company are a great way to understand its financial strength. 3M Co has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.24, which ranks worse than 65.92% of companies in the Conglomerates industry. The overall financial strength of 3M Co is 6 out of 10, indicating fair financial strength. 3M Co (MMM): A Significantly Undervalued Gem in the Market\n\nProfitability of 3M Co\n\nIt is less risky to invest in profitable companies, especially those with consistent profitability over the long term. A company with high profit margins is usually a safer investment than those with low profit margins. 3M Co has been profitable 10 over the past 10 years. Over the past twelve months, the company had a revenue of $33.4 billion and Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $9.65. Its operating margin is 11.86%, which ranks better than 76.4% of companies in the Conglomerates industry. Overall, the profitability of 3M Co is ranked 9 out of 10, indicating strong profitability.\n\nGrowth of 3M Co\n\nGrowth is probably the most important factor in the valuation of a company. A faster growing company creates more value for shareholders, especially if the growth is profitable. The 3-year average annual revenue growth of 3M Co is 3.2%, which ranks worse than 55.14% of companies in the Conglomerates industry. The 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 5.2%, which ranks worse than 61.52% of companies in the Conglomerates industry.\n\nROIC vs WACC of 3M Co\n\nAnother way to evaluate a companys profitability is to compare its return on invested capital (ROIC) to its weighted cost of capital (WACC). Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. If the ROIC is higher than the WACC, it indicates that the company is creating value for shareholders. Over the past 12 months, 3M Cos ROIC was 9.44, while its WACC came in at 8. 3M Co (MMM): A Significantly Undervalued Gem in the Market\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the stock of 3M Co (NYSE:MMM) is believed to be significantly undervalued. The company's financial condition is fair and its profitability is strong. Its growth ranks worse than 61.52% of companies in the Conglomerates industry.

Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for 3M: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $2.42 on $8.08 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $8.73 on $32.11 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Diversified Operations is currently in the top 43% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nCarlisle (CSL), another stock in the same industry, has yet to report results for the quarter ended June 2023.

The company's stock saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock\u2019s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Today I will analyse the most recent data on 3M\u2019s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists.\n\nView our latest analysis for 3M\n\nWhat's The Opportunity In 3M?\n\nGood news, investors! 3M is still a bargain right now. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $134.53, but it is currently trading at US$104 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. Another thing to keep in mind is that 3M\u2019s share price may be quite stable relative to the rest of the market, as indicated by its low beta. This means that if you believe the current share price should move towards its intrinsic value over time, a low beta could suggest it is not likely to reach that level anytime soon, and once it\u2019s there, it may be hard to fall back down into an attractive buying range again.\n\nWhat kind of growth will 3M generate? earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nFuture outlook is an important aspect when you\u2019re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it\u2019s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Though in the case of 3M, it is expected to deliver a negative earnings growth of -1.5%, which doesn\u2019t help build up its investment thesis. It appears that risk of future uncertainty is high, at least in the near term.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? Although MMM is currently undervalued, the negative outlook does bring on some uncertainty, which equates to higher risk. Consider whether you want to increase your portfolio exposure to MMM, or whether diversifying into another stock may be a better move for your total risk and return.\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on MMM for a while, but hesitant on making the leap, I recommend you dig deeper into the stock. Given its current undervaluation, now is a great time to make a decision. But keep in mind the risks that come with negative growth prospects in the future.\n\nKeep in mind, when it comes to analysing a stock it's worth noting the risks involved.
