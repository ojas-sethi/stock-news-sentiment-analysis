GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with MMM.\n\nOn October 24, 2023, 3M Co (NYSE:MMM) released its third-quarter earnings report for 2023. Despite facing challenges, the company demonstrated strong operational execution, restructuring actions, and proactive spending discipline. The company's results reflect its continued execution of its priorities, including driving operational performance, spinning off Health Care, and reducing risk and uncertainty.\n\nFinancial Highlights\n\nThe company reported a GAAP loss per share of $3.74 and an operating margin of minus 31.9%, largely due to the previously announced settlement for Combat Arms, resulting in a pre-tax charge of $4.2 billion. However, the adjusted EPS of $2.68, which includes pre-tax restructuring-related charges of $68 million, was up 3 percent year-on-year. The adjusted operating income margin of 23.2% includes a 0.8 percentage point headwind from pre-tax restructuring-related charges.\n\n3M's net sales for the quarter were $8.3 billion, down 3.6 percent year-on-year, with an organic sales decline of 3.7 percent year-on-year. Adjusted sales were $8.0 billion, down 3.0 percent year-on-year with an adjusted organic sales decline of 3.1 percent year-on-year. Despite these declines, the company's operating cash flow was up 25 percent year-on-year to $1.9 billion, and adjusted free cash flow was up 39 percent year-on-year to $1.9 billion.\n\nShareholder Returns and Outlook\n\nDuring the quarter, 3M returned $828 million to shareholders via dividends. Based on the company's year-to-date performance and continued strong operational execution, 3M is raising its full-year 2023 adjusted EPS and adjusted free cash flow conversion expectations. The company anticipates adjusted EPS to be in the range of $8.95 to $9.15, up from the previous range of $8.60 to $9.10. Adjusted operating cash flow is estimated in the range of $6.5 to $6.9 billion, contributing to 100 to 110 percent adjusted free cash flow conversion.\n\nStory continues\n\nLegal Matters and Restructuring\n\n3M also addressed legal matters with the announced Combat Arms settlement and received preliminary court approval for the PFAS Public Water Systems agreement. The company is progressing with its Health Care spin-off, with leadership appointments already in place and an expected completion during the first half of 2024.\n\nDespite the challenges faced in Q3 2023, 3M's strong operational execution and proactive spending discipline have positioned the company for a solid close to 2023. The company's strengths in material science innovation align with global trends in high-growth markets and sustainability, enabling it to develop indispensable products in attractive areas such as automotive electrification, climate technology, and industrial automation.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3m-co-mmm-q3-2023-134109003.html", "symbols": ["MMM.F", "MMM.MX", "MMM.SW", "MMM.US", "MMM.XETRA", "MMMC34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.992, "neg": 0.045, "neu": 0.823, "pos": 0.132}}, {"date": "2023-10-24T13:08:36+00:00", "title": "3 Dow Jones Stocks Are Celebrating Tuesday Morning", "content": "For many investors, the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) are the focal point of their investing process.

This compares to earnings of $2.69 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 14.53%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of Post-it notes, industrial coatings and ceramics would post earnings of $1.65 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.17, delivering a surprise of 31.52%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.\n\n3M , which belongs to the Zacks Diversified Operations industry, posted revenues of $8.31 billion for the quarter ended September 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.52%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $8.62 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\n3M shares have lost about 28.6% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 9.8%.\n\nWhat's Next for 3M?\n\nWhile 3M has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nStory continues\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for 3M: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $2.42 on $7.84 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $8.93 on $31.61 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Diversified Operations is currently in the top 27% of the 250 plus Zacks industries.

However, it withdrew its previous guidance for 2023 profits and near-term electric vehicle production as costs related to the United Auto Workers strikes jumped to $200 million a week during October.\n\nCoca-Cola (NYSE:KO) stock rose 2.3% after the soft drinks giant raised its annual sales and profit forecasts, benefiting from consumers snapping up its products at higher prices.\n\nCoinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) stock rose 8.2%, with the cryptocurrency exchange benefiting from the speculation that a Bitcoin ETF is shortly to be authorized by the U.S. SEC.\n\nDow (DOW) stock rose 2.5% after the chemicals company beat expectations for third-quarter profit, benefiting from higher prices for its products used in making goods ranging from plastics and paints to building materials.\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock rose 1.8% after Reuters reported that the chipmaker has begun designing central processing units that would run Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s Windows operating system, using technology from  Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM), up 2.4%.\n\nStory continues\n\nRTX stock rose 8.1% after the aerospace supplier approved a $10 billion share repurchase program, even as it reported a near billion dollar quarterly loss due to a major quality crisis at its subsidiary Pratt and Whitney.\n\nBarclays (BCS) ADRs fell 5.6% after the U.K.-based bank signaled another restructuring round in the coming months to mitigate the effects of margin pressure from competition in the savings market and another lackluster performance from its investment bank.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nVerizon, 3M, General Electric, Coca-Cola rise premarket; Spotify, Barclays fall\n\nNvidia says U.S. speeded up new export curbs on AI chips\n\nSpotify Shares Dip Despite Robust Q3 Results and Promising Q4 Outlook", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/verizon-3m-general-electric-coca-073010214.html", "symbols": ["639.F", "639.XETRA", "8GM.F", "ARM.US", "BAC.F", "BAC.XETRA", "BARC.LSE", "BCLYF.US", "BCS.US", "BCY.F", "BCY.XETRA", "BCY2.F", "CCC3.F", "CCC3.XETRA", "COCA34.SA", "COIN.US", "GE.MX", "GE.US", "GEC.LSE"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.986, "neg": 0.033, "neu": 0.865, "pos": 0.103}}, {"date": "2023-10-23T16:10:10+00:00", "title": "Why 3M (MMM) Could Beat Earnings Estimates Again", "content": "Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report? 3M (MMM), which belongs to the Zacks Diversified Operations industry, could be a great candidate to consider.\n\nThis maker of Post-it notes, industrial coatings and ceramics has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 27.32%.\n\nFor the most recent quarter, 3M was expected to post earnings of $1.65 per share, but it reported $2.17 per share instead, representing a surprise of 31.52%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $1.60 per share, while it actually produced $1.97 per share, a surprise of 23.13%.\n\nThanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for 3M lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.\n\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\n3M currently has an Earnings ESP of +1.29%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on October 24, 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.\n\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.\n\nBecause of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

According to a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices, dividends have made up about 32% of the overall returns of the S&P 500 since 1926, with the remaining 68% coming from capital appreciation.\u00a0The S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrat Index, which tracks the performance of companies that have raised their payouts for 25 consecutive years or more, offers a combination of growing capital and regular dividend payments. This is different from other strategies that might focus solely on getting a high yield or only on capital growth. In the long run, the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats have shown better returns with lower volatility compared to the broader market, which means they offer a better balance between risk and reward. The S&P report highlighted that the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats have performed better than the S&P 500 69.34% of the time when the market was down and 43.61% of the time when the market was up. Additionally, they experienced smaller declines in value compared to the benchmark index.\n\nInvestors generally avoid stocks that have a history of reducing or cutting their dividends over time. A dividend cut is often seen as a red flag, signaling financial difficulties or challenges within the company. It may indicate that the company is struggling to generate enough profits to sustain its dividend payments. According to Fidelity research, stocks that reduce or completely stop paying dividends have typically performed 20% to 25% worse than the market in the year before making that decision. The report also highlighted the importance of payout ratios, which refers to the proportion of a company's net income or free cash flow that it distributes as dividends to shareholders. A low payout ratio is generally considered favorable because it indicates that the company has the potential to maintain its dividend payments and even increase them in the future.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlso read: Best Dividend Aristocrats According to Analysts\n\nWhen investing in dividend stocks, investors consider dividend yields, which measure how much income the stock can generate. It is calculated by expressing the annual dividend as a percentage of the stock's price. According to analysts, yields between 3% and 6% are healthy. Having an excessively high yield is generally a warning sign and not a good choice for investors. If a stock has a high yield, it could be because the company's financial troubles are pushing down its stock price. When this happens, the company might have to reduce or stop paying dividends due to its difficulties.\n\nSome of the best dividend aristocrat stocks with strong balance sheets and consistent cash flows include The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc.
