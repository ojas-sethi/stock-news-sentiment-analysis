That continued through today\u2019s initial day of trading to start the week, even as we had few earnings or economic reports to guide it along. The Dow\u2019s performance was most tepid, as has been the case most of the year, +76 points or +0.22%. This is followed by the S&P 500, which is up +2.4% over the last week of trading, +0.38% today. The Nasdaq put up another +131 points on the session, +0.93% (+4.1% since this time a week ago) while the small-cap Russell 2000 grabbed the brass ring, +1.05% on the day.\r\n\r\nThis broadening of the mini bull run we\u2019ve been on is most apparent on the Russell, which had spent March through May flat for the year, and has sprung forward ever since. Small-caps catching a bid erases the narrative that only mega-caps \u2014 or AI-related stocks, or Tech in general \u2014 are driving gains on Wall Street. Since the summer began, this is provably not the case. Can we finally do away with the adage \u201cSell in May and go away\u201d?\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re still a couple days removed from Tesla\u2019s TSLA Q2 earnings report this week, where the electric vehicle (EV) leader is expected to bring in a robust +47% on its top line. But shares gained +3% today on news out of Ford F, which announced it is lowering the price of its F-150 Lightning EV pickup truck, by $6K-$10K, depending on the model. This may bode well for Tesla\u2019s fortunes through Q2 as it remains in command of the EV market for at least another quarter.\r\n\r\nFor the F-150 Lightning \u2014 the EV version of the best-selling vehicle in the U.S. for more than a decade \u2014 Ford is slashing prices on its base model by 17%, from just under $60K to just under $50K. Pricing on its Platinum model is coming down $6000 to around $92K (which likely still prices out many current F-150 owners). This looks like a clear move to attract new customers. As a result, Ford shares dipped -6% on the day, and took down GM GM and Rivian RIVN by -3% each.\r\n\r\nTomorrow morning, Retail Sales, Industrial Production/Capacity Utilization, Business Inventories and a new Home Builder Confidence survey will hit the tape, along with more Q2 earnings from big banks like Bank of America BAC and Morgan Stanley MS, as well as defense firm Lockheed Martin LMT and toys & hobbies mainstay Hasbro HAS. And we only pic up from there \u2014 we expect stronger catalysts for market activity as the week progresses.\r\n\r\nQuestions or comments about this article and/or author?

Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian joins us with the latest. Pras.\n\nPRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Hey, Jared. How's it going, man? So, yeah, big, big price cuts here for the Ford F-150 lightning. Like you mentioned, as much as $10,000 for the Pro base model. But price cuts go across the board, anywhere from 9% to 60% off across all the trims.\n\nPlus Ford is offering $1,000 off this month as an added bonus. So what's going on here is Ford says that they're seeing moderating materials costs. And they're improving scale at their Rouge plant that's bringing down kind of the costs there for producing these F-150s.\n\nBut the price cuts are coming as inventories of new cars rise across the country, including for once hot EVs. Those inventories are rising even more than traditional new cars. So nonetheless, this pricing plus the federal EV tax credits are making the F-150 lightning a relative deal right now.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/video/ford-cuts-price-ev-f-163047486.html", "symbols": ["F.MX", "F.US", "FDMO34.SA", "FMC1.F", "FMC1.XETRA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.769, "neg": 0.05, "neu": 0.873, "pos": 0.077}}, {"date": "2023-07-17T16:22:06+00:00", "title": "Stock market today: Dow rises as banks, tech shine, but telecoms stifle gains", "content": "Investing.com -- The Dow closed higher Monday, led by tech and financials as investors looked ahead to more quarterly results from Wall Street banks and other major corporations later this week, though broader market gains were kept in check by a stumble in telecoms.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2%, or 76 points, the Nasdaq was up 0.9%, and the S&P 500 rose 0.3%.\n\nFinancials rally ahead of earnings from Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs\n\nFinancials rallied more than 1% as investors anticipate further signs of the strength in banks ahead of quarterly results from Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) due Tuesday and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) due Wednesday.\n\nSentiment on major banks was boosted last week following better-than-expected quarterly results from JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), though Citi was the odd one after its earnings fell short of analyst expectations.\n\nUBS, however, warned against extrapolating the better-than-expected results to other banks, and expects \u201ctougher results from regional banks.\u201d\n\nPNC Financial Services Group Inc (NYSE:PNC) and Western Alliance Bancorporation (NYSE:WAL), which are down sharply year-to-date, are slated to report earnings on Friday.\n\nApple, chips lead tech higher\n\nA rise in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and semiconductor stocks including NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) pushed the broader tech sector more than 1% higher as AI-driven optimism ahead of tech earnings persists.\n\n\u201cWe believe overall the tech sector will be up another 12%-15% in the second half of this year led by software and the chip sector with Big Tech remaining the \"torch bearer\" for this tech rally continuing to heat up,\u201d Wedbush said in a note.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), meanwhile, traded just above the flatline even as its pending $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard Inc (NASDAQ:ATVI) inched closer after the Federal Trade Commission lost its appeal to pause the deal.\n\nTesla gets Cybertruck production underway; Ford falters on price cut\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) was up more than 3% after starting production of its Cybertruck in Texas, with the EV maker expected to ship around 2,000 units this year, Deutsche Bank estimated.\n\nThe gains come just ahead of Tesla\u2019s quarterly results due Wednesday, in which margins are likely to dominate attention following recent price cuts.\n\n\u201cThe big focus on this print will be Auto GM (ex credits) to gauge the impact of the price cuts and what this means for margins going forward,\u201d Wedbush said in a note.\n\nFord Motor (NYSE:F), meanwhile, fell more than 5% after cutting prices of its F-150 Lightning by up to $10,000 amid increased competition from Rivian Automotive Inc (NASDAQ:RIVN) and Tesla\u2019s Cybertruck.\n\nParamount stumbles as latest 'Mission: Impossible' blockbuster falls short at box office; AT&T Gets Downgrade Call\n\nParamount Global's (NASDAQ:PARA) \"Mission: Impossible\u201d movie underperformed expectations at the box office, sending the entertainment company\u2019s share more than 3% lower.\n\nThe latest installment in the Mission Impossible franchise racked in $56.2 million domestically over the weekend, below expectations of at least $60 million or more, which would have marked a new franchise record.\n\nTelecoms giant AT&T (NYSE:T) fell 6% after Citi downgraded the stock to Neutral from Buy on concerns that the firm and others face significant costs removing legacy copper cables - used for telephony and other related-purposes - that reportedly may pose a risk environment.

But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.\n\nEveryone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.\n\nFord Motor Company has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), while Tesla has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now. This means that F's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.\n\nValue investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.\n\nThe Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.\n\nF currently has a forward P/E ratio of 8.41, while TSLA has a forward P/E of 79.57. We also note that F has a PEG ratio of 1.35. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. TSLA currently has a PEG ratio of 3.23.\n\nAnother notable valuation metric for F is its P/B ratio of 1.42. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, TSLA has a P/B of 18.26.\n\nThese are just a few of the metrics contributing to F's Value grade of A and TSLA's Value grade of D.\n\nF has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than TSLA, so it seems like value investors will conclude that F is the superior option right now.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Rival General Motors also fell about 3%, while EV maker Rivian was down about 4%. Tesla's shares were up 2% after the company built its first Cybertruck at its Austin plant.\n\nThe Detroit automaker, which had raised Lightning prices earlier this year, said it was able to cut prices on improvements in scale and battery raw material costs.\n\nThe move comes amid a price war started by Tesla a few months ago, which has seen the EVs of legacy automakers piling up at dealers as sales slow. In the quarter through June, Ford's EV sales fell 2.8%.\n\n\"Shortly after launching the F-150 Lightning, rapidly rising material costs, supply constraints and other factors drove up the cost of the EV truck for Ford and our customers,\" said Marin Gjaja, chief customer officer, Ford Model e.\n\n\"We've continued to work in the background to improve accessibility and affordability.\"\n\nFord also said it has temporarily closed its Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Michigan to complete final plant upgrades as it aims to triple the facility's annual run rate to 150,000 Lightning trucks, beginning this fall.\n\nThough pricing will always be a meaningful driver, getting from a $3 billion loss rate for the Ford Model e to breaking even will require the lion's share to come from scale, BNP Paribas Exane analyst, James Picariello said.\n\nBattery raw material prices have been one of the factors that pushed EV prices up. But prices of cobalt and lithium, crucial for EV batteries, have declined.\n\nFord has also strengthened its sourcing options and unveiled new supply deals for battery-grade lithium earlier this year.\n\nThe base Pro variant of Lightning now carries a suggested retail price of $49,995, compared to its prior price of $59,974, while the higher-end Platinum model will cost about 6.2% less, at $91,995.\n\n(Reporting by Nathan Gomes and Shivansh Tiwary in Bengaluru; Editing by Pooja Desai)", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-ford-slashes-prices-f-133229880.html", "symbols": ["F.MX", "F.US", "FDMO34.SA", "FMC1.F", "FMC1.XETRA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.527, "neg": 0.042, "neu": 0.903, "pos": 0.055}}, {"date": "2023-07-17T13:00:11+00:00", "title": "Ford Motor Company (F) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know", "content": "Ford Motor Company (F) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this company have returned +3.9%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, which Ford Motor Company falls in, has gained 9.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Ford Motor Company is expected to post earnings of $0.48 per share, indicating a change of -29.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +3.3% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $1.78 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -5.3%. This estimate has changed +2.6% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.74 indicates a change of -2.3% from what Ford Motor Company is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Ford Motor Company.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of Ford Motor Company, the consensus sales estimate of $39.45 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +4.1%. The $158.87 billion and $158.99 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +6.6% and +0.1%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nFord Motor Company reported revenues of $39.09 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +21.7%. EPS of $0.63 for the same period compares with $0.38 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $36.8 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +6.22%. The EPS surprise was +57.5%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, Ford Motor Company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nFord Motor Company is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Ford Motor Company. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

They believe instead that one could make far more money in lesser time by \"buying high and selling higher.\"\n\nWho doesn't like betting on fast-moving trending stocks? But determining the right entry point isn't easy. Often, these stocks lose momentum once their valuation moves ahead of their future growth potential. In such a situation, investors find themselves loaded up on expensive shares with limited to no upside or even a downside. So, going all-in on momentum could be risky at times.\n\nIt could be safer to invest in bargain stocks that have been witnessing price momentum recently. While the Zacks Momentum Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to trends in a stock's price or earnings, is pretty useful in identifying great momentum stocks, our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen comes handy in spotting fast-moving stocks that are still attractively priced.\n\nThere are several stocks that currently pass through the screen and Ford Motor Company (F) is one of them. Here are the key reasons why this stock is a great candidate.\n\nA dash of recent price momentum reflects growing interest of investors in a stock. With a four-week price change of 3.9%, the stock of this company is certainly well-positioned in this regard.\n\nWhile any stock can see a spike in price for a short period, it takes a real momentum player to deliver positive returns for a longer time frame. F meets this criterion too, as the stock gained 26.8% over the past 12 weeks.\n\nMoreover, the momentum for F is fast paced, as the stock currently has a beta of 1.59. This indicates that the stock moves 59% higher than the market in either direction.\n\nGiven this price performance, it is no surprise that F has a Momentum Score of A, which indicates that this is the right time to enter the stock to take advantage of the momentum with the highest probability of success.\n\nIn addition to a favorable Momentum Score, an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions has helped F earn a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that the momentum-effect is quite strong among Zacks Rank #1 and #2 stocks. That's because as covering analysts raise their earnings estimates for a stock, more and more investors take an interest in it, helping its price race to keep up. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nMost importantly, despite possessing fast-paced momentum features, F is trading at a reasonable valuation. In terms of Price-to-Sales ratio, which is considered as one of the best valuation metrics, the stock looks quite cheap now. F is currently trading at 0.36 times its sales. In other words, investors need to pay only 36 cents for each dollar of sales.\n\nSo, F appears to have plenty of room to run, and that too at a fast pace.\n\nIn addition to F, there are several other stocks that currently pass through our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen. You may consider investing in them and start looking for the newest stocks that fit these criteria.\n\nThis is not the only screen that could help you find your next winning stock pick. Based on your personal investing style, you may choose from over 45 Zacks Premium Screens that are strategically created to beat the market.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that the key to a successful stock-picking strategy is to ensure that it produced profitable results in the past.

In a statement to Yahoo Finance, Ford said new pricing will also apply to dealer stock, and any Lightning ordered but not delivered will also be re-invoiced. The new prices for all trims of the F-150 Lightning are listed below.\n\nWhen Ford debuted the Lightning EV in 2021, the company said the entry level Pro commercial truck would start below $40,000. But for a number of reasons \u2014 including rising material costs, component shortage, and production issues \u2014 Ford had to hike up prices considerably, with the Pro model hitting an MSRP of $59,974 just before today\u2019s price cuts, nearly $20K more than the company had promised\n\nFord said the upgrades at its Rouge Electric Vehicle Center, combined with falling raw material costs and \u201ccontinued work on scaling production and cost,\u201d made it possible for Ford to cut prices across the F-150 Lightning line. Ford is pausing the production at Rouge temporarily to complete upgrades that will boost production to 150,000 Lightning trucks by this fall, which the company had originally planned to do. Ford's Rouge Electric Vehicle Center\n\nThe dramatic pricing cuts of the Lightning come as the company had a strong sales quarter for the pickup, with sales up 119% in Q2 versus a year ago and up 4.1% sequentially from the first quarter. However rising inventories across the board for the automakers, including for once-hot EVs, has likely put pricing pressure on the automakers and their dealer partners to cut prices ahead of the fall, when the industry usually releases new vehicles. Ford CEO Jim Farley told Yahoo Finance in May that the industry was likely going to see price pressure for EVs.\n\nThis may have lead Ford to also reveal that starting today, Ford will offer a $1,000 bonus for the Lightning XLT, Lariat and Platinum trims as part of a summer sales event going from July 6 through July 3rd.

Yes, high-yielding stocks are appealing. But often, a dividend stock has an outsized yield because the stock price tumbled, robbing you of returns. What you want are safe high-yield dividend stocks.\n\nSafe high-yield dividend stocks may not have a ridiculously high yield, but they are as good or better than the average dividend stock on the market. You also can have confidence that the yield will stay intact without sacrificing the stock price.\n\nThat\u2019s important for dividend investors. Many chasing yield do so because they rely on the quarterly or monthly income to supplement their retirement checks. Dividend investors often need that income to keep their retirement plans on track.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nI suggest using the Portfolio Grader and the Dividend Grader to help identify the best safe high-yield dividend stocks to buy today. Here are seven that have outstanding scores.\n\nFord (F) Hummer in a forest\n\nFord (NYSE:F) is one of the original \u201cBig Three\u201d Detroit automotive companies. While the automotive market is more diversified, Ford stays relevant and even thrives.\n\nEarnings in the first quarter showed revenue of $41.47 billion, up more than 20% from the previous year. Income was $1.76 billion, or 44 cents in earnings per share.\n\nThe company is reporting second-quarter earnings on July 27, but early indications are that it will be another solid report. Ford announced sales gains of 11.2% in the second quarter, while truck sales jumped by 26.2%.\n\nThe F-150 Lightning electric vehicle saw sales up 119% from a year ago and 4.1% from the first quarter.\n\nFord nearly doubled its dividend in April, from 8 cents per share to 15 cents per share, giving it a solid yield of almost 4%. And it\u2019s already announced the yield will stay at 15 cents for the third quarter.\n\nF stock is up 30% this year and gets a \u201cB\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nNew York Community Bancorp (NYCB) bank stocks\n\nSource: fizkes / Shutterstock.com\n\nRegional banks are typically good to avoid this year because we\u2019ve already had three that failed. But with every rule, there\u2019s an exception. That brings us to an outstanding regional bank, New York Community Bancorp (NYSE:NYCB).\n\nNYCB is a hot banking stock and a safe high-yield dividend stock because it bought most of the deposits and $13 billion in loans of failed Signature Bank (OTCMKTS:SBNY).\n\nThe deal is a huge win for New York Community Bancorp, taking Signature\u2019s discounted assets to shore up its balance sheet. The bank now has $123.8 billion in assets, a gain of 37% from the previous quarter.\n\nIn the year, NYCB is up 36%. Raymond James analyst Steve Moss says the bank will continue outperforming its peers.\n\n\u201cWe also expect NYCB will report a stronger balance sheet because of capital generation and lower wholesale funding, post the March 2023 acquisition of SBNY from the FDIC. If NYCB can sustain these trends, and keep most of SBNY\u2019s teams, we believe the stock\u2019s valuation should re-rate meaningfully higher over time,\u201d he said.\n\nNYCM offers a dividend yield of 6% and has a \u201cB\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nExxon Mobil (XOM) XOM Stock Is on the Way Back, but It Will Take Some Time\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nExxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) has long been among my top energy stocks. The global oil and gas conglomerate made $55.7 billion in profits last year. It\u2019s on target in 2023 as well, even though oil prices are down from 2022.\n\nEarnings in the first quarter were $84.18 billion in revenue and $11.43 billion in income, or $2.83 per share. It\u2019s also doing a great job of taking care of shareholders; the dividend of 91 cents per share equates to a yield of 3.4% and a payout ratio of less than 40%.\n\nExxon repurchased $4.3 billion in shares in the first quarter, with plans to buy back $17.5 billion in shares in 2023.\n\nExxon raised its dividend yearly for the last 40 years, so investors can feel confident that the yields will continue, even though the stock price is down 5% in 2023.\n\nXOM gets a \u201cB\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nNordic American Tankers (NAT) A photo of a large oil ship on water\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nWhen you think about great stocks to buy, I won\u2019t blame you if you don\u2019t immediately think of oil tankers cruising worldwide. But this is a lucrative business.\n\nAnd you would be hard-pressed to find an oil tanker that\u2019s safer than Nordic American Tankers (NYSE:NAT).\n\nThe company has 19 tankers with a cargo lifting capacity of 1 million barrels of oil.\n\nOperating one of those tankers takes about $8,000 per day, but the time charter equivalent rate is $51,900.\u00a0At that rate, Nordic American is virtually printing money.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a cheap stock to buy, then Nordic American is also very interesting. Shares are less than $4 each, so you can buy a lot of shares for not a lot of money. The stock price is up 23% in 2023.\n\nFirst-quarter earnings came in at 22 cents per share on profits of $46.9 million. The dividend yield is nearly 16%.\n\nNAT stock has an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nLife Storage (LSI) Life Storage (LSI) sign on the side of one of its facilities in Illinois.\n\nSource: Jerry Bergquist / Shutterstock.com\n\nLife Storage (NYSE:LSI) is a New York-based REIT in the self-storage business. There are more than 51,000 self-storage businesses in the U.S., with an annual revenue of $29 billion. Life Storage has more than 1,100 of those units in 37 U.S. states.\n\nFirst-quarter earnings of $273.6 million beat analysts\u2019 estimates for $264.5 million, although the company fell just short of expectations on EPS, bringing in 96 cents per share when the Street expected $1.04.\n\nOne item of note: Life Storage recently announced a dividend of 90 cents per share, less than its normal dividend of $1.20. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s anything to worry about.\n\nThe company says the dividend is impacted by the company\u2019s pending merger with Extra Space Storage (NYSE:EXR) that is expected to be completed later this month.\n\nLife Storage says that if the deal doesn\u2019t close as quickly as expected, Life Storage plans to pay a one time dividend that would make up for the shortfall.\n\nLSI stock is up 40% this year, getting a \u201cB\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nWendy\u2019s Company (WEN) A photo of a Wendy's chicken sandwich and chicken nuggets.\n\nSource: Deutschlandreform / Shutterstock.com\n\nWendy\u2019s Company (NASDAQ:WEN) is an Ohio-based fast-food burger chain made famous by late founder Dave Thomas\u2019 ubiquitous commercial campaign and named for his daughter. It\u2019s now the No. 3 burger chain in the U.S., with more than 7,000 locations.\n\nFirst-quarter earnings include revenue of $528.8 million and EPS of 21 cents, better than analysts\u2019 expectations for $522.4 million and 20 cents EPS.\n\nThe company\u2019s also not afraid to experiment to keep up with technology and hopefully get a step ahead of its competitors. It\u2019s begun incorporating AI automation into its drive-through ordering platform and is experimenting with an autonomous robot system to deliver food orders placed for pickup.\n\nWEN stock provides a dividend yield of 4.7% and has a \u201cB\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nEnterprise Products Partners (EPD) A magnifying glass zooms in on the website of Enterprise Product Partners (EPD)\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nREITs are the only income investment vehicles with a unique tax structure.

The corporation pays taxes on earnings before it shares the windfall with investors as dividends. By taking advantage of tax benefits like depreciation and depletion, MLPs reduce the taxes on income and often provide sizable dividend yields.\n\nEPD currently pays a 7.5% dividend yield.

One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!\n\nRemember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you.\n\nView our latest analysis for Ford Motor\n\nWhat's The Estimated Valuation?\n\nWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nGenerally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast\n\n2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$4.11b US$5.18b US$5.59b US$5.94b US$6.23b US$6.49b US$6.72b US$6.93b US$7.12b US$7.30b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x4 Analyst x4 Est @ 7.93% Est @ 6.18% Est @ 4.96% Est @ 4.10% Est @ 3.51% Est @ 3.09% Est @ 2.79% Est @ 2.59% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 14%  US$3.6k US$4.0k US$3.8k US$3.5k US$3.2k US$3.0k US$2.7k US$2.4k US$2.2k US$2.0k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$30b\n\nThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 14%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$7.3b\u00d7 (1 + 2.1%) \u00f7 (14%\u2013 2.1%) = US$63b\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$63b\u00f7 ( 1 + 14%)10= US$17b\n\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$47b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$15.0, the company appears slightly overvalued at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind. dcf\n\nThe Assumptions\n\nWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Ford Motor as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 14%, which is based on a levered beta of 2.000. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for Ford Motor\n\nStrength\n\nDebt is well covered by earnings.\n\nDividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.\n\nWeakness\n\nEarnings declined over the past year.\n\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Auto market.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.\n\nGood value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.\n\nThreat\n\nDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.\n\nAnnual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.\n\nLooking Ahead:\n\nAlthough the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to \"what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?\" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Can we work out why the company is trading at a premium to intrinsic value?
