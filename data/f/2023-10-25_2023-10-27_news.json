In 2025, its expected that EV sales will account for half of car sales worldwide. It will also account for 85% of car sales in the U.S. While the competition is fierce in the market, the continuously rising demand for EVs still leaves EV companies with a high-growth potential.

Headquartered in Amsterdam, Stellanis is a European EV powerhouse. The company boasts a market cap of around $60 billion, amongst the highest in the EV space. From both a qualitative and quantitative outlook, Stellanis is a buy.\n\nWith a P/E ratio of about 2.75 in comparison to the industry average of around nine, Stellanis has a lot of unfulfilled potential in terms of price. The company\u2019s financials are strong, with Stellanis having a P/B ratio of 0.70. Compare this to an industry average of around 1.3. Additionally, the company has strong profit margins and large revenue. Each quarter, it rapidly grows its revenue, making a large profit. On the other hand, many other EV companies are constantly turning a loss. \r\nThe company has significant room for growth, dominating the large European EV market. As of now, they control the majority of the European market and are making impressive strides in the North American one. This is signaling that they will absorb much of the industry growth.

The company announced that the company delivered more than 15,000 Smart EVs last month alone, which was a 12% increase from August and 81% increase year-over-year (YoY)\n\nFurthermore, XPeng recently delivered 750 of its vehicles to Israel. This was the largest single batch of exports for the year. Despite facing regulations abroad, specifically in Europe and the United States, the Chinese EV maker seems adamant on expanding its operations in Israel. Potentially, XPeng will expand to the larger Middle East market. XPeng has partnered with Israel company Frisbee, revealing the company\u2019s ability to customize its products based on consumer preferences. The company is trying to expand its operations worldwide, and thus far has been successful. Expanding internationally allows it to tap into potential outside the highly competitive Chinese market, instead allowing the company to focus on growth and profitability.\u00a0XPeng definitely earns its spot on our list of EV stocks to buy.\n\nFord (F) Ford logo badge on grill of car\n\nSource: JuliusKielaitis / Shutterstock.com\n\nFord (NYSE:F) is one of the largest automobile companies in the world. It is headquartered in the U.S. The size of the company supplements its EV segment, which has been seeing success. Ford\u2019s Model e EV has experienced a 44% increase in shipments and a 26% revenue growth. Though Ford is losing money from selling EVs, it has been a dominant company for decades. This permits its other operations to subsidize its losses. Meanwhile, smaller EV competitors like Lucid face the risk of bankruptcy if they take on excessive losses.\n\nFord also came to an agreement with the United Auto Workers union, ending a concern about its short-term prospects. They have been investing heavily into their EV segment, stopping production of various gas-fueled cars to hone in on EVs. I think that Ford\u2019s financial stability, strong presence and heavy investments in EV will lead to it absorbing much of the growth that is expected to arise in the EV industry.\u00a0If you are looking for EV stocks to buy, this is a great place to start!\n\nOn the date of publication, Tomas Levani did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Research firm Kelley Blue Book (KBB) finds that US EV sales in the third quarter crossed 313,000, nearly a 50% increase from a year ago, with EV market share hitting 7.9% \u2014 its highest ever level. But this milestone might not be good enough for automakers spending billions on an EV transformation.\n\n\u201cA great product is not enough in the EV business anymore. We have to be totally competitive on cost,\u201d Ford (F) CEO Jim Farley said on Thursday night\u2019s Q3 earnings call. Ford recently paused $12 billion worth of investments in its EV projects until \u201ccapacity\u201d is needed. Ford said in its earnings report that US EV buyers were \u201cunwilling to pay premiums for [EVs] over gas or hybrid vehicles, sharply compressing EV prices and profitability.\u201d\n\nThough Ford said it was bullish on its upcoming Gen 2 and Gen 3 EVs, the company\u2019s downbeat assessment of the US electric market echoes what GM (GM) reported earlier this week.\n\n\"We are also moderating the acceleration of EV production in North America to protect our pricing, adjust to slower near-term growth in demand, and implement engineering efficiency and other improvements that will make our vehicles less expensive to produce, and more profitable,\" CEO Mary Barra said in her Q3 shareholder letter. GM, in pushing back its EV truck expansion earlier this month, noted \u201cevolving EV demand\u201d as the main reason why it was slowing its EV truck volumes.\n\nEven Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, perhaps the biggest EV evangelist in the industry, poured cold water on the EV market and general economic landscape. Musk noted on Tesla\u2019s conference call last Wednesday that the company was delaying construction of its upcoming Gigafactory in Mexico due to concerns about global economic conditions stemming from rising interest rates that make financing cars more expensive for consumers, thus crimping demand.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m worried about the high interest rate environment we\u2019re in,\u201d Musk said, adding, \u201cI just can\u2019t emphasize enough how important cost is. \u2026. We have to make our products more affordable so people can buy [them].\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nJessica Caldwell, head of insights at automotive research firm Edmunds agrees with Musk. \u201cThe current high-interest environment also doesn't favor convincing consumers to explore less-established auto technology, and cost is already placing EVs beyond the reach of many consumers,\u201d Caldwell said to Yahoo Finance. \u201cFollowing a decade of bigger spending due to low interest rates, consumers now find themselves needing to economize.\u201d\n\nNew research from J.D. Power out Friday morning puts automaker concerns about pricing and the consumer in stark contrast to once rosy EV sales projections.\n\n\u201cOne complicating factor that could be a drag on near-term EV sales, however, is the pricing imbalance that currently exists between EVs and ICE [internal combustion engine] vehicles in the booming compact SUV segment,\u201d J.D. Power noted in its report. \u201cCurrently, the bulk of mass market compact EV SUV sales are pricing at around $52,000. That compares with just $34,000 for comparable mass market ICE SUVs. Meanwhile, ICE vehicles in the compact premium SUV segment are trading at around $53,000, vs. EVs in the compact premium SUV segment selling for $60,000 or more.\u201d\n\nDespite concerns about pricing, J.D. Power believes critical mass has already been hit with EVs, and the firm is projecting retail EV sales to hit 3 million by end of this year and 4 million by the end of Q3 2024.\n\nOne area that will help sales starting next year, J.D. Power says, is the $7,500 EV tax credit can be used immediately at point of sale for eligible, instead of waiting for a tax refund. \u201cThis is a significant departure from the current implementation of the credit, whereby eligible buyers do not receive the credit until they receive their tax returns,\u201d J.D. Power said in its report.\n\nWhile a tax credit pull forward is nice, it seems buyers will need more incentives to make up for the price differential between EVs and gas-powered cars and cover the increased financing costs as a result of higher rates. This does not even begin to take into consideration range anxiety and lack of charging infrastructure, which a whopping 77% of respondents to Yahoo Finance/Ipsos EV poll found to be the most pressing concern when considering an EV.\n\n\u201cInfrastructure for charging is the elephant in the room. Augmentation of the charging infrastructure must align with the growing acceptance of EVs, if not precede it,\u201d Edmunds\u2019 Caldwell added.\n\nGM, Ford, and even Tesla keeping cash in reserve and deploying it when economic conditions stabilize seems to be the best call, at least from Wall Street\u2019s perspective.\n\n\u201cFord\u2019s balance sheet remains flush with liquidity to help fund the transition to electrified vehicles and software services as well as provide a buffer for whenever the next recession comes,\u201d Morningstar analyst David Whiston wrote in a note to clients on Friday morning. \u201cThis ample funding gives Ford time to reinvent itself, and more time is needed for cost control.\u201d\n\nIt seems the White House goal of 50% EV sales by 2030 is lofty at this point and overly optimistic, whereas only a couple years back policymakers believed Americans wouldn't even need convincing to go electric.\n\nCaldwell said that there are likely to bumps along the road. \u201cWhile the global shift toward EVs is inevitable, the path to mass adoption may be punctuated by periods of sluggish progress, which is the phase we find ourselves in now,\u201d she said.\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

It was a success, and most of the other machines in my garage \u2014 trimmer, weed whacker, chain saw, rototiller, leaf blower, snow thrower \u2014 are now powered by batteries I recharge from an electrical outlet.\n\nMy car, however, is not electric, and I still don\u2019t foresee a day when I\u2019ll choose an electric vehicle over a gasoline-powered one. I love EV technology, and I\u2019m glad most automakers are rolling out electrics. But EVs are too far above the practicality curve for me, and it\u2019s not clear if or when they\u2019ll fall inside it.\n\nThe choices on display in my garage are now playing out in the broader market for EVs, where automakers are beginning to pause aggressive efforts to transition rapidly from gas-powered cars to electrics. EV sales are still growing. They\u2019ve jumped from barely nothing a few years ago to 8% of all new car sales. But demand seems to be flagging, forcing automakers to cut prices for EVs, which are not profitable yet for most companies that make them.\n\nFord, General Motors, Honda, and Volkswagen have scaled back EV plans recently or warned about disappointing sales. Even high-flying Tesla, which only makes electrics and lost money for 14 years before turning its first profit in 2020, is slashing prices and delaying the opening of a new factory in Mexico.\n\nNone of this means EVs are a failure. The difficulty most automakers face is predicting adoption rates for the new technology and adjusting their production plans to match what is basically a moving target. Retooling assembly lines to switch from gas-powered cars to electrics is cumbersome and expensive. So is opening new factories to build EVs or components such as the big battery packs they require.\n\nRising interest rates, meanwhile, are forcing buyers to change their plans. And now, the type of fuel that powers your car has become a political issue. Former President Donald Trump has decided EVs = bad, calling them the \u201cridiculous all-electric car hoax.\u201d He\u2019s wrong. EVs are here to stay. But they\u2019re not for everybody, and in addition to all the other considerations involving a car, potential buyers now have to ask whether an EV fits their political brand.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe biggest unknown about EVs is how much of the market they\u2019ll constitute at any given point in time, and how to get the supply-demand balance right. President Biden, who promised to \u201cend fossil fuel\u201d as a presidential candidate in 2019, wants half of all new cars to be zero-emission vehicles by 2030. For the most part, that means electrics. But Biden can\u2019t force people to buy EVs. He can only set regulations and sign legislation giving them reason to do so, such as the EV tax credits that were in last year\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nEvaluating the pros and cons of electrification as you move up the appliance chain from power tools to automobiles helps explain why there may be a demand ceiling for current EV technology. My battery-powered lawnmower is a hit because the technology forces no tradeoffs on me. It cost a little bit more than a gas-powered model, but there\u2019s no gasoline, oil, or other messy fluids, and I charge it at home. There\u2019s basically no maintenance, either. You just pop in a fresh battery and start it up like you would a vacuum cleaner. It\u2019s quieter than gas mowers, and I don\u2019t pollute the air or breathe in carcinogens while mowing.\n\nAs I was writing this story, I decided to scribble some ways of measuring the usefulness of various gizmos, and ended up drawing my personal practicality curve, as you can see below. There are no numerical values associated with the various products I\u2019ve plotted on this chart. All I want to convey is the relative appeal of different types of products, based on what I value as a consumer. Machine rankings, in chicken-scratch\n\nCost is on the vertical access and convenience is on the horizontal axis. I\u2019m willing to pay more money for more convenience, and vice versa, which is why my practicality curve rises from left to right. I define convenience broadly to include what I want from these products, which for me is ease of use, reliability, and a sense that I\u2019m being a thoughtful consumer. Your results may vary.\n\nI could have bought a gas mower instead of my electric for a little less money, but it scores low on convenience because I\u2019d have to buy gas for it, maintain it, and tolerate needless noise and pollution. So it falls outside my practicality curve.\n\n[Drop Rick Newman a note, follow him on Twitter, or sign up for his newsletter.]\n\nThe worst machine on the planet right now is the gas-powered leaf blower, which generates obscene amounts of noise and pollution in the service of vanquishing leaves or dust. It occupies the worst spot on my practicality chart, in the northwest quadrant, where it\u2019s a terrible combination of cost and convenience.\n\nAll my battery-powered electric tools fall inside the practicality curve for the same reasons my lawnmower does: no liquid fuels, no maintenance, always ready, plus they\u2019re quieter and cleaner than gas-powered equivalents. I have a small yard, though, and if I had to manage an acre or more, these tools might not be up to the job. Rick's electric armada\n\nNow for the cars. I have only one car, and I go on long trips sometimes when I have to gas up along the way. I simply need the range and easy refueling that comes with a gas-powered car. EVs are ideal for people who never drive long distances, or who have more than one car, including a gas-powered one they can use for road trips.\n\nYes, you can take long trips in an EV. But charging takes a lot longer than filling with gas, under the best circumstances, and you might have to go out of your way to find a charger. You should also assume you\u2019ll get less than your car\u2019s advertised range. Those tradeoffs and others put EVs outside my practicality curve, since I travel to remote areas sometimes and I don\u2019t want to lengthen my trips substantially by hunting for a charger or killing time while my car powers up.\n\nEVs do come with some of the same advantages that battery-powered lawnmowers do: You can charge them at home most of the time. They require less maintenance and they\u2019re cleaner. So what would it take to get EVs inside my practicality curve?\n\nThe answer is simple: more range and faster refueling. Those cars actually exist. They\u2019re called hybrids, in the vein of the Toyota Prius that debuted all the way back in 1999. Most modern hybrids are plug-ins, which means you can charge a battery that will give you 20 or 30 miles of range, before a gasoline-powered electric motor kicks in, to assist. You can always run the car on gasoline, so you don\u2019t have to worry about a dead battery or an hours-long refueling odyssey.\n\nBut automakers and policymakers have focused less on hybrids than on fully electric cars with no gasoline backup. Many of the hybrids that are available are upscale models or top trim lines beyond the reach of ordinary buyers, which puts them high on the cost axis on my practicality chart. Federal tax credits apply to hybrids as they do to electrics, but complex rules on domestic-content requirements limit the applicability to a handful of models.\n\nSome analysts think the EV transition would be going smoother if there were more deliberate focus on hybrids as a bridging strategy. \u201cTell me why we abandoned hybrids,\u201d Sarah Emerson, managing principal at Energy Security Analysis, Inc, told me during an interview last year. \u201cWe can\u2019t have hybrids because we want to get rid of gasoline.

About 1,100 other UAW members walked off the job at Blue Cross Blue Shield in Michigan during the same period.\n\nIt is not clear whether these workers who are in the direct life, health and medical insurance carrier industry were part of the broader industrial action by the UAW against the automakers.\n\nStriking workers who do not receive a paycheck during the period that the government surveys business establishments for the employment report are treated as unemployed.\n\nThe UAW launched limited strikes on Sept. 15, which expanded in October. The work stoppages have disrupted supply chains, resulting in the three automakers furloughing and laying off thousands of non-striking workers.\n\nThe hit from the strike will likely come through a decline in manufacturing employment, where payrolls have been rising moderately. The government will publish its closely watched employment report for October next Friday.\n\nAccording to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 172,000 jobs last month. That would be a big step-down from the 336,000 jobs added in September, the most in eight months.\n\nStill, job growth would more than exceed the roughly 100,000 positions needed per month to keep up with growth in the working age population, testament of the labor market's resilience despite massive interest rates hikes from the Federal Reserve to cool demand in the economy.\n\nFord and the UAW reached a tentative deal this week.

It released its third-quarter results on Thursday after the bell, missing expectations. Now this comes just after the UAW and the automaker reached a tentative agreement that will be voted on by Union members this coming Sunday. We want to bring in Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian, who has been following all of this closely. Pras, take us through the latest.\n\nPRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Hey, Diane. Yeah, so, a highly anticipated report last night following the big news of that UAW tentative deal and then they reported mixed results shortly after that. But a few things stood out to me with the report and also the ensuing conference call.\n\nSo the first thing was Ford said that it was on pace to hit its improved outlook before the strike. But as we know, it pulled the guidance last night similar to GM due to uncertainty here. Ford said it lost $100 million in Q3 and 1.2 billion in Q4 due to the strike. But it said, that its costs are still unknown as it restarts production.\n\nSo I was a little surprised to hear-- when you get an updated figure yet-- they said they will issue one shortly. Number two, Ford is pushing back its EV investments saying last night it's going to push out around $12 billion in those EV investments until capacity is needed.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt means they're going to pause some plants that were scheduled to be built in the next couple of years. Ford said in a statement that many North American customers interested in buying EVs are unwilling to pay premiums for them over gas or hybrid cars, thus sort of compressing profitability and prices. So it's a challenging environment over price with EVs.\n\nAnd now they're saying that they still want to keep investing in EVs but they want to focus on their next Gen cars because their current cars aren't necessarily competitive on cost and features. Basically saying that Ford is not competitive right now compared to Tesla. And finally, it's unclear in what they said-- with the tentative deal that if battery plants are part of the UAW agreement, Ford CFO John Lawler on a media call declined to say if unionization at battery plants was part of the deal.\n\nNow Ford, of course, isn't at liberty to talk about these things because of the fact that they still need to be discussed. The UAW is still discussing these things with their membership before they can vote on it like you mentioned. But this is a big reason why the UAW didn't strike additional GM plants a few weeks ago because it said that GM agreed to include battery plants as part of the Master Agreement as they call it.\n\nSo it's unclear if Ford has this sort of provision in the UAW contract that it agreed to, but I can't imagine it doesn't after the UAW made such a big deal about those battery plants included into the Master Agreement.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/video/ford-outlook-suffers-amid-uaw-145125895.html", "symbols": ["F.MX", "F.US", "FDMO34.SA", "FMC1.F", "FMC1.XETRA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.958, "neg": 0.042, "neu": 0.888, "pos": 0.07}}, {"date": "2023-10-27T14:37:25+00:00", "title": "Ford Stock Tumbles After Auto Maker Withdraws Guidance, Citing Strike", "content": "[**Ford Motor (F)**](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/F) shares swooned after the auto maker withdrew its guidance for the year, citing the impact of the United Auto Workers strike.

Loss before interest and taxes widened to $1,380 million with an EBIT margin of negative 75.6% amid high costs in the development of technologically advanced products.\n\nTotal wholesale volume in the\u00a0Ford Pro segment decreased 2% year over year to 314,000 and missed our expectation of 382,000 units. However, revenues from the segment grew 16% year over year to $13.8 billion and beat our expectations of $11.8 billion. Earnings before interest and taxes came in at $1,654 million with an EBIT margin of 12%.\n\nStory continues\n\nOverall, Ford\u2019s total automotive revenues came in at around $41,176 million, surpassing our estimate of $36,588 million on stronger-than-expected results from Ford Blue and Ford Pro units.\n\nSecond-quarter revenues from the\u00a0Ford Credit unit came in at $2,625 million, up 20% year over year. Pretax earnings totaled $358 million, falling from $589 million in the year-ago quarter. Reduced financing margin, the absence of gains in derivative market valuations and a decrease in the residual values of leased vehicles adversely impacted the results.\n\nFinancial Position\n\nFord reported adjusted free cash flow of $1,225 million for the quarter. It had cash and cash equivalents of $26,427 million as of Sep 30, 2023. Long-term debt, excluding Ford Credit, totaled $19.33 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2023.\n\nDespite a tentative agreement with the United Auto Workers, the strike brought uncertainty to Ford\u2019s fiscal year results. Given the extent of its influence and the pending ratification of the agreement, Ford withdrew its full-year 2023 guidance.\n\nZacks Rank & Key Picks\n\nFord currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nA few top-ranked players in the auto space include\u00a0Toyota TM, Honda HMC and Nissan NSANY, each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Despite an initial dip post-split, astute investors should see its current price as an enticing entry point.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAt the heart of LAC\u2019s potential lies the Thacker Pass project. Boasting a formidable 40-year mine life, this project, estimated to have a net present value of $5.7 billion, could become a massive revenue generator, especially if lithium prices rise. LAC\u2019s collaboration with General Motors adds another layer of assurance.\n\nWith GM\u2019s investment commitment of $650 million and an off-take agreement, there\u2019s a predictable cash flow trajectory awaiting post-production. There also are whispers about the Department of Energy contemplating a whopping $1 billion loan for Thacker Pass.

Diversifying its portfolio, BYD\u2019s freshly minted sub-brand is ready to debut SUVs, off-road vehicles, and sports cars, reflecting its sharp market acumen in its rising delivery numbers.\n\nThe financial prowess of BYD is nothing short of impressive, though, boasting a 204% surge in profits in a mere six-month span.\n\nAs it spreads its tentacles in global territories, including France, Japan, and Australia, BYD ensures it\u2019s not just tethered to its Chinese roots, offering a buffer against potential domestic regulatory challenges. With the momentum it\u2019s building, 2024 could very well be the year the EV player dominates its niche globally.\n\nSolid Power (SLDP) Smartphone with logo of American battery company Solid Power Inc. on screen in front of business website.

By the close of 2023, Solid Power aims to present its EV cells to these partners for validation tests, a move likely to reshape its trajectory.\n\nThe financial footing of the firm is rock-solid, boasting a cash reserve of $443 million at the end of the second quarter. Their projected cash expenditure for this year falls in the $120 to $140 million range, signaling a robust financial runway extending into 2025.\n\nWhile full commercialization may hover around 2025 or 2026, several catalysts could propel SLDP stock upwards, especially with the production of its EV cells having already begun.\n\nPanasonic (PCRFY) A Panasonic (PCRFY) sign hanging in Beijing, China. generation z\n\nSource: testing/Shutterstock.com\n\nPanasonic (OTCMKTS:PCRFY) isn\u2019t just any name on Tesla\u2019s supplier list; it stands out as a trusted ally in the EV pioneer\u2019s electric journey.\n\nWhile skeptics point out that Tesla is Panasonic\u2019s primary revenue source, it\u2019s tough to ignore the company\u2019s strategic maneuvers. The company is capitalizing on its pioneering advantage, amplifying its production capabilities and positioning itself to reap benefits from the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nIt continues to innovate aggressively and refine its lithium-ion battery design while holding promising patents for solid-state battery technologies that could challenge lithium-ion\u2019s EV dominance.\n\nExpansion is in full throttle, with plans to inaugurate four additional EV battery plants, aiming for a whopping 200-gigawatt-hour production by 2031, a potential fourfold surge from the previous year\u2019s capacity. Hence, Panasonic\u2019s vision makes it an intriguing long-term prospect in the EV battery sphere.\n\nAlbemarle (ALB) Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com\n\nAlbemarle (NYSE:ALB) has effectively weathered the downturn in the lithium market, emerging as a potential value pick with an enticing forward P/E of 5.2.\n\nComplementing its valuation is a commendable dividend yield of 1.2%, complemented by 28 consecutive years of growth. However, the crux of ALB\u2019s allure lies in its forward-thinking expansion strategy. In 2022, the company declared a lithium conversion capacity of 200ktpa and has set its sights on nearly tripling this by 2027.\n\nIts second quarter financials further bolstered its optimistic narrative, with its net income soaring to $650 million from the preceding year\u2019s $406.8 million, with net sales rising by a notable 60%. This commendable growth, primarily attributed to the Energy Storage and Ketjen ventures, prompted the company to revise its full-year forecasts optimistically. Given the global pivot to EVs, and the expected rebound in lithium prices, Albemarle\u2019s prospects are undoubtedly gleaming.\n\nAmplify Lithium & Battery Technology ETF (BATT) Electric car lithium battery pack and power connections. MMAT stock\n\nSource: asharkyu / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhen venturing into the rapidly evolving EV battery niche, investors usually grapple with the volatility of individual stocks.\n\nA savvy strategy, in this case, is pivoting to exchange-traded funds, offering diversified exposure with marginalized risks. One such noteworthy ETF in the sector is the Amplify Lithium & Battery Technology ETF (NYSE:BATT).\n\nOut of its vast umbrella of 50 distinct holdings, industry giants, including Tesla and BYD, unmistakably shine through. It deftly extends its reach to companies, including Albemarle and an array of other potential-laden lithium miners.\n\nWith over $120 million in assets under management, BATT\u2019s credentials remain robust, though some investors might find its 0.59% expense ratio a tad on the higher side.\n\nWhile BATT is unlikely to transform your portfolio overnight singularly, its strategic composition positions it as a conduit to a sector offering tremendous potential multi-baggers in the foreseeable future.\n\nToyota Motors (TM) Toyota (TM) logo on the building of a dealership during daylight\n\nSource: josefkubes / Shutterstock.com\n\nToyota Motors (NYSE:TM), traditionally famed for its mid-range cars and hybrid innovations, is revving up to carve its niche in the EV battery segment.\n\nWhile including an automaker might seem rather unconventional, Toyota\u2019s ambitions of becoming a vertically integrated player in the battery space cannot be overlooked. The company invests in internal solid-state battery development, targeting a game-changing 1,000 km range, with mass production likely to roll out by 2027.\n\nTo back this ambitious vision, Toyota earmarked a colossal $13.6 billion for battery investments over the next decade. This financial strategy includes pumping $9 billion into production, intending to electrify its extensive vehicle lineup.\n\nBy 2025, the auto giant envisions 10 active battery production lines, expanding to a staggering 70 in the foreseeable future.

But the jury is out on whether his aggressive bargaining tactics have soured worker relations with the automakers for a long time.\n\nSix weeks into escalating strikes and heated rhetoric, the United Auto Workers (UAW) president extracted a record 25% wage hike for some 57,000 Ford Motor workers in a tentative deal.\n\nFain, representing nearly 150,000 auto workers in one of the biggest labor strikes in decades, upended tradition by taking simultaneous action against all three automakers - a bolder, riskier path than his predecessors.\n\nThe strike started as the clock hit midnight on Sept. 15, and followed Fain's decision to open negotiations with Ford, General Motors and Stellantis at once, eschewing public niceties involving choreographed handshakes that famously kicked off previous negotiating efforts.\n\nIn the past weeks, he ran what amounted to a public auction among the companies, while prior UAW presidents picked just one automaker to set a pattern for the other two.\n\nWearing T-shirts with slogans like \"EAT THE RICH\", Fain, 54, announced walkouts at the companies' most profitable factories making SUVs and trucks, pitting them against each other to come up with offers quickly.\n\n\"Fain used a series of new tactics for these strikes and negotiations, and the tentative deal at Ford demonstrates how effective those tactics were,\" said Lynne Vincent, assistant professor in Syracuse University's Whitman School of Management.\n\n\"He took the risk of changing the playbook, and it paid off at Ford and may continue to pay off at the other automakers.\"\n\nFain was especially tough on Ford, which in the past cultivated a collaborative relationship with the UAW. He said last week: \"The days of the UAW and Ford being a team to fight other companies are over. We will always and forever be on the side of working people everywhere.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nFain won office by a narrow margin in a first-ever direct election earlier this year and has sought alliances with high-profile progressive politicians such as U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders to reframe the UAW's contract bargaining as a battle to reset the balance of power between workers and global corporations.\n\nIn lengthy social media talks to UAW members, Fain alternates quoting Bible verses with the use of charts and graphs to dissect wage and benefit offers from the automakers - details his predecessors kept behind closed doors during bargaining crunch time.\n\nThe strategy is not without risk.\n\n\"He won the battle, but whether he wins the war or not, which is to have more union workers getting paid more, is unclear,\" said Jeffrey Scharf, Chairman of Act Two Investors and a former holder of GM stock.\n\n\"That's what I would be more worried about if I was a young auto worker. I would worry about whether this is going to cost me my job in the long-term.\"\n\nCOMPETITIVENESS AND POLITICS\n\nThe automakers, along with some analysts and investors, have said the higher costs from any potential deal will hobble their ability to close the gap with electric-vehicle (EV) market leader Tesla and harm workers in the long run.\n\nFain, however, has rebutted automakers' concerns about labor costs by pointing out that they have poured billions into share buybacks to benefit investors.\n\n\"If they've got money for Wall Street they sure as hell have money for the workers making the product,\" he said.\n\nDuring negotiations, Fain clashed with Ford CEO Jim Farley and GM chief Mary Barra, citing their million-dollar paychecks as one of the reasons they should be rewarding workers.\n\nThe strike has also became a political issue in the 2024 U.S. presidential campaign.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, facing re-election next year, joined Fain on a picket line outside Detroit on Sept. 26. His chief rival, former President Donald Trump, visited Michigan the next day to woo auto workers' votes with an anti-EV message.\n\n\"This tentative agreement provides a record raise to auto workers who have sacrificed so much to ensure our iconic Big Three companies can still lead the world in quality and innovation,\" Biden said in a statement late on Wednesday.\n\nThe UAW has not endorsed Biden's re-election. His administration is pouring billions in federal subsidies into expanding sales of EVs, and a shift to electric threatens UAW jobs at powertrain plants.\n\nThe union has criticized the Biden administration for subsidizing battery plants owned by joint ventures of the unionized automakers as they are not bound by contracts and pay lower wages.\n\nAbsent from the yet-to-be-ratified contract terms announced on Wednesday was any mention of future pay and unionization at new EV battery factories that Ford is building with an Asian partner.\n\n\"I think it's a success with an asterisk. In other words, successful, but with a lot of pain, heartache and damage done to get to this point,\" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said.\n\n(Reporting by Joe White and Ben Klayman in Detroit; additional reporting by Eric Cox in Detroit, Bianca Flowers in Chicago, David Shepardson in Washington, Abhirup Roy in San Francisco, Abhijith Ganapavaram in Bengaluru; Editing by Sayantani Ghosh and Devika Syamnath)", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/newsmaker-uaws-shawn-fain-snatches-200343094.html", "symbols": ["F.MX", "F.US", "FDMO34.SA", "FMC1.F", "FMC1.XETRA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": -0.15, "neg": 0.077, "neu": 0.858, "pos": 0.065}}, {"date": "2023-10-26T19:24:14+00:00", "title": "Ford, Worksport, Hyundai, Stellantis And Tesla Bring Some Much-Needed Good News From The Automotive Universe", "content": "On Thursday before the bell, Ford Motor (NYSE: F) shares\u00a0rose 3% before the bell\u00a0as it reached a tentative deal with the UAW. Shares of General Motors (NYSE: GM) also followed with a 1% rise as analysts expected the automaker to follow Ford\u2019s footsteps and end an unprecedented strike that the\u00a0consultancy Anderson Economic Group\u00a0estimated to have had an economic cost of $9.3 billon. Also today,\u00a0Stellantis (NYSE: STLA) revealed that it will be buying a 21% stake in Leapmotor, a Chinese EV maker, for $1.6 billion in attempt to revive its appeal in China.\n\nAs Ford saved its most lucrative segment from further losses, another pickup player from the automotive parts zone, Worksport Ltd (NASDAQ: WKSP) announced today its hard-folding tonneau covers\u00a0received interest from a leading Canada-based automotive aftermarket reseller.\n\nFord Ends The Strike\n\nFord and the UAW agreed upon a\u00a025% wage hike over the 4-1/2-year contract, beginning with an initial increase of 11%.\u00a0General Motors as well as Stellantis previously offered a 23% increase in wages. The ratification of 57,000 UAW workers employed at Ford will take up to 2 weeks, kicking off on October 29th, upon approval of the deal by the UAW's leadership. Ford\u2019s deal will undoubtedly serve as a template for GM and Stellantis. According to Reuters, the UAW stated that\u00a0when compounding and cost-of-living mechanisms are factored in, GM and Stellantis are in for total pay hikes of more than 33%. The agreement that Ford made reverses concsessions the union agreed to when GM, Chrysler\u00a0and Ford were desperately trying to\u00a0stay afloat. By ending the strike, Ford avoided the UAW going against its facility in Dearborn but only time will show if these concessions put it at a disadvantage against non-unionized EV makers such as Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA).\n\nHyundai Says Its EV Plans Remain On Track\n\nWhile the world eagerly awaits for Tesla to bring its Cybertruck to life, this year will end with plenty of developments on the electric pickup front. For example,\u00a0Hyundai Motor Company (OTC: HYMTF) was among the first to express its interest in Worksport\u2019s game changing solutions. Hyundai will be getting a customized version of Worksport\u2019s proprietary solar-powered pickup for its Santa Cruz pickup. Moreover, Hyundai Motor is a rare automaker who is not toning down its EV ambitions. Today, Hyundai confirmed it will not be delaying its EV plans and showed optimism for continued growth this year, which is a sharp contrast to its rivals. Considering that Hyundai Motor is not a member of the UAW and that it has been making significant effort in reducing logistics costs, its assembly plant in Alabama and EV-factory in the making in Georgia are protected from the effects of the strike.\n\nStory continues\n\nWorksport Continues Its Growth Trajectory\n\nAfter securing\u00a0$16 million USD annual sales agreement for its hard-folding and soft-folding covers with a leading U.S. aftermarket reseller earlier this year, Worksport announced today a Canada-based automotive market reseller has expressed interest in its hard-folding covers that were already sent as samples. Worksport is unable to disclose the name of private-label customers but revealed that the annual sales volume of this potential client surpass $10 billion CAD.\n\nWorksport has further fortified its position in the aftermarket and cleantech space as it continues to get closer to\u00a0the\u00a0debut of its solar-powered SOLIS Solar Cover and portable COR Battery System. This game-changing power on the go duo promise to bring additional driving range for electric pickup trucks of partnering OEM brands and providing off-grid power in remote locations.\n\nTesla Also Delivered Good News\n\nTesla also reported today it received an order from BP EV unit that ordered\u00a0$100 million worth Tesla chargers. As it gained\u00a0a new revenue stream, Tesla announced that this is\u00a0first deployment of its\u00a0chargers on an independent network.\u00a0After Tesla took a beating after a dissapointing quarterly report and the UAW embarked on an unprecedented strike against all three Detroit automakers, these developments are all good news that the automotive world needs right now.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

About 57,000 Ford workers still have to vote on the tentative pact.\n\nGM and Stellantis will have to follow the pattern set by Ford or it's likely that UAW President Shawn Fain will add factories to its partial strikes that began on Sept. 15, said Art Wheaton, director of labor studies at Cornell University.\n\n\u201cFain does not strike me as someone who is going to be willing to concede anything to the other two automakers to break the pattern,\u201d Wheaton said.\n\nAdditional strikes would be painful to the companies, especially at GM, which has profitable pickup truck plants in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and Flint, Michigan, that the union could shut down, Wheaton said.\n\nGM and Stellantis are losing money due to the strikes and they may be eager to bring them to a close, even though it's not certain whether Ford workers will ratify the contract, Wheaton said. GM said Tuesday that it's losing about $200 million per week due to the strike, which this week hit the highly profitable factory in Arlington, Texas, that makes large truck-based SUVs such as the Chevrolet Tahoe.\n\nThe Ford deal, if approved by local union leaders and ratified by members, would give top-scale assembly plant workers a 25% raise over the life of the contract. Including cost of living raises, workers would get over 30% in pay increases to over $40 per hour by the time the contract expires on April 30 of 2028. They also won pay raises and a quicker path to full-time for temporary workers, the end of some wage tiers, pension increases, and increased 401(k) contributions for those without them. Members could begin voting next week on the pact.\n\nStory continues\n\nGM is likely to be the next company to settle because it has agreed to pull new electric vehicle battery factories into the UAW's national contract, which essentially unionizes them. The UAW sees the plants as the jobs of the future in the auto industry as the nation and world transition from internal combustion engines to battery power. Workers making gasoline engines and transmissions will need a place to work when their plants are phased out.\n\nIt wasn't clear what Ford agreed to in terms of battery factories. The company has said it would be hard to unionize employees who haven\u2019t been hired yet at plants that haven't been built. Ford had announced plans to build two battery factories in Kentucky, one in Tennessee and another in Michigan, but the Michigan plant is now on hold.\n\nAll three companies have said they don\u2019t want to absorb labor costs that are so high that they would force price increases and make their vehicles more expensive than those made by nonunion companies such as Tesla and Toyota.\n\nA study this month by Moody\u2019s Investor Service found that annual labor costs could rise by $1.1 billion for Stellantis, $1.2 billion for GM and $1.4 billion for Ford in the final year of the contract. The study assumed a 20% increase in hourly labor costs.\n\nWheaton said the companies are making billions and now can afford the higher labor costs, which he estimated are 6% to 8% of the cost of a vehicle.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/general-motors-stellantis-talks-united-190459940.html", "symbols": ["8TI.F", "F.MX", "F.US", "FDMO34.SA", "FMC1.F", "FMC1.XETRA", "STLA.US"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.861, "neg": 0.03, "neu": 0.922, "pos": 0.048}}, {"date": "2023-10-26T18:38:03+00:00", "title": "Dow futures tick higher, Intel up 8%, Amazon lifts 4.4% after earnings", "content": "Investing.com - US stock futures were trading slightly higher during Thursday's evening deals, as investors parsed fresh earnings results from tech heavyweights Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC).\n\nBy 6:30pm ET (10:30pm GMT) Dow Jones Futures added 0.2%, S&P 500 Futures gained 0.4% and Nasdaq 100 Futures were up 0.8%.\n\nIn extended deals, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) gained 4.4% after reporting Q3 EPS of $0.94 versus $0.58 expected while revenues came in at $143.1 billion versus $141.53 billion expected.

Macroeconomic headwinds have impacted growth, and several EV companies have found it challenging to grow as competition intensifies. Amid mixed sentiments, several cheap EV stocks are still worth considering.\n\nAn important point is that there are intermediate corrections even in industries with positive tailwinds. The EV industry is still in early growth due to its penetration into different markets. For 2023, EV sales are expected to be 18% of global car sales. Further, by 2030, EV sales will likely increase to 60% of total sales. In the next five to ten years, there will be massive value creators like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).\n\nThese three EV stocks under $10 are attractive. Two of these stocks represent companies in early growth stages. If business developments remain positive, these stocks can deliver multibagger returns.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPanasonic Holdings (PCRFY) A Panasonic (PCRFY) sign hanging in Beijing, China. generation z\n\nSource: testing/Shutterstock.com\n\nPanasonic Holdings (OTCMKTS:PCRFY) is the top name among EV stocks under $10 to buy and hold. PCRFY stock has trended higher by 17% year-to-date. However, valuations remain attractive, considering a forward price-earnings ratio of 8. Further, the stock provides a dividend yield of 1.1%.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Panasonic is pursuing aggressive business expansion. This is a key reason to be bullish. To put things into perspective, the company is targeting EV battery capacity of 200GWh by 2031. This would imply a quadrupling of capacity compared to past financial years. Capacity expansion will translate into robust revenue and cash flow growth.\n\nBesides aggressive expansion, Panasonic is also investing in innovation. The company claims to have developed a way to slow battery degradation. Additionally, Panasonic is targeting a 20% jump in battery density by 2030. This would imply smaller and lighter EV batteries.\n\nPolestar Automotive (PSNY) A Polestar (PSNY) sign at the area at Polestar powerstop in Mj\u00f6lby.\n\nSource: Jeppe Gustafsson / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nPolestar Automotive (NASDAQ:PSNY) is among the most undervalued EV stocks under $10. After a correction of 54% in the last 12 months, PSNY stock seems poised for a comeback in 2024.\n\nThe first reason to be bullish on Polestar is the potential acceleration in car deliveries next year. In December, the company will commence commercial sales of Polestar 4 in China. Further, Polestar 5 is due for commercial launch next year. These two models will ensure robust delivery growth in the next 12 to 24 months.\n\nThe second reason to be positive on PSNY stock is cost cutting. Cash burn has been challenging and Polestar has initiated cost-cutting measures to reduce losses in EBITDA. This, coupled with operating leverage, is likely to translate into a healthier EBITDA margin next year. With a cash buffer of $1 billion, the company is well positioned to navigate cash burn in the next few quarters.\n\nSolid Power (SLDP) Smartphone with logo of American battery company Solid Power Inc. on screen in front of business website. Focus on center-left of phone display.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSolid Power (NASDAQ:SLDP) is another name among cheap EV stocks to buy and hold. After a 75% correction in the last 12 months, SLDP stock trades at $1.4. Assuming a scenario where the company commercializes solid-state batteries, the stock is poised for 20x to 30x returns from current levels.\n\nOne reason to like Solid Power is that the stock is not speculative. Automotive giants that include Ford (NYSE:F) and BMW (OTCMKTS:BMWYY) back the company. BMW is conducting parallel research and development after Solid Power licensed its technology to the former.\n\nIn terms of business development, Solid Power expects to deliver A-sample EV cells to automotive partners in 2023. This is an important development, as positive news from validation testing can be a key stock upside catalyst.\n\nSolid Power is also well positioned from a financial perspective. As of Q2 2023, the company reported cash and equivalents of $443 million. There is ample financial flexibility to invest in R&D in the next 24 months.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

How long does it take after a strike this long and so targeted to get a lot of these production lines back up and running?\n\nGREG MIGLIORE: So from what I've heard, some of the Ford factories are already-- people are going back to them like today. So Ford, General Motors, Stellantis have been making cars and trucks and SUVs for close to 100 years, more than that in Ford's case. They know what they're doing. And it's actually somewhat of a reasonable task to just restart production. So that's going to, I think, happen in pretty short order. I think going forward, both sides will have clear-structured labor costs for the next 4 and 1/2 years.\n\nI think they'll have some clarity. We don't know all of the details of the agreement, but we'll get some more clarity on what battery plants might be included into it. And frankly, this is about to be over with, I think. It's one of those things where you look back at the 2019 General Motors strike, which was almost all-- which was all General Motors factories, this what it seems like accomplished a bit more for the union.\n\n- Certainly for that, at least laying out the blueprint for the other two to follow.

The results also come as cross-town rival GM reported strong earnings, but pulled its guidance due to the labor stoppages.\n\nFor the quarter, Ford is expected to report top-line revenue of $41.21 billion, which would be a nearly 11% improvement from a year ago, but a dip from the $45.0 billion reported in Q2. Ford is also expected to post adjusted EPS of $0.47, and adjusted net income of $1.874 billion.\n\nLast quarter, Ford raised its full-year 2023 guidance for adjusted EBIT to between $11 billion and $12 billion, and also lifted its adjusted free cash flow forecast to between $6.5 billion and $7 billion. Whether it keeps this forecast or adjusts in light of a labor deal being reached will be key to the results.\n\nGM (GM) said this week labor uncertainty necessitated its forecast be withdrawn, due to uncertainty brought on by the UAW and president Shawn Fain\u2019s stand-up strike strategy.\n\nJPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman estimates the costs of the labor strike in Q3 to be approximately $145 million for Ford. GM reported the strikes cost the company $200 million in Q3, and $800 million in pre-tax earnings since the strikes began on Nov. 15.\n\nThe UAW said its tentative agreement with Ford includes a 25% base wage increase through April 2028 and will cumulatively raise the top wage by over 30% to more than $40 an hour and raise the starting wage by 68%, to over $28 an hour. The lowest-paid workers at Ford will see a raise of more than 150% over the life of the agreement, with some workers receiving an 85% increase immediately upon ratification.\n\nThe UAW also revealed COLA (cost-of-living allowance) provisions were reinstated, along with a new three-year wage progression scale (previously it was eight years), as well as the end of wage tiers. The union said it secured gains for workers with pensions and 401(k) plans but did not reveal specifics.\n\nStory continues\n\nLabor deal aside, Q3 will also mark the third time Ford reports performance across its three main business lines \u2014 Ford Blue for gas-powered cars, Ford Model e for its EV business, and Ford Pro for its commercial and Super Duty trucks business. Bloomberg estimates the following for those units:\n\nFord Blue\n\nRevenue: $23.93 billion EBIT: $1.94 billion Ford Model e\n\nRevenue: $2.34 billion EBIT loss: $1.27 billion Ford Pro\n\nRevenue: $14.65 billion EBIT: $2.16 billion\n\nNote for its Model e EV business, Ford projected a $4.5 billion loss for the unit in 2023. Ford may update this figure given additional price cuts it has initiated for both the F-150 Lighting EV pickup and Mustang Mach-E electric SUV.\n\nEarlier this month Ford reported US Q3 sales of 500,504 units, up 7.7% from a year ago, powered by F-Series truck sales, which rose 13.4% compared to Q3 last year. Ford noted that hybrid sales jumped 41.4%, and EV sales also climbed 14.8%.\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. Therefore, if you purchase Ford Motor's shares on or after the 31st of October, you won't be eligible to receive the dividend, when it is paid on the 1st of December.\n\nThe company's next dividend payment will be US$0.15 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$0.60 to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Ford Motor has a trailing yield of approximately 5.2% on its current stock price of $11.54. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. So we need to investigate whether Ford Motor can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Ford Motor\n\nDividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Ford Motor paid out more than half (58%) of its earnings last year, which is a regular payout ratio for most companies. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether Ford Motor generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. It paid out 94% of its free cash flow in the form of dividends last year, which is outside the comfort zone for most businesses. Cash flows are usually much more volatile than earnings, so this could be a temporary effect - but we'd generally want to look more closely here.\n\nFord Motor paid out less in dividends than it reported in profits, but unfortunately it didn't generate enough cash to cover the dividend. Were this to happen repeatedly, this would be a risk to Ford Motor's ability to maintain its dividend.\n\nStory continues\n\nClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends. historic-dividend\n\nHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?\n\nWhen earnings decline, dividend companies become much harder to analyse and own safely. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. Ford Motor's earnings per share have fallen at approximately 12% a year over the previous five years. Such a sharp decline casts doubt on the future sustainability of the dividend.\n\nThe main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, Ford Motor has lifted its dividend by approximately 4.1% a year on average. Growing the dividend payout ratio while earnings are declining can deliver nice returns for a while, but it's always worth checking for when the company can't increase the payout ratio any more - because then the music stops.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nShould investors buy Ford Motor for the upcoming dividend? It's definitely not great to see earnings per share shrinking. The company paid out an acceptable percentage of its income, but an uncomfortably high percentage of its cash flow over the past year. It's not an attractive combination from a dividend perspective, and we're inclined to pass on this one for the time being.\n\nWith that in mind though, if the poor dividend characteristics of Ford Motor don't faze you, it's worth being mindful of the risks involved with this business. We've identified 3 warning signs with Ford Motor (at least 1 which is potentially serious), and understanding them should be part of your investment process.\n\nGenerally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

UAW President Shawn Fain characterized the deal as an \u201chistoric agreement\u201d on day 40 of the union\u2019s stand-up strike.\n\nYahoo Finance Autos Reporter Pras Subramanian details what this could mean for the automaker ahead of Ford's reporting third-quarter earnings on Thursday.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nSEANA SMITH: The UAW and Ford have tentatively reached an agreement after nearly six weeks of strikes. Now, the union saying that the deal includes 25% wage increases over the course of four years, adjustments for cost of living, and the right to strike over plant closures. Negotiations still continue between the United Auto Workers Union and General Motors and Stellantis. UAW President Shawn Fain called the deal a, quote, \"historic agreement.\"\n\nSHAWN FAIN: Ford knew what was coming for them on Wednesday if we didn't get a deal. That was checkmate. On day 40 of the stand-up strike, we reached a historic agreement.\n\nSEANA SMITH: Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian joining us now with the latest. Pras, we just heard Shawn Fain saying checkmate, a historic agreement. What's in the-- what do we know more about just what's in this deal and then the next steps here over the coming days?\n\nPRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Hey, Seana. So, yeah, interesting with that quote you just played. What he was alluding to was before checkmate was that they were potentially going to strike the F-150 Lightning plant. That was supposedly the next step. And I guess that was enough to sort of prompt Ford to reach this deal.\n\nSo anyway, some of the big sort of parts of this deal are, you mentioned that, 25% base wage increase through 2028 through the end of the deal, 30% increases in the top wage, a 68% raise in starting pay, also shortening the wage progression to three years to get to that top wage, and also the reinstatement of COLA, or Cost Of Living Adjustments, among other things.\n\nStory continues\n\nFord said it was pleased to reach a deal and to focus on restarting their plants. And Shawn Fain also saying that we-- quote, \"We won things nobody thought possible. This agreement sets us on a new path to make things right at Ford, the Big 3, and across the auto industry.\"\n\nNow, the deal still needs to be voted on by the UAW Ford National Council. Then it goes to members for a vote, perhaps a week from now. And then some Wall Street reaction, initial reaction is good. Our good friend Dan Ives saying that was a balanced deal and that he expects to see other deals struck with Stellantis and GM in the next week or so.\n\nBRAD SMITH: Yeah, this is really interesting process, especially given the timing, UAW clearly recognizing, all right, Ford has its back up against the wall. It's about to report earnings. It could come out and have to issue some of the same statements that GM did, or it could strike a deal right before that. Do you feel like Ford felt like they were painted into a corner here and ultimately wanted to give investors some clarity about where they were willing to and ready to move forward?\n\nPRAS SUBRAMANIAN: You know, Brad, it's probably a little bit of both there, right? So they're pushed against the wall, potential strike at that F-150 plant, earnings today. But from a timing point of view-- I was thinking about this earlier-- this is such a good thing for Ford.\n\nRight ahead of earnings, they're able to say this deal is struck, talk about it tonight in the call, see-- say what the implications are, maybe keep their guidance, which GM had to pull. And that was sort of a black eye for them, among other things, this week. So it's almost like a big win for Ford over its crosstown rival GM, as it hit the deal.\n\nIt's probably going to keep its guidance, or at least tweak it slightly, and say that, hey, we're done. We're going to get this vote out and hopefully-- hopefully the members ratify it and workers go back to the plants. It can't be said yet for GM and Stellantis. But I think that they have at least have a model template to work with, and we'll probably see these other two deals happen very shortly.\n\nBRAD SMITH: All right, we're going to be watching that very closely, as we know you will as well, Pras. Tracking ticker symbol F here on the day here, premarket and as of right now, we're just taking a look at shares that are up by about 2.7%. We'll continue to keep a close eye on that moving forward here as we get closer to the start of today's trading activity.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/video/ford-uaw-tentative-labor-deal-131956189.html", "symbols": ["F.MX", "F.US", "FDMO34.SA", "FMC1.F", "FMC1.XETRA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.997, "neg": 0.019, "neu": 0.876, "pos": 0.105}}, {"date": "2023-10-26T13:18:42+00:00", "title": "Ford shares rise a day after tentative deal with UAW", "content": "(Reuters) - Ford shares rose slightly on Thursday as the company's unionized workers were set to return to work following a tentative agreement between the automaker and the United Auto Workers (UAW) union guaranteeing a record wage hike.\n\nRival General Motors' shares also rose as analysts expected the automaker to follow Ford in reaching a deal that would end a strike at some of its most profitable plants.\n\nThe total economic loss from the autoworkers' strike has reached $9.3 billon, consultancy Anderson Economic Group said earlier this week.\n\nThe proposed deal between Ford and the UAW provides a 25% wage hike over the 4-1/2-year contract, starting with an initial increase of 11%.\n\nGM and Stellantis have previously offered a 23% wage increase.\n\nStellantis' U.S.-listed shares were down 1.5% in premarket trading on Thursday as the automaker announced a $1.6 billion deal to buy a 21% stake in electric-vehicle maker Leapmotor.\n\nFord and GM shares trade 6.2 times and 4.3 times forward profit estimates, respectively.\n\nThe focus will now be on ratification by Ford's 57,000 UAW workers.\n\n\"We estimate the ratification will take 1-2 weeks.

Ives believes a deal between the union, GM, and Stellantis will likely get done over the next week.\n\nIn terms of next steps, Fain said the UAW\u2019s national council for Ford would vote on Sunday to determine whether to send the deal to UAW membership. After informational meetings with local UAW members, the deal would then be sent for a full vote.\n\nLast but not least, Ford will report Q3 earnings Thursday night after the bell. Ford leadership is expected to discuss more details regarding the financial impact of the agreement and any changes to its profit guidance after reaching a tentative deal with the union.\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

This four-and-a-half-year contract, pending approval by union leaders and members, marks a historic achievement in the ongoing labor disputes involving 45,000 workers at Ford, General Motors GM, and Stellantis (Chrysler-parent) since September 15.\n\nUnder the proposed agreement, Ford workers can anticipate a 25% wage hike over the duration of the contract. Immediate gains include an 11% wage hike. When considering compounding and the cost of living adjustments, the overall worker pay is expected to soar by approximately 33%, reaching beyond $40 an hour over the contract's lifespan.\n\nFord's Agreement Paves the Way for GM and Stellantis\n\nThe UAW's success in reaching a tentative agreement with Ford carries broader implications for the entire automotive industry. UAW President Shawn Fain has urged Ford workers to return to work promptly to exert pressure on General Motors and Stellantis to reach their own settlements.\n\nIf ratified by Ford workers, this contract is expected to set the standard for future negotiations at General Motors and Stellantis, effectively shaping the labor landscape until April 30, 2028.\n\nEconomic Impact and Stock Market Response\n\nThe strike, which has persisted for six weeks, has had a substantial economic impact. Estimates suggest total losses stemming from the auto workers' strike have reached a staggering $9.3 billion. This includes disrupted production and supply chain disruptions, affecting various sectors of the economy.\n\nFurthermore, the stock market has reacted to this development, as General Motors shares slumped about 10% past month. General Motors withdrew its 2023 profit outlook. The company attributed this decision to the rising costs associated with the UAW strikes. Notably, the strike is estimated to have cost General Motors approximately $200 million during the September quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nETF in Focus\n\nFirst Trust NASDAQ Transportation ETF (FTXR)\n\nThe Nasdaq US Smart Transportation Index is a modified factor weighted index, designed to provide exposure to US companies within the transportation industry. Ford Motors has 8.53% exposure to the fund and also contains the first spot. General Motors Company too has about 7.8% in the fund. The fund charges 60 bps in fees. The fund is off about 7% past month.\n\nBottom Line\n\nIn conclusion, the tentative labor agreement between Ford and the UAW represents a significant breakthrough in the ongoing labor disputes within the automotive industry. It sets the stage for potential resolutions with General Motors and Stellantis as well. However, the strike's economic impact and its effect on the stock market has far-reaching consequences. For the near term, we expect a turnaround in the auto ETF.\n\n(Disclaimer: This article has been written with the assistance of Generative AI.

The European Central Bank is expected to halt its rate-hiking cycle, while investors will also focus on the latest quarterly U.S. growth numbers ahead of next week's Federal Reserve meeting.\n\n1. Meta Platforms falls on revenue guidance; Amazon next up\n\nIt was the turn of Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) to take the spotlight after the close of trading on Wednesday, as the Facebook and Instagram owner beat expectations for third-quarter profit and revenue, helped by an austerity drive and a recovery in digital advertising ahead of the holiday season.\n\nMeta's operating margin in the third quarter doubled to 40%, while revenue grew at its quickest pace in two years.\n\nAdditionally, CEO Mark Zuckerberg stated that Meta is now moving into artificial technology, following the lead of rivals Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), adding AI would constitute Meta's biggest investment area in 2024.\n\nHowever, Meta\u2019s stock fell over 3% premarket as investors fretted over the company\u2019s guidance for the fourth quarter revenue, with the $38.3 billion estimate coming in 1.6% below expectations.\n\nEarnings from the important tech sector continue Thursday, with e-commerce and cloud computing giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) expected to report earnings per share of 58 cents on revenue of $141.5 billion, after the close.\n\nInvestors will look for signs that Amazon's aggressive expansion of same-day delivery services helped increase its third-quarter profit margin by spurring shoppers to place more frequent and bigger orders.\n\n2. Futures fall as the earnings season continues\n\nU.S. stock futures dropped Thursday, continuing the previous session\u2019s selloff with earnings from a series of tech giants driving sentiment.\n\nAt 04:40 ET (08:40 GMT), the Dow futures contract dropped 115 points or 0.3%, S&P 500 futures fell by 26 points or 0.6%, and Nasdaq 100 futures slipped by 140 points or 1%.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe major indices closed sharply lower Wednesday, as Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) miss on revenue expectations from its cloud operations hit the tech sector, in particular, very hard.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 2.4%, recording its worst day since February, while the broad-based S&P 500 dropped 1.4% and the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3%.\n\nThe earnings deluge continues Thursday, with results due from e-commerce giant Amazon the highlight [see above].\n\nNumbers are also due from the likes of pharmaceutical giant Merck (NYSE:MRK), carrier Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), auto giant Ford (NYSE:F) and Mexican fast food chain Chipotle (NYSE:CMG).\n\nThere are a number of economic indicators due Thursday, headlined by the first reading of third quarter gross domestic product [see below].\n\nSeptember durable goods orders, goods trade deficit, wholesale and retail inventory numbers and weekly initial jobless claims will be published at the same time as the GDP report.\n\n3. ECB to pause lengthy hiking streak\n\nThe European Central Bank meets later Thursday, and is widely expected to pause its rate-hiking cycle after raising interest rates at its past 10 meetings.\n\nThe central bank hiked its key interest rates by 25 basis points, taking the deposit rate to 4.00% and the refinancing rate to 4.50%, but signaled its 14-month-long hiking streak was likely to be its last.\n\nA weakening eurozone economy suggests the need for further tightening is limited, with Germany, Europe's largest economy, likely entering a recession this quarter.\n\nHowever, inflation, while slowing, remains above the ECB\u2019s medium-term target. Additionally, the conflict in the Middle East is pushing energy prices higher, creating another headwind.\n\n\"The biggest challenge will be to keep a balancing act -- not sound aggressively hawkish but keep the door open to rate hikes,\" said ING's global head of macro Carsten Brzeski.\n\n4. U.S. GDP seen rising strongly\n\nThe Federal Reserve policymakers get together next week, and they will have fresh data to consider, including the first reading of third quarter gross domestic product, due out later in the session.\n\nGDP is expected to have increased at a 4.3% annualized rate in the last quarter, which would be the fastest since the fourth quarter of 2021, and far sharper than the 2.1% pace seen in the April-June quarter.\n\nThis expected lift in growth will likely come from a boost in consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, which has been supported by a strong labor market.\n\nHowever, the Fed is likely to keep interest rates unchanged at its Oct. 31-Nov. 1 policy meeting, even with a strong GDP number, as financial conditions have already tightened with U.S. Treasury yields surging.\n\n5. Crude slips lower as U.S. inventories rise\n\nCrude prices edged lower Thursday, giving up some of the previous session\u2019s gains as U.S. oil stocks rose while traders continued to focus on developments in the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nBy 04:40 ET, the U.S. crude futures traded 0.7% lower at $84.72 a barrel, while the Brent contract dropped 0.6% to $89.56 a barrel.\n\nThe benchmark contracts settled nearly 2% higher on Wednesday, but have since fallen back after the Wall Street Journal reported that Israel has agreed to delay an expected invasion of Gaza for now.\n\nU.S. crude inventories climbed by 1.4 million barrels last week, according to data from the Energy Information Administration, released Wednesday, pointing to weakening demand at the world\u2019s largest consumer.\n\nHowever, trading remains volatile, as traders struggle to gauge whether the war would escalate and disrupt crude supplies in the oil-rich Middle East region.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAmazon, U.S. GDP, ECB rate decision - what's moving markets\n\nWith House speaker installed, US Congress returns to spending battles\n\nExclusive-TikTok, YouTube, Meta eye Indonesia e-commerce licenses- sources", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-u-gdp-ecb-rate-043447614.html", "symbols": ["AMZ.F", "AMZ.XETRA", "AMZN.MX", "AMZN.US", "AMZO34.SA", "CMG.US", "DJI.INDX", "F.US", "FB2A.F", "FB2A.XETRA", "GOOG.US", "GOOGL.US", "IXIC.INDX", "LUV.US", "META.US", "MRK.US", "MSFT.US"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": -0.968, "neg": 0.088, "neu": 0.832, "pos": 0.08}}, {"date": "2023-10-26T02:46:06+00:00", "title": "UAW, Ford Reach a Tentative Agreement", "content": "United Auto Workers (UAW) announced that it has reached a \"tentative agreement\" with automaker Ford Motor Co.

With cost-of-living allowances, the top wage rate is expected to increase by 33%. The top pay will be over $40 an hour, the union said.\n\nUAW leadership will vote on the deal Oct. 29. It then must be ratified by Ford\u2019s 57,000 US hourly workers, a process that could take weeks.\n\n\u201cWe won things nobody thought was possible,\u201d said UAW President Shawn Fain Wednesday night in a video posted on X. \u201cSince the strike began, Ford put 50% more on the table.\u201d\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, President Joe Biden highlighted \u201cworker power\u201d when congratulating Ford and the union on reaching a deal.\n\nPay was one of the last issues to be ironed out during the talks. The union had originally sought a 40% raise and 32-hour work week before reining in its demands. Ford earlier agreed to cost-of-living allowances, converting temp hires to full-time and expediting how long it takes workers to get to the top wage rate.\n\nLeft out of Wednesday\u2019s announcement were details on key issues including wages and benefits at battery plants and Fain\u2019s initial demand for a 32-hour workweek.\n\nFain did not address whether the tentative agreement covers Ford\u2019s four battery plants that are under construction or helps the UAW organize the new electric truck assembly plant the automaker is building in Tennessee.\n\nStory continues\n\nRival Deals\n\nGeneral Motors Co. and Stellantis NV are set to meet with the UAW on Thursday and the union hopes they will agree to the same terms, according to people familiar with the talks who weren\u2019t authorized to speak publicly.\n\nThe UAW told Ford workers to go back to work during the ratification process to \u201ckeep the pressure on Stellantis and GM,\u201d said Chuck Browning, the union\u2019s top Ford negotiator.\n\n\u201cThe last thing they want is for Ford to get back to full capacity while they mess around and lag behind,\u201d Browning said in the video.\n\nGM and Stellantis said in separate emailed statements that they\u2019re working with the UAW to reach agreements \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d\n\nFord said it was \u201cpleased\u201d to reach a deal with the UAW and restart its plants, \u201ccalling 20,000 Ford employees back to work and shipping our full lineup to our customers again,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\nLost Earnings\n\nThe strike that began Sept. 15 initially affected one vehicle-assembly plant at each of Detroit\u2019s legacy automakers. It was the first time all three companies were targeted at once \u2014 a bet by Fain to keep them guessing about his next move. Within six weeks, the strike grew to include more than 45,000 workers at eight assembly plants and 38 parts-distribution facilities.\n\nAfter the UAW launched a surprise walkout at Ford\u2019s highly profitable Kentucky Truck Plant on Oct. 11, it announced that it was switching up its strategy to call strikes with little notice, which it said was a response to companies slow-walking talks before making any substantial offers.\n\nTwo more surprise strikes followed: at Stellantis\u2019 Sterling Heights, Michigan, plant that makes its best-selling Ram 1500 pickup truck on Oct. 23; and GM\u2019s Arlington, Texas, facility assembling the Chevy Tahoe, GMC Yukon and Cadillac Escalade on Oct. 24.\n\nFain suggested that a bigger strike was in store for Ford if it hadn\u2019t reached an agreement.\n\n\u201cFord knew what was coming on Wednesday if we didn\u2019t get a deal. That was checkmate,\u201d Fain said in the video on X.\n\nThe strike was estimated to cost GM, Ford and Stellantis about $2.1 billion in lost earnings before interest and taxes as of Oct. 23, according to Deutsche Bank analyst Emmanuel Rosner. GM this week pulled its earnings guidance after the strike muddied its outlook.\n\nShares of GM and Ford have seen steep declines since July and are underperforming the S&P 500 this year. Stellantis is an outlier with its US shares up 33% so far in 2023.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says:\n\n\u201cFord\u2019s tentative labor agreement with the UAW may increase its costs by more than $900 million in its first year, based on an 11% raise in year one, putting additional pressure on the company\u2019s efforts to enhance its mediocre profitability.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Joel Levington, BI Director of Credit Research\n\nFord\u2019s UAW Deal May Cost $900 Million; S&P to Act? Credit React\n\nHigh-Stakes Bet\n\nFain made a high-stakes bet that he could win back benefits forfeited during the financial crisis more than a decade ago. The union has about 147,000 members at the three automakers, and they\u2019ve been eager to share in soaring corporate profits as car prices have surged in the four years since the last contract was signed.\n\nIf approved, the contract could be of historic proportions. A Bloomberg Law review of the last 10 contracts between the Big Three automakers and the UAW show that raises in that period never topped 3% in a single year. In fact, for 21 of the 36 years covered under these earlier contracts, workers received no annual wage increase at all.\n\nThe UAW strategy reflects a resurgence of labor activism in the US. Emboldened by tight labor markets and agitated by inflation and risks shouldered during the pandemic, unionized workers have notched a series of victories in the last year at prominent US companies, including Kaiser Permanente and United Parcel Service Inc.\n\n\u201cThis agreement sets us on a new path to set things right at Ford, at the Big Three and across the auto industry,\u201d Fain said.\n\n--With assistance from Jennifer Jacobs, Robert Combs \"Bob\" and Anne Cronin.\n\n(Updates with context throughout.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nX, One Year Later: How Elon Musk Made a Mess of Twitter\u2019s Business Venezuela\u2019s Primary Sweep Puts Maduro and Biden in the Hot Seat No One Understands Corporate Boycotts Like This Former Trump Researcher Lululemon\u2019s Founder Is Racing to Cure the Rare Disease Destroying His Muscles Inflation Raging at 130% Is Pushing Argentina Down a Radical Path\n\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-uaw-reach-tentative-deal-235436345.html", "symbols": ["F.MX", "F.US", "FDMO34.SA", "FMC1.F", "FMC1.XETRA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.986, "neg": 0.069, "neu": 0.833, "pos": 0.099}}, {"date": "2023-10-26T01:31:19+00:00", "title": "Instant view: Ford reaches tentative deal with striking UAW workers", "content": "(Reuters) - Ford Motor and United Auto Workers (UAW) union negotiators reached a tentative labor deal after a six-week strike, UAW President Shawn Fain said on Wednesday, agreeing on a 4-1/2-year contract that would provide a record pay boost.\n\nThe union is still in striking GM and Stellantis.\n\nFollowing are reactions to the tentative deal:\n\nSAM FIORANI, VP OF GLOBAL VEHICLE FORECASTING, AUTOFORECAST SOLUTIONS\n\n\"This lays the groundwork for the next two contracts and they should fall in line fairly quickly because all three were within a narrow gap of each other.\"\n\n\"The strike so far has been painful for everybody and knowing what it takes to get a signed contract should bring them to the table much quicker.\"\n\nJOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT\n\n\"I applaud the UAW and Ford for coming together after a hard fought, good faith negotiation and reaching a historic tentative agreement tonight.

The deal is the first reached between the union and one of the Detroit Three automakers. Since first striking on Sept. 15, more than 45,000 union members working at Ford, General Motors and Chrysler parent Stellantis have joined the picket lines. Here is a timeline of events beginning with the election of Fain in March: Date Development March 25 Shawn Fain wins the race for UAW president; vows to take a tough stance against the Big Three automakers. July 10 The union says it will open contract talks with Detroit's Big Three automakers starting July 13. July 11 Fain says the union is not afraid to hold a strike at any of the automakers without a fair contract. July 19 Fain meets President Joe Biden at the White House as the union briefs the staff on contract talks with the automakers. Aug. 1 The UAW presents demands to Stellantis, says the union is seeking ambitious benefit increases from the Detroit Three, including double-digit pay rises and defined-benefit pensions for all workers. Aug. 2 The union presents contract demands to General Motors. Aug. 3 The union presents contract demands to Ford Aug. 8 Fain angrily tosses contract proposals from Stellantis in a trash can, citing numerous concessions that the Chrysler parent is seeking in labor talks. Aug. 25 The UAW says 97% of voting members were in favor of authorizing a strike at the Detroit Three if an agreement is not reached before Sept. 14. Aug. 31 The union says it has filed unfair labor practice charges with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) against GM and Stellantis, saying they have refused to bargain in good faith. Aug. 31 Ford makes a contract offer to the UAW, providing hourly employees with 15% guaranteed combined wage increases, lump-sum payments and improved benefits over the life of the contract. Sept. 1 The NLRB says it will investigate the charges filed by the UAW. Sept 6 The UAW makes a labor contract counterproposal on economic issues to Ford. Sept. 7 GM makes a counteroffer to the UAW that includes a 10% wage hike and two additional 3% annual lump-sum payments over four years. Fain calls the offer \"insulting.\" Sept. 8 Stellantis says it offered U.S. hourly workers a 14.5% wage hike over four years but no lump-sum payments. Sept. 8 Fain says UAW expects to go on strike against all three automakers the following week if they do not improve their contract offers. Sept. 11 Stellantis says it plans to make a new counteroffer to the UAW after the union made its own revised offer on Sunday ahead of the expiration of the current four-year labor deal Thursday night. Sept. 13 The UAW rejects counteroffers from the automakers and outlined plans for strikes targeting individual U.S. auto plants in what would be its first-ever simultaneous strike against the Detroit Three. Sept. 15 The UAW launches simultaneous strikes that will halt production of some popular models at three factories owned by GM, Ford and Stellantis. Sept. 16 Negotiators for the UAW and Ford have \"reasonably productive discussions\" toward a new contract, while officials at Stellantis say a proposal to resume work at an idled Illinois factory has fallen through. Sept. 18 UAW says it will announce strikes at more plants on Sept. 22 if no serious progress is made in talks. Sept. 20 UAW says 90 workers go on strike at Mercedes-supplier ZF's plant in Alabama. Sept. 22 UAW will expand its strikes against GM and Stellantis, but has made real progress in talks with Ford Motor, the union says. Sept 24. Ford says despite progress in some areas, it still has \"significant gaps to close\" on key economic issues before it can reach a new labor agreement with UAW. Sept. 28 The UAW makes a new counter-proposal to Stellantis, just one day before it was set to strike at additional Detroit Three facilities. Sept. 29 The UAW will walk off the job at an additional plant at General Motors and at Ford, says Fain. The new strike will not extend to Stellantis, which called before the scheduled 10 a.m. ET announcement to make significant changes in its contract proposal. Oct.2 GM and Ford say they are laying off another 500 workers at four Midwestern plants. Separately, the UAW confirms it presented a new contract offer to GM. GM says it has received the counterproposal \"but significant gaps remain.\" Oct. 3 Ford says it had made a new contract offer but says a dispute over battery plants remained unresolved. Ford says the new offer boosts wages for temporary workers, increases company 401(k) contributions and further shrinks time needed to get to the top wage rate. Oct. 6 The UAW holds off on additional strikes against Detroit Three auto plants, citing GM's unexpected willingness to allow workers at joint-venture battery plants to be covered by union contracts. Oct. 11 GM, Ford and Stellantis all agree to raise base wages by between 20% and 23% over a four-year deal. Ford and Stellantis agree to reinstate cost-of-living adjustments, or COLA. Oct. 12 The UAW shuts down Ford's biggest plant globally, saying the automaker refused to move further in bargaining. UAW negotiators are expected to turn their attention to talks with Stellantis. Oct. 13 Fain says the union will not expand its strike at the moment, but warns that members would now walk out of additional facilities without warning rather than wait until Fridays to announce new plans. Oct. 13 A senior Ford executive says the automaker is \"at the limit\" of what it can spend on higher wages and benefits for the UAW. Stellantis and Ford say they will temporarily lay off 1,250 employees due to the impact of the UAW strike. Oct. 16 Ford executive chairman Bill Ford urges the UAW union to end a 32-day strike and reach a new labor agreement, and warns of the growing impact to the automaker and the U.S. economy. Oct. 20 General Motors and Stellantis raise their offer to striking auto workers, matching Ford's proposed 23% wage hike. Fain says \"there is more to be won.\" Oct. 23 An additional 6,800 UAW members go on strike at Stellantis's largest assembly plant. Oct. 24 General Motors withdraws its 2023 profit outlook just ahead of a new UAW walkout at its Arlington, Texas, factory. The UAW and Ford announce a Oct. 25 tentative agreement on a labor deal that will last 4-1/2 years and provide a record pay increase.

If they fail to organize the other companies and the differential causes jobs to go out of Detroit and to the other companies, then he's a failure,\" Scharf said.\n\n(Reporting by Mrinmay Dey and Shivani Jayesh Tanna in Bengaluru; Writing by Peter Henderson and Sayantani Ghosh; Additional reporting by Abhirup Roy; Editing by Cynthia Osterman and Christopher Cushing)", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-uaw-negotiators-reach-labor-231622814.html", "symbols": ["F.MX", "F.US", "FDMO34.SA", "FMC1.F", "FMC1.XETRA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.992, "neg": 0.042, "neu": 0.87, "pos": 0.087}}, {"date": "2023-10-25T22:58:00+00:00", "title": "UAW, Ford Expected to Announce New Tentative Labor Deal", "content": "The United Auto Workers union is expected to announce a new tentative labor contract with the automaker, according to people with knowledge of the talks.\n\nContinue reading", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/m/7fd8876b-7b43-3322-adc3-cb6b6c755c77/uaw%2C-ford-expected-to.html", "symbols": ["F.MX", "F.US", "FDMO34.SA", "FMC1.F", "FMC1.XETRA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.422, "neg": 0, "neu": 0.899, "pos": 0.101}}, {"date": "2023-10-25T21:24:48+00:00", "title": "Amazon and Ford earnings, U.S. GDP: What to Watch", "content": "Yahoo Finance Live anchor Josh Lipton previews the top industry headlines for Thursday, October 26, including Amazon (AMZN) and Ford (F) earnings among many others, as well as the latest reading of the U.S. Gross Domestic Product.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/video/amazon-ford-earnings-u-gdp-212448753.html", "symbols": ["6MK.F", "6MK.XETRA", "AMZ.F", "AMZ.XETRA", "AMZN.MX", "AMZN.US", "AMZO34.SA", "BBEA.F", "C9F.F", "CMCS34.SA", "CMCSA.MX", "CMCSA.US", "CMG.MX", "CMG.US", "CTP2.F", "DP5.F", "F.MX", "F.US", "FDMO34.SA", "FMC1.F"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.128, "neg": 0.05, "neu": 0.859, "pos": 0.091}}, {"date": "2023-10-25T21:11:00+00:00", "title": "The UAW Strike Is 40 Days Old, Matching 2019.

Previously Ford, Stellantis and General Motors had all offered 23% pay increases.\n\nA Ford deal would include cost-of-living pay increases that could lift the total pay raises above 30%, said the people, who asked not to be identified because they are not authorized to speak publicly about the talks. In addition, workers would still receive annual profit-sharing checks.\n\nIt's still possible that the negotiations, despite the meaningful progress being made, could unravel. But if the UAW can reach a tentative agreement with Ford, it would be used as a model to seek similar contract settlements with GM and Stellantis. Typically, during past auto strikes, a UAW deal with one automaker has led the other companies to match it with their own settlements.\n\nOne of the people said there also was progress in the union\u2019s talks with GM. But it was unclear whether any of the automakers had accepted the UAW\u2019s counter-offer of 25% pay increases over four years.\n\nThe progress in the negotiations came after the union this week walked out at three factories that produce highly profitable pickup trucks and SUVs, adding them to the list of plants already on strike in a strategy to intensify pressure on the companies.\n\nOn Tuesday, about 5,000 workers at GM\u2019s assembly plant in Arlington, Texas, walked out, halting production of truck-based SUVs that are huge profit makers for the company. A day earlier, the UAW\u2019s president, Shawn Fain, had added 6,800 employees at Stellantis\u2019 Ram pickup plant in Sterling Heights, Michigan.\n\nStory continues\n\nTwo weeks ago the union struck Ford\u2019s largest and most profitable factory, the Kentucky Truck Plant in Louisville, where 8,700 workers make heavy-duty F-Series pickups and two large SUVs.\n\nIn all, about 46,000 workers have walked out at factories owned by the three companies in a series of targeted strikes that began Sept. 15. About 32% of the union\u2019s 146,000 members at the automakers are now on strike. The automakers have been laying off workers at other plants as parts shortages have cascaded through their manufacturing systems.\n\nNeither the companies nor the union would comment on the talks Wednesday. The union\u2019s counter-offer of a 25% wage increase over four years was reported earlier by Bloomberg News and the trade publication Automotive News.\n\nMarick Masters, a business professor at Wayne State University in Detroit who studies labor issues, said it was not surprising that the union would be close to an agreement at this point in the talks.\n\n\u201cI think that Shawn Fain struck these plants at this particular time over the past week because he thought they would be near a deal and this would be the extra nudge to get something cemented,\u201d Masters said. \u201cWhen you look at the movement and the concessions, they\u2019re getting smaller but moving closer to what the union wanted.\u201d\n\nWhen contract talks began in July, the union sought 40% pay raises over four years as well as the restoration of cost-of-living raises. The union had given up the cost-of-living increases in 2009 to help the companies survive the aftermath of the Great Recession.\n\nThe UAW also wants traditional defined-benefit pension plans restored for workers who were hired after 2007, an end to varying tiers of wages for UAW workers, pension increases for retirees and other benefits.\n\nOne key issue is whether to extend the national UAW contract to 11 U.S. electric vehicle battery factories. This would essentially ensure that workers there would be represented by the union.\n\nAll but one of these plants are joint ventures with Korean battery makers. GM has agreed to this, but the other companies have balked, saying their joint venture partners must also agree.\n\nGM CEO Mary Barra said Tuesday that the offer to bring the battery plants into the master union agreement was still open but that they would have to meet what she called \u201cbenchmark economics and also operating flexibility.\u201d\n\nHaving union representation at the battery factories is a vital issue for the union because these plants will house many of the jobs of the future as the industry transitions away from gasoline vehicles. Workers who now make engines and transmissions at all three companies will need places to work as their plants are phased out.\n\nProgress in the contract talks follows statements from Ford executives in the past two weeks that their offers, which exceeded those of their competitors, are at the limit of how much the company is willing to pay to settle the strikes.\n\nAll three companies have said they don\u2019t want to absorb labor costs that are so high that they would force price increases and make their vehicles more expensive than those made by nonunion companies such as Tesla and Toyota.\n\nFain has argued that the companies are making billions in profits and can afford to pay the workers more.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/uaw-appears-moving-toward-potential-172308593.html", "symbols": ["F.MX", "F.US", "FDMO34.SA", "FMC1.F", "FMC1.XETRA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.99, "neg": 0.043, "neu": 0.878, "pos": 0.079}}, {"date": "2023-10-25T16:00:00+00:00", "title": "GM\u2019s Chevy Blazer EV Is a Winner, but No Victory Lap Until the Strike Is Over", "content": "MotorTrend named the all-electric Chevy Blazer the SUV of the year.

While Genuine Parts, PACCAR and General Motors managed to pull off an earnings beat, Tesla\u2019s 10 consecutive quarter-long beat streak snapped as it reported lower-than-expected earnings for the third quarter of 2023.\n\nPer the latest\u00a0Earnings Trend\u00a0report dated Oct 18, the auto sector\u2019s earnings for the third quarter of 2023 are expected to decline 12.2% on a year-over-year basis.

Before checking the key projections for these stocks, let's take a look at the general factors that are likely to shape the companies\u2019 upcoming results.\n\nThings to Note\n\nPer Automotive News, U.S. light vehicle sales in the third quarter of 2023 topped 3.8 million units, up 17% year over year, thanks to improving retail inventories and strong fleet shipments.\u00a0The seasonally adjusted annualized sales rate for September 2023 was 15.2-15.5 million vehicles, up from 13.7 million vehicles a year earlier, per GlobalData.\n\nAt the beginning of September, U.S. inventories had 2.2 million vehicles, representing an increase of approximately 813,000 cars and light trucks compared to September 2022, according to Cox Automotive. This marked a 60% increase from the year-ago levels and the highest new-vehicle inventory since early 2021.\n\nThe generous incentives offered by automakers are expected to have played a crucial role in boosting retail deliveries in the third quarter of 2023, offsetting the impact of high interest rates. However, discounts might have impacted margins. Also, commodity costs, forex woes, tough labor market and logistical challenges are likely to have played spoilsport. Moreover, high operating expenses, including R&D to develop technologically advanced products to adapt to the changing dynamics of the auto industry, are expected to have dented earnings.\n\nStory continues\n\nKey Releases on Oct 26\n\nFord: This legacy automaker surpassed earnings estimates in the last reported quarter on higher-than-expected automotive revenues. Over the trailing four quarters, Ford topped earnings estimates on two occasions for as many misses, with the average surprise being 20.1%. This is depicted in the graph below:\n\nFord Motor Company Price and EPS Surprise Ford Motor Company Price and EPS Surprise\n\nFord Motor Company price-eps-surprise | Ford Motor Company Quote\n\nOur proprietary model clearly indicates that a company needs to have the right combination of two key ingredients \u2014 a positive\u00a0Earnings ESP\u00a0and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) \u2014 to increase the odds of an earnings beat. You can see\u00a0the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Ford this earnings season.

You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our\u00a0Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company\u2019s\u00a0third-quarter earnings\u00a0is pegged at 40 cents per share. F is set to report quarterly results after the closing bell.\n\nFord saw its U.S. sales increase 7.7% year over year to 500,504 units. Sales of hybrid vehicles, ICE and EVs in the United States came in at 34,861, 444,681 and 20,962 units, up 41.4%, 5.4% and 14.8%, respectively, on a yearly basis.\u00a0Our estimate for global wholesale shipments of Ford Blue, Ford Model e and Ford Pro segments is pegged at 750,000, 43,000 and 382,000 units, implying a year-over-year uptick of 1.2%, 73.8% and 19%, respectively.\n\nOur forecast for third-quarter Ford Blue and Ford Pro adjusted EBIT implies an uptick of 6.2% and a whopping 370.1% on a year-over-year basis. However, we expect the Model e segment to incur an operating loss of $1.43 billion amid high costs.\n\nHarley-Davidson: This iconic motorcycle manufacturer missed earnings estimates in the last reported quarter on lower-than-anticipated revenues from the Motorcycles & Related Products. HOG surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the trailing four quarters and missed in the other, with the average surprise being 221.7%. This is depicted in the graph below:\n\nHarley-Davidson, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Harley-Davidson, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nHarley-Davidson, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Harley-Davidson, Inc. Quote\n\nOur model predicts an earnings beat for Harley-Davidson this time around as it carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has an Earnings ESP of +1.68%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for\u00a0third-quarter earnings\u00a0is pegged at $1.39 a share. HOG will unveil results before market open.\n\nHarley-Davidson is likely to have benefited from the Hardwire strategic plan, which aims at growth through refreshed product offerings. Our estimate for HOG\u2019s revenues from the Motorcycles and Related Products segment \u2014 which constitutes the bulk of the firm\u2019s overall revenues \u2014 is pegged at $1,362 million for the September-ended quarter, suggesting an increase from $1,205.2 million recorded in the second quarter of 2023. Our forecast for revenues from Financial Services is pegged at $202 million, suggesting a fall from $240 million generated in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nWe project operating profit from the HDMC segment to come in at around $220 million, suggesting an increase from $194.3 million generated in the last reported quarter. Our model estimate for operating profit from the HDFS segment is $60 million, compared with $59 million recorded in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nLKQ: This automotive replacement parts provider posted an earnings beat in the last reported quarter due to better-than-expected revenues from Wholesale North American and European segments. LKQ surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, with the average surprise being 1.53%. This is depicted in the graph below:\n\nLKQ Corporation Price and EPS Surprise LKQ Corporation Price and EPS Surprise\n\nLKQ Corporation price-eps-surprise | LKQ Corporation Quote\n\nOur model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for LKQ this time around, as it carries a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for\u00a0third-quarter earnings\u00a0is pegged at 95 cents a share. LKQ will unveil results before market open.\n\nIn 2023, the average age of a new vehicle in the United States rose to 12.5 years, up from 12.2 years in 2022. Ageing vehicles are likely to have boosted demand for LKQ\u2019s products. However, LKQ is witnessing supply chain disruptions, which might have resulted in product scarcity and freight delays. Problems related to freight costs and container capacity constraints are expected to have played spoilsport in the third quarter.\n\nOur estimate for quarterly revenues from parts and services in Europe is pegged at $1,533.8 million, suggesting a rise from $1,376 million recorded in the prior-year quarter. We expect third-quarter revenues from parts and services in the North America unit to be $1,255 million, indicating a rise from $1,026 million recorded in the prior-year period. However, we expect quarterly revenues from parts and services in the Specialty segment to be $402.7 million, implying a decline from $452 million reported in the prior-year quarter.\n\nOshkosh: The automotive equipment provider posted an earnings beat in the last reported quarter on high operating margins in the Access and Vocational segments. OSK surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in two of the trailing four quarters for as many misses, with the average surprise being 27.45%. This is depicted in the graph below:\n\nOshkosh Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Oshkosh Corporation Price and EPS Surprise\n\nOshkosh Corporation price-eps-surprise | Oshkosh Corporation Quote\n\nOur model predicts an earnings beat for OSK this earnings season, as it has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +8.24%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for\u00a0third-quarter earnings\u00a0is pegged at $2.18 a share. Oshkosh will unveil results before the opening bell.\n\nStrategic acquisitions like Pratt Miller, CartSeeker Technology, JBT's AeroTech business and Hinowa\u00a0coupled with investment in Robotics are likely to boost the to-be-reported quarter\u2019s results. Frequent business wins and a comprehensive offering of innovative new products are expected to aid Oshkosh\u2019s upcoming results.\n\nFor third-quarter 2023, we estimate Access Equipment revenues \u2014 which form more than 50% of the total revenues \u2014 to be around $1,273.4 million, implying an uptick of 22.7% from the year-ago period. Our forecast for the segment\u2019s operating profit is $182.3 million, suggesting growth of 48% on a yearly basis. Profits from Defense and Vocational segments are also estimated to rise year over year, thereby boosting OSK\u2019s overall third-quarter earnings.\n\nLear: This manufacturer of automotive seating and electronic systems posted an earnings beat in the last reported quarter on higher-than-expected revenues and profits across both segments. LEA surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of earnings in the trailing four quarters, with the average surprise being 8.07%. This is depicted in the graph below:\n\nLear Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Lear Corporation Price and EPS Surprise\n\nLear Corporation price-eps-surprise | Lear Corporation Quote\n\nAccording to our model, it seems Lear is poised to maintain its beat streak this earnings season as well. The company has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +2.63%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for\u00a0third-quarter earnings\u00a0is pegged at $2.56 a share. Lear will unveil results before the opening bell.\n\nLear is riding high on acquisitions, which are set to boost its upcoming results. The buyout of M&N Plastics has increased vertical integration in Lear\u2019s E-Systems unit. The Kongsberg acquisition has strengthened Lear\u2019s Seating business. The acquisition of Xevo has enhanced Lear\u2019s capabilities in software, services and data analytics.

With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. We'll use ROE to examine Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), by way of a worked example.\n\nReturn on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors\u2019 money. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Ford Motor\n\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nReturn on equity can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Ford Motor is:\n\n9.2% = US$4.0b \u00f7 US$44b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).\n\nThe 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.09.\n\nDoes Ford Motor Have A Good ROE?\n\nOne simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Ford Motor has a lower ROE than the average (15%) in the Auto industry. roe\n\nThat's not what we like to see. However, a low ROE is not always bad. If the company's debt levels are moderate to low, then there's still a chance that returns can be improved via the use of financial leverage. A company with high debt levels and low ROE is a combination we like to avoid given the risk involved.  Our risks dashboard should have the 3 risks we have identified for Ford Motor.\n\nHow Does Debt Impact ROE?\n\nVirtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.\n\nStory continues\n\nCombining Ford Motor's Debt And Its 9.2% Return On Equity\n\nIt appears that Ford Motor makes extensive use of debt to improve its returns, because it has an alarmingly high debt to equity ratio of 3.28. Most investors would need a low share price to be interested in a company with low ROE and high debt to equity.\n\nConclusion\n\nReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.\n\nBut ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward. So I think it may be worth checking this freereport on analyst forecasts for the company.\n\nOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.\r\n\r\nThat is because Ford is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings \u2014 with the most up-to-date information possible \u2014 is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for F in this report.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 46 cents per share for F, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 40 cents per share.

To skip the latest news and detailed analysis around the auto industry, go directly to the 5 Fastest Growing Auto Stocks to Buy.\n\nOver the last few years, the automotive industry has gone through significant changes, such as the increasing demand of electric vehicles (EVs) and the increased spending on autonomous vehicle research and deployment. However, these days, the latest strike by the United Auto Workers (UAW) is the hottest topic in the auto industry. The union is targeting Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), and Stellantis N.V. (NYSE:STLA) and its primary demand is a 40% wage hike with a 20% immediate increase. According to Wells Fargo analysts, the increase in demanded salaries and wages would \u201cadd an estimated $700 million to $1.2 billion in costs to each company over the four-year life of the contract.\u201d\n\nThe vice president of the union\u2019s GM department said on October 20 that both parties are moving toward a tentative agreement that could possibly end the 5-week strike. It has been reported that General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) is offering a 20% raise over the next four years while Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) offered 23%. The companies are eager to put things back to normal. General Motors Company (NYSE:GM)\u2019s management said:\n\n\"It is time for us to finish this process, get our team members back to work and get on with the business of making GM the company that will win and provide great jobs in the U.S. for our people for decades to come.\"\n\nEven though UAW President, Shawn Fain, believes that there is \u201cmore to be won,\u201d the union has not announced any further strikes yet. It is quite evident that these strikes are going to significantly affect the upcoming earnings reports of auto companies. However, Richard Hilgert, a Senior Equity Analyst for the automotive sector at Morningstar\u2019s research arm, says that the auto manufacturers can still evade massive losses if the strikes don\u2019t prolong.\n\nStory continues\n\nLatest in the Auto Industry\n\nAlthough the electrification of vehicles and autonomous vehicle technologies aren\u2019t that new, their demand and sales have certainly surged remarkably in the last few years. According to our previous report, the autonomous vehicle industry is expected to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 40% between 2021 and 2030. Some major companies that have introduced self-driving cars include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). Moreover, Honda Motor Co., Ltd. (NYSE:HMC) and General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), in a joint venture with GM\u2019s subsidiary, Cruise, are planning to start a self-driving taxi service in Japan in 2026.\n\nCompared to autonomous vehicles, EV adoption has been notably faster and EV stocks have been some of the fastest-growing vehicles stocks in 2023. In 2022, the number of alternative energy vehicles sold crossed 10 million, showing a 54% year-over-year (YoY) increase. In 2023, the International Energy Agency (IEA) believes that this number could reach 14 million.\n\nThe companies that are currently dominating the EV market include Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) and BYD Company Limited (OTC:BYDDY). Nevertheless, automotive giants such as General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM), and Stellantis N.V. (NYSE:STLA) have also started to invest heavily in the sector. In fact, Stellantis N.V. (NYSE:STLA) has already captured a noteworthy market share of the industry and is one of the top ten EV manufacturers in the world.\n\nDespite the recent events that put a bearish light on the automotive industry, it still is poised for growth in the future. Analysts believe that the total vehicle sales will surpass 69 million units in 2023, and reach around 74 million in 2024. For the current year, some of the fastest-growing automotive stocks include Modine Manufacturing Company (NYSE:MOD), Carvana Co. (NYSE:CVNA), and Li Auto Inc. (NASDAQ:LI).

(NYSE:STLA)\n\n1-year stock price growth as of October 20: 40.79%\n\nStellantis N.V. (NYSE:STLA) is a well-known car manufacturer that came into being as a result of a merger between the Italian-American giant, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) and the French PSA Group. One of the fastest-growing automotive stocks, Stellantis N.V.

It distributes accessories, parts, and related services through its brand, Mopar while its Spoticar brand is responsible for selling used cars.\n\nIn Q2, Stellantis N.V.

(NYSE:STLA), which makes Jeep, Dodge and Fiat cars. The company has a nearly 8% dividend yield with enough net cash (cash minus debt) on the balance sheet to cover the dividend for almost five years. The company trades at 1.7x operating profits, which means the market is already expecting a likely drop in cash flow. Still, the shares appear to be worth meaningfully more than where they trade, and management is heavily aligned with stockholders with a 14% stake. They share our view that the valuation is compelling, as the company plans on repurchasing ~3% of shares outstanding this year.\u201d\n\n7. Honda Motor Co., Ltd. (NYSE:HMC)\n\n1-year stock price growth as of October 20: 47.28%\n\nHonda Motor Co., Ltd.

(NYSE:HMC), a manufacturer of cars, motorcycles, general-purpose engines, and a range of other power products in the consumer discretionary sector. The company has struggled to make progress in improving its recent mediocre sales trends while its current plan for transitioning to electric vehicles and motors is less compelling than its more transparent peers. Given the risk of the Japanese yen strengthening as yet another headwind to the company\u2019s intermediate performance, we elected to close the position in favor of other opportunities.\u201d\n\n6.
