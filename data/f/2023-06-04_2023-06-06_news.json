[{"date": "2023-06-06T19:47:26+00:00", "title": "Bozeman has a proving curve at C.H. Robinson", "content": "Dave Bozeman faces a big challenge (Photo: Ford)\n\nThe selection of David Bozeman as the new CEO of C.H. Robinson Worldwide Inc. came as a surprise to most people. It may have come as a surprise to some on the company\u2019s 11-person board as well. Typically, a news release announcing such a move will specify if the board\u2019s decision was unanimous. That didn\u2019t happen here.\n\nGoing into last week, the consensus was that former UPS Inc. (NYSE: UPS) COO Jim Barber, who sits on Robinson\u2019s (NASDAQ: CHRW) board, was the odds-on favorite for the job. That a decision had not been made led some to believe that Barber\u2019s IT chops weren\u2019t what the Robinson board was looking for.\n\nBozeman, who starts June 26, lacks C-level experience, a factor that concerned Ken Hoexter, an analyst at Bank of America Securities. For a \u201ccompany in transition\u201d like Robinson, which has struggled in recent quarters, especially at its freight forwarding unit, a \u201clonger learning curve of a C-level position could be an overhang on turnaround timing,\u201d Hoexter wrote prior to the announcement.\n\nAnother question will be whether Bozeman has the skill sets such as in freight forwarding, ocean freight and third-party logistics required for such a demanding job. Without any C-level experience, Bozeman has never had to identify and execute strategies to turn around a company. He does have significant supply chain experience, however.\n\nBozeman joins Robinson from Ford Motor Co., (NYSE: F) where he spent less than a year as vice president of its customer service division. He also spent five years as vice president of transportation services at Amazon.com Inc., (NASDAQ: AMZN) where he built the e-commerce giant\u2019s middle-mile delivery network, as well as lengthy stints at Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT) and Harley-Davidson Co. (NYSE: HOG).\n\nHe is also an outsider, a fact that may have weighed in his favor.\n\nBascome Majors, an analyst at Susquehanna International Group, was a more sanguine observer. \u201cToday, Dave lacks name recognition with most transport investors,\u201d which might have explained the steep (6.4%) dive that shares took on Monday, he wrote. \u201cThat said, we think only a clear \u2018slash and burn\u2019 hire would have driven a short-term pop, and Mr. Bozeman\u2019s resume doesn\u2019t fit that narrative (on paper at least).\n\n\u201cLonger-term, his skill set of managing global teams at customer-focused organizations, including at Amazon\u2019s complex transportation & supply chain operation, could help Dave earn the trust of CHRW\u2019s employees and investors, like another former Ford executive (Joe Hinrichs) is doing today at CSX (NYSE: CSX).\u201d\n\nJason H Seidl, analyst at Cowen & Co., said in a Tuesday note that Bozeman\u2019s tenure at Amazon was the key reason he got the job. \u201cWe believe his time spent at the home delivery giant could potentially serve CHRW\u2019s digital brokerage platform well,\u201d he wrote.\n\nBrittain Ladd, a longtime logistics executive, was cautiously optimistic about the move. \u201cI\u2019m amazed at how many people have reached out to me to question the selection of David. A lot of people don\u2019t understand that a VP of transportation at Amazon has a tremendous amount of responsibility, certainly more responsibility than the average VP of transportation. David is credited with driving a lot of changes at Amazon and he was highly respected.\n\n\u201cDavid can be successful in the role as long as he surrounds himself with the best executives he can hire from Amazon, DB Schenker, DSV and certainly Amazon. David has to own the role of CEO. I believe he will have no choice but to terminate board members [and] to bring in board members who want the company to grow and take risks,\u201d Ladd said.\n\nThe outspoken Ladd said Robinson under Bozeman \u201cshould absolutely go after an acquisition of DSV or at a minimum, acquire Uber Freight.\u201d\n\nIn addition, Bozeman should contact Capgemini Invent, Deloitte or the Boston Consulting Group and have them conduct an independent review of Robinson\u2019s operations and technology; determine future technology needs and optimal organizational structure; identify acquisition opportunities and which parts of the business to divest if any; and design the optimal go-forward strategy for the company, Ladd said.\n\n\u201cIf Bozeman doesn\u2019t do this, he will be in a situation where C.H. Robinson executives will do their best to protect their pet projects and fiefdoms. Bozeman needs an independent assessment of the company and a strategy that he can drive using a team he can trust,\u201d he said.\n\nThe post Bozeman has a proving curve at C.H.

Unfortunately, there may not be enough of it to go around, creating opportunities for cheap lithium stocks. In fact, that\u2019s what Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares just said:\u00a0\u201cWe know that we need lithium. We know that we are not producing as much as we need. We have right now 1.3 billion cars (that are) internal combustion engines powered on the planet. We need to replace that with clean mobility. That will need a lot of lithium. Not only the lithium may not be enough, but the concentration of the mining of lithium may create other geopolitical issues,\u201d he said, as quoted by The Detroit News.\n\nIt\u2019s why automakers like Ford (NYSE:F), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), and General Motors (NYSE:GM) are racing to put together lithium deals to secure supply. That\u2019s because even they know supply may not meet surging demand, especially when the world wants to put millions of electric vehicles on the roads.\n\nThat being said, here are seven cheap lithium stocks to consider now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCheap Lithium Stocks: Albemarle (ALB) Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com\n\nThe last time I spoke about the industry\u2019s 800 lb. gorilla\u00a0Albemarle (NYSE:ALB), it traded at $180 on May 5. It would test $220 shortly after. Now, at $195.54, I strongly believe the stock could see another strong rebound on a tight lithium supply story. Better, as we wait for ALB to recover, we can collect its current 0.82% yield.\n\nHelping, the ALB stock was just upgraded to a buy rating at UBS, with a price target of $225. According to UBS, the pullback creates a good entry point. Analysts at Baird also upgraded the ALB stock to a buy rating from hold, with a price target of $288 from $222. That\u2019s because lithium demand isn\u2019t showing any clear signs of slowing down.\n\nEven better, Albemarle just announced a definitive agreement with\u00a0Ford to deliver battery-grade lithium, which could lead to the development of about three million Ford EV batteries. Granted, Albemarle did lower its outlook for revenue and profitability this year on the heels of softer lithium prices, but even that\u2019s showing signs of improvement. In fact, the company still expects to post respectable growth for the year, as demand for lithium \u2013 especially for electric vehicles\u2013 remains strong.\n\nLivent Corp. (LTHM) Livent Corporation logo on a phone screen. LTHM stock.\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nI last weighed in on Livent Corp. (NYSE:LTHM) on May 5. At the time, the lithium stock traded at just $22.75. It would run to $25.86 shortly after and head south with the market. However, don\u2019t write it off just yet. It could bounce back here after finding strong support for around $23.46.\n\nBetter, the company is producing solid numbers. In fact, it just posted an EPS of 60 cents on $235.5 million in sales. The Street was only looking for 39 cents in earnings on sales of $230.2 million. Even better, LTHM raised its full-year guidance. It now expects its EBITDA to fall between $530 million and $600 million. That\u2019s well above prior EBITDA guidance for $510 million to $530 million.\n\nAnalysts love the LTHM stock, too. KeyBanc, for example, just upgraded the stock to a buy rating from hold, with a $30 price target. Part of the reason for that is news lithium inventories in China\u2013 at the battery cell / EV OEM level \u2014 are starting to decline, as noted by Barron\u2019s.\n\nEven better, Livent and Allkem Ltd. will combine in an all-stock $10.6 billion deal by year-end. Under the deal, Livent shareholders will receive 2.406 shares in the combined firm for each share.\n\nLithium Americas (LAC) smartphone with logo of Canadian company Lithium Americas Corp on screen\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother top lithium stock to own is Lithium Americas (NYSE:LAC). I also highlighted LAC on May 5, as it traded at $19.50 before it ran to about $23 a share. Now back to $20.05, it\u2019s also starting to pivot higher. Eventually, LAC could see higher highs. All thanks to its Thacker Pass lithium project, where construction just started.\n\nBetter, the company just received a\u00a0$650 million investment from\u00a0General Motors to accelerate the project\u2019s development. Lithium Americas is expected to make its first delivery in the second half of 2026, at which point the profits should roll in.\n\nEven better, Lithium Americas will soon split in two, which includes its North American and Argentinian business units. Lithium Argentina, for example, will focus on the company\u2019s 44.8% interest in\u00a0Cauchar\u00ed-Olaroz, its 100%-owned Pastos Grandes project, and its interest in the Sal de la Puna.\u00a0Meanwhile, Lithium Americas will focus on its Thacker Pass lithium project in Humboldt County, Nevada.\n\nAmplify Lithium & Battery Technology ETF (BATT) rows of lithium ion batteries\n\nSource: Lightboxx/ShutterStock.com\n\nThe Amplify Lithium & Battery Technology ETF (NYSEARCA:BATT) was another hot lithium opportunity mentioned on May 5. At the time, BATT traded at $12.25 and ran to $12.63. Now at $12.20, it\u2019s at support dating back to March. I\u2019d like to see BATT eventually test $13 a share.\n\nWith an expense ratio of 0.59%, the BATT ETF provides exposure to global companies deriving material revenue from developing, producing, and using lithium battery technology.\n\nGlobal X Lithium & Battery Tech ETF (LIT) numerous blue-colored batteries lithium stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nOr, look at the\u00a0Global X Lithium & Battery Tech ETF (NYSEARCA:LIT), which traded at $60 on May 5. While it would test $64, it has since pulled back to support at $61.30. From here, I\u2019d like to see it retest $64 again.\n\nWith an expense ratio of 0.75%, the LIT ETF\u00a0invests in the complete lithium cycle. Everything from mining and refining the metal through battery production. Some of its top holdings include\u00a0Albemarle,\u00a0TDK Corp. (OTCMKTS:TTDKY), BYD Co. (OTCMKTS:BYDDF), Tesla,\u00a0Livent Corp., Piedmont Lithium (NASDAQ:PLL), and Standard Lithium (NYSEMKT:SLI).\n\nAmerican Lithium (AMLI)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAmerican Lithium Corp.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMLI) is another hot opportunity in the lithium space. Remember, with global leaders phasing out combustion engine cars for electric vehicles, we\u2019re running short on key metals like lithium. Accordingly, prices are only set to soar with supply-demand issues likely to continue. Even better, the company just received the first of three permits from Peruvian authorities for drilling near Quelcaya, with drilling expected to start immediately.\n\nEven better, according to\u00a0Simon Clarke, CEO of American Lithium, \u201cThis is a very significant development for the Company which validates recent supportive comments from the new government in Peru and enables us to target the discovery of new lithium mineralization on some of the best previously identified targets on the Macusani Plateau.\u201d\n\nSociedad Quimica y Minera (SQM) Sociedad Quimica y Minera logo displayed on a mobile phone with the company's web page on it. SQM stock\n\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\n\nOr, take a look at Sociedad Quimica y Minera (NYSE:SQM). After running from about $61 to $75, it dropped to $66.17, where it started to pivot higher. From here, I\u2019d like to see SQM again test $75. Even better, as we wait for SQM to recover, we can collect its yield of 16.89% at the moment.\n\nSQM also just announced a long-term strategic agreement with Ford to secure the supply of high-quality lithium products for the production of electric vehicles. Plus, as noted by InvestorPlace contributor Muslim Farooque, \u201cSQM\u2019s financial performance has been nothing short of spectacular, with revenues rocketing from 386% over the past decade to an astounding $10.7 billion last year. This meteoric rise is because of robust growth in lithium sales.\u201d\n\nPlus, with lithium demand very likely to increase, Chilean companies like SQM are in the hotspot. After all, the region has the world\u2019s biggest proven lithium reserves, second to Australia.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Cooper\u00a0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the\u00a0InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nIan Cooper, a contributor to InvestorPlace.com, has been analyzing stocks and options for web-based advisories since 1999.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nBuy This $5 Stock BEFORE This Apple Project Goes Live Did Elon Musk Just Trigger a New Netscape Moment?

AM radio is particularly susceptible to disruption because it uses frequencies like those emitted by EV systems, which can overwhelm the radio signal and make it unintelligible. FM stations operate over different wavelengths. Shielding radio reception gear can be costly and complex, especially when vehicle users can access AM signals via digital platforms.\n\nBroadcasters say AM radio deserves protection because it\u2019s a linchpin of the US emergency information system, and remains important on a day-to-day basis for millions of listeners including rural, religious and foreign-language audiences.\n\n\u201cWhen the power goes out and cell networks are down, the car radio is often the only way for people to get information, sometimes for days at a time,\u201d Jerry Chapman, president of Woof Boom Radio, which operates three AM stations in Indiana and Ohio, said in testimony for a US House hearing on Tuesday.\n\nMore than four dozen House members have signed onto the AM Radio for Every Vehicle Act, a bill that would require all new cars and trucks to receive AM broadcast signals.\n\n\u201cRemoving AM radio receivers from vehicles means individuals may miss out on critical lifesaving updates,\u201d said Representative Bob Latta, the Ohio Republican who chairs the communications panel that held the hearing. \u201cWe must ensure that no community\u2019s left behind, no voice is silenced and no emergency response is compromised.\u201d\n\nOvertones of the US partisan divide have crept into the discussion, with some zeroing in on talk radio, where conservative hosts such as Sean Hannity thrive on AM channels.\n\n\u201cAM radio is worth keeping in our cars,\u201d Senator Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, tweeted last week. \u201cMillions of Americans listen to talk radio. It\u2019s central to our democracy and freedom of expression.\u201d\n\nMichael Harrison, publisher of Talkers magazine, which covers the talk radio industry, said he doubted carmakers had any intention to quiet conservative voices on talk radio. But he lamented the rift in what he called a \u201clong, symbiotic relationship.\u201d\n\n\u201cRadio has exalted the automobile as being mythical, and gorgeous,\u201d Harrison said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s almost a betrayal on the part of these car manufacturers to say, we\u2019re getting rid of AM radio.\u2019\u201d\n\nCarmakers, their dashboards replete with FM radio, internet and satellite-radio links, can cite evidence that users prefer those media, which were unforeseen when AM commenced commercial broadcasting in 1920.\n\nAM radio was once the dominant form of audio entertainment. Until 1978, more than half of all radio listening hours were spent on the AM dial, the Federal Communications Commission said in 2015.\n\nBut by late 2022, only about 15% of people 12 and older listened to AM radio during an average week \u2014 less than half the 34% who did in 2000, according to Nielsen data provided to Bloomberg. The AM radio audience is older and whiter than FM radio\u2019s, according to Nielsen.\n\nBroadcasters say a Nielsen survey for fall 2022 showed 82 million Americans listen to AM radio monthly.\n\nCarmakers omitting broadcast AM tuners from electric vehicles include Volvo Group, Volkswagen AG and Mazda Motor Corp., according to Senator Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat who objects to excluding AM radio from cars.\n\nFord Motor Co. was originally on that list too, dropping AM radio from the F-150 Lightning pickup truck and the Mustang, saying AM listeners accounted for less than 5% of radio usage in its vehicles. But the company changed course last month and Chief Executive Officer Jim Farley said all 2024 Ford and Lincoln vehicles will include AM broadcast radio.\n\nFarley said the reversal came \u201cafter speaking with policy leaders about the importance of AM broadcast radio as a part of the emergency alert system.\u201d He didn\u2019t say what might happen after 2024.\n\nThe AM Radio for Every Vehicle Act would direct regulators at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to require automakers to maintain AM broadcast radio in new vehicles at no additional charge, bill sponsors said in a news release.\n\nBackers of the bill include the National Association of Broadcasters, which said that a 77-station emergency alert system with direct connections to US officials includes more than 60 AM stations.\n\n\u201cTake away these stations and you\u2019re really undoing the ability of every American to get emergency alerts,\u201d broadcasters\u2019 association President Curtis LeGeyt said in an interview. He said such a problem is \u201csmall right now\u201d but added, \u201cwhat does public safety look like as new vehicles proliferate?\u201d\n\nGary Shapiro, chief executive officer of the Consumer Technology Association that includes carmakers as members, scoffed at the public-safety rationale. The collapse of alternative warning systems including mobile phones, FM radio and satellite radio is \u201cpossible but extraordinarily unlikely,\u201d Shapiro said.\n\nElectric vehicles are a growing portion of the US market, and accounted for about 7% of new vehicle sales in the first quarter, according to Cox Automotive.\n\nA mandate requiring AM broadcast reception is \u201cjust one more thing hindering the introduction of electric cars,\u201d Shapiro said in an interview.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nA $1.5 Trillion Backstop for Homebuyers Props Up Banks Instead Giorgia Meloni Seeks to Cement Power by Remaking Corporate Italy China\u2019s BYD Is Racing Toward the Top of the Global EV Market Google\u2019s Top Lawyer Preps for Fights Over AI and Tech \u2018Censorship\u2019 Moving Saharan Sunshine to Europe via Undersea Cables\n\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/am-radio-fights-back-getting-175620858.html", "symbols": ["F.MX", "F.US", "FDMO34.SA", "FMC1.F", "FMC1.XETRA", "TL0.F", "TL0.XETRA", "TSLA.MX", "TSLA.US", "TSLA34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": -0.895, "neg": 0.056, "neu": 0.907, "pos": 0.037}}, {"date": "2023-06-06T15:08:40+00:00", "title": "Ford recalls 125,000 popular Maverick pickups and SUVs over fire risk", "content": "Ford\u2019s (F) quality and reliability issues have popped up again, this time with a big recall of some of its most popular products.\n\nFord is recalling over 125,000 Ford Maverick pickups (2022-2023) and Ford Escape (2020-2023) and Lincoln Corsair (2021-2023) SUVs that are equipped with automaker\u2019s 2.5L hybrid or plug-in hybrid engines over a risk of fire, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) reported on its website.\n\n\u201cIn the event of an engine failure, engine oil and fuel vapor may be released into the engine compartment and accumulate near ignition sources such as hot engine or exhaust components, possibly resulting in an engine compartment fire,\u201d NHTSA said Monday.\n\nWith these two latest recalls, Ford now leads the industry with 27 separate product recalls this year, affecting more than 3.1 million vehicles, according to NHTSA\u2019s website.

The recovery in inventories and the introduction of attractive incentives played a pivotal role in driving the surge.\n\nIn this article, we will examine these factors in more detail, highlight the sales figures of different automakers and discuss the outlook for the industry.\n\nImproving Inventory Levels Supporting Pent-Up Demand\n\nOne of the key drivers of U.S. auto sales growth in May was the significant improvement in inventory levels compared to a year ago, when the industry faced severe supply chain disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. According to estimates from J.D. Power and LMC Automotive, retail inventory was approximately 1.3 million vehicles at the start of June, reflecting a 48% increase from a year earlier. Shoppers now have a plethora of vehicle options to choose from after limited product availability last year.\n\nCharlie Chesbrough, Cox Automotive's senior economist, said in a statement, \"Vehicle shoppers now have a much better chance of finding something that fits their needs. Pent-up demand, held back by limited product availability last year, is now being fulfilled as inventory levels improve around the country.\"\n\nThe Honda brand had a substantial inventory of 34,000 vehicles, showcasing a significant increase from the 12,000 units recorded in the prior year. Similarly, Acura witnessed a notable surge in its stock, with approximately 21,000 vehicles on hand, compared with 4,000 units reported at the beginning of June 2022.\n\nToyota ended May with a total inventory of 153,742 Toyota and Lexus models. Among these, 27,255 units were available at dealerships, while the remaining vehicles were either in ports or in transit.Ford reported a total inventory of 383,000 vehicles, which encompassed a range of models, including medium and heavy-duty trucks.\n\nIrresistible Discount Offers Fueling Sales\n\nAnother factor that boosted U.S. auto sales in May was the increase in incentives offered by some automakers and dealers to stimulate demand and entice potential buyers. According to TrueCar, the average incentive amount reached $1,931 last month, representing a 13% increase from April and a substantial 64% increase from May 2022. Automakers like General Motors GM, Ford F, Volkswagen VWAGY, Stellantis STLA and others offered sweeter incentives to buoy sales.\n\nVolkswagen witnessed a remarkable surge in incentives, which skyrocketed fourfold to a staggering $2,048 per vehicle, as reported by Motor Intelligence. Meanwhile, Jeep claimed the throne for the highest incentives, now standing at an impressive $3,428 per vehicle, nearly triple its offering from the same period last year. Other automakers like Ford, Hyundai, Buick, and Honda also experienced a significant leap in their incentive outlays.\n\nChevrolet strategically captured the attention of qualified buyers working through GM Financial by offering an alluring 1.9% financing deal on carefully selected crossovers and SUVs. Adding to the appeal, buyers were also granted a generous respite from payments for an extended period of 90 days. In a similar vein, select Stellantis dealers went the extra mile, providing customers with an unprecedented opportunity to save a remarkable sum of up to $12,000 on the iconic Jeep Grand Wagoneer.\n\nThese incentives not only provided financial benefits but also created a sense of urgency and encouraged buyers to take advantage of the deals while they last.\n\nRundown of Sales Figures of Auto Biggies\n\nFord\u2019s U.S. sales volumes rose 10.7% in May. The Ford brand saw an increase of 12%, whereas Lincoln witnessed a decline of 14.4%. Ford brand sales have been on a consistent upward trajectory for the past six months, while Lincoln's volume has faced a decline for three consecutive months. Ford currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see\u00a0the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nHonda witnessed a significant surge in sales, with a total of 119,445 units sold, reflecting a remarkable 58.2% increase compared to the previous year. Both the Honda and Acura brands experienced impressive year-over-year growth, with sales rising 53.2% and 112.2%, respectively. Moreover, Honda's electric vehicles achieved a milestone by setting a new monthly record with more than 32,000 deliveries in May. This marked American Honda's third consecutive monthly increase after a challenging period of decline caused by severe inventory shortages as a result of tight microchip supplies and shipping difficulties.\n\nPer Automotive News, Toyota experienced a 6.4% year-over-year increase in US sales in May, reaching a total of 187,205 vehicles. The namesake brand witnessed a 3.7% rise, while Lexus saw a substantial surge of 25% in sales. Notably, light trucks played a significant role in boosting the Toyota brand, with an impressive 11% gain, which offset the 8.9% decline observed in car sales.\n\nPer Automotive News, sales of Hyundai were up 18.4% year over year. Sales of Kia grew 23.4% year over year for the month. Sales of Subaru increased 28.2%, while that of Mazda jumped 117.2%.\n\nWill the Industry Face Turbulence in 2H23?\n\nThe automotive industry has made impressive strides in its recovery but the road ahead is not without obstacles. As we approach the second half of 2023, rising interest rates and looming economic headwinds cast a shadow of uncertainty over the industry's sales momentum.\n\nIndustry experts at Cox Automotive anticipate a slowdown in the sales trajectory, cautioning that challenges lie ahead. However, it's not all doom and gloom. The silver lining comes in the form of continued higher incentives and a surge in fleet volume, which are expected to provide much-needed support to overall sales figures.\n\nS&P Global Mobility paints a cautious picture, suggesting that the current trend in volumes is likely to persist in the coming months. While there might not be any dramatic deviations, concerns about affordability loom on the horizon. These affordability issues could potentially put the brakes on further growth, presenting a critical challenge for the industry.\n\nEconomic headwinds are gathering strength, and their impact could introduce some volatility in sales in the second half of the year. Quoting Jeff Schuster, executive vice president and automotive group head at GlobalData, \"While we are still concerned that the recovery could lose momentum as pent-up demand is satisfied, there is growing optimism that the U.S. market will continue to outperform expectations through the summer months.\"\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

With improving inventory, incentives, and the surging popularity of EVs, the Zacks Domestic Auto Industry is well-positioned for a prosperous future. In this article, we delve into the key drivers that are propelling the U.S. auto industry to new heights and why you should not miss out on two top-ranked domestic auto stocks namely \u2014Ford F and General Motors GM \u2014 that are riding the wave of industry strength.\n\nAbout the Industry\n\nThe Zacks\u00a0Domestic Auto\u00a0industry includes companies that are engaged in designing, manufacturing and retailing vehicles across the globe. These include passenger cars, crossover vehicles, sport utility vehicles, trucks, vans, motorcycles and electric vehicles. The industry \u2014 which is highly consumer cyclic and provides employment to a large number of people \u2014 is at the forefront of innovation, courtesy of its nature and the transformation that it is going through. The widespread usage of technology and rapid digitization are resulting in a fundamental restructuring of the automotive market. Several companies in the industry have engine and transmission plants and conduct research and development, and testing of electric and autonomous vehicles.\n\nKey Investing Themes\n\nImproving Inventory Levels Supporting Pent-Up Demand: With the gradual alleviation of challenges associated with new vehicle production, inventory levels are experiencing significant improvements.According to estimates from J.D. Power and LMC Automotive, retail inventory was approximately 1.3 million vehicles at the start of June, reflecting a 48% increase from the previous year. Strong production levels are expected to translate into extended days' supply, thereby providing shoppers with a greater abundance of vehicle options as we move forward.\n\nSweeter Discount Deals Fueling Sales: The increased inventories resulted in more generous incentives being offered to potential buyers. Several manufacturers, including Ford, Hyundai and General Motors among others, have witnessed a significant surge in their incentive outlays. According to TrueCar, the average incentive amount reached $1,931 last month, representing a 13% increase from April and a substantial 64% increase from May 2022. By offering generous incentives, automakers and dealers aim to stimulate demand and entice potential buyers into making a purchase. These incentives not only provide financial benefits but also create a sense of urgency and encourage buyers to take advantage of the deals while they last.\n\nRapidly Increasing EV Popularity Acts as a Vital Catalyst: The rising adoption of green vehicles driven by climate change concerns, technological advancements, and stringent fuel-emission standards is boosting the prospects of the U.S. auto industry. Electric car demand is skyrocketing and EV sales are consistently breaking records. Last year was the biggest for zero-emission vehicles in the United States. Legacy automakers are making significant efforts to establish a strong presence in the thriving e-mobility sector. The Inflation Reduction Act is set to further fuel EV sales. With the continued momentum and expected future growth, the prospects of the U.S. auto industry in the EV market are highly promising.\n\nZacks Industry Rank Indicates Solid Prospects\n\nThe Zacks Automotive \u2013 Domestic industry is an 18-stock group within the broader Zacks\u00a0Auto-Tires-Trucks\u00a0sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #76, which places it in the top 30% of 250 Zacks industries.\n\nThe group\u2019s\u00a0Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates encouraging near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nThe industry\u2019s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gaining confidence in this group\u2019s earnings growth potential.\n\nBefore we present you two top-ranked stocks from the industry, let's take a look at the industry\u2019s stock market performance and current valuation.\n\nIndustry Lags S&P 500 But Tops Sector\n\nThe Domestic Auto industry has underperformed the Zacks S&P 500 composite but its outperformed sector over the past year. The industry has lost 15.8% against the S&P 500\u2019s growth of 4.1%. The sector has declined 18.9% over the said time frame.\n\nOne-Year Price Performance\n\nIndustry's Current Valuation\n\nSince automotive companies are debt-laden, it makes sense to value them based on the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio. On the basis of the trailing 12-month enterprise value to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA), the industry is currently trading at 14.80X compared with the S&P 500\u2019s 12.99X and the sector\u2019s 12.22X. Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 57.29X, as low as 8.78X and at a median of 15.31X, as the chart below shows.\n\nEV/EBITDA Ratio (Past Five Years)\n\n2 Best Stocks to Buy Now\n\nFord: It is one of the leading automakers in the nation. A strong vehicle mix supported by F-series trucks and SUV models, combined with a robust EV lineup, should drive Ford\u2019s growth. The company has tremendous growth opportunity, particularly with highly coveted franchises such as the F-150, the new Maverick, the new Bronco, and, undoubtedly, the Mustang. Further, Ford\u2019s ambitious rejig plan to split its EV business into a separate unit within the company is set to unlock significant growth opportunities. Ford\u2019s target of producing over 2 million EVs by 2026-end (representing 49% CAGR over the span of 2023-2026) augurs well. The company\u2019s high liquidity provides a solid foundation for investment in Ford+ priorities.\n\nFord currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and has a Value Score of A.\u00a0The Zacks Consensus Estimate for F\u2019s 2023 sales implies year-over-year growth of 7.5%.

Over the trailing four quarters, the stock surpassed estimates on two occasions for as many misses, the average surprise being 24.3%.\n\nPrice & Consensus: F\n\nGeneral Motors: One of the world\u2019s largest automakers, General Motors held the largest share of the U.S. auto market at 16% in 2022.General Motors\u2019 compelling portfolio with strong demand for its quality full-size pickups and SUVs bode well. The company\u2019s hot-selling brands in America like Chevrolet Silverado, Equinox and GMC Sierra are driving the top line.\u00a0 Encouragingly, this legacy U.S. automaker will have nine EV models in the North America market this year, which will buoy top-line growth.The company's Ultium platform and battery plants in Ohio, Tennessee and Lansing are set to scale up its e-mobility prowess.

To make the most of a stock\u2019s upside, you need to be able to identify companies that have the potential to go far. Of course, not all companies become great giants in the industry but it can be rewarding to watch them grow starting from cheap small cap stocks.\n\nThe reason: there\u2019s a chance it could become a multi-bagger over the years. However, there is a certain amount of risk associated with cheap small-cap stocks and if you can take the risk, you enjoy a higher chance of a near-term upside. Inflation is cooling and the market is picking up the pace. If we can manage to avoid a recession, there is a chance that the market will lift several stocks.\n\nWith that in mind, let\u2019s take a look at three cheap small-cap stocks to buy before the next breakout.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCanadian Solar (CSIQ) A Canadian Solar (CSIQ) display booth at a convention in Bangkok, Thailand.\n\nSource: Shutter B Photo / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith the world moving towards a cleaner and greener future, solar stocks are a safe bet. The rising gas prices and the growing awareness of renewable energy have put Canadian Solar (NASDAQ:CSIQ) at the center stage. It has shown strong momentum lately and shares are up 30% year to date.\n\nCSIQ stock is trading at $39 today and is up 6% in the past month. It has shown consistent momentum over the past year and I believe the stock will continue moving upwards in the near term. The solar panel maker boosted its annual solar module capacity which makes it one of the largest solar panel producers. It has supply agreements with multiple companies, which contribute maximum to the revenue.\n\nRoth MKM has raised the stock\u2019s price target to an average of $47.18 and has a buy rating after the company announced the pricing of its China IPO. One reason behind this is the future growth potential and the demand for solar. It can make the most of the clean energy boom and is positioned for solid long-term growth.\n\nSolid Power (SLDP) Smartphone with logo of American battery company Solid Power Inc. on screen in front of business website. Focus on center-left of phone display.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother green energy stock, Solid Power (NASDAQ:SLDP) is slightly risky but has the potential if it handles the operations well. The company aims to deliver a safer battery option that has high energy density and will cost less than traditional lithium-ion batteries.\n\nWhile it is a penny stock, it is only suitable for high-risk investors who want to take a chance at the future of solid-state batteries. There is a 50/50 chance of the company making it big. Solid Power also has the backing of BMW (OTCMKTS:BMWYY) and Ford (NYSE:F) which shows that there is some potential in its product. It has licensed the cell design as well as the manufacturing process to BMW for research and development.\n\nSLDP stock is trading at $2.24 today and is down 25% in the past six months. The company has a negative margin and reported a quarterly loss of $0.11 per share. It is one of the cheap small-cap stocks with a 100% upside potential if all goes well.\n\ne.l.f. Beauty (ELF) a collection of various cosmetic products on a black table\n\nSource: Africa Studio/Shutterstock.com\n\ne.l.f. Beauty (NYSE: ELF) is one of the most promising small-cap stocks to own. The company makes affordable beauty products and is making news in the highly competitive beauty industry.\n\nIt has built a solid customer base through social media-driven marketing activities and investments in research and development. Yes, the stock is trading at a high and is not cheap but it has a long run. A lot depends on how the economy moves from here. Even if there is a recession, people may switch from high-priced beauty products to more affordable products that are offered by e.l.f Beauty. It is one of the cheap small-cap stocks with solid growth potential.\n\nIn the recent\u00a0company earnings, it beat estimates in revenue and earnings. The company reported quarterly earnings of 0.42 per share and hit a revenue of $187.36 million. It has beaten revenue estimates in the last four quarters. The stock was up 9% after earnings beat and half a dozen analysts raised their price target on the stock. This is one of the undervalued small-cap stocks with the potential to double in the coming months.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Here we will discuss the success of five such stocks. These include Ford Motor Company F, Toll Brothers Inc. TOL, Urban Outfitters Inc. URBN and Telefonica, S.A. TEF .\n\nA Few More Words on GARP\n\nThe GARP theory enables the strategic mingling of growth and value-investing principles, which gives us a hybrid strategy by utilizing the best features of both. What GARPers look for is whether or not the stocks are somewhat undervalued and have solid sustainable growth potential (Investopedia).\n\nGARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics \u2014 the price/earnings growth (PEG) ratio. Although it is categorized under value investing, this strategy follows the principles of both growth and value investing.\n\nThe PEG ratio is defined as (Price/ Earnings)/Earnings Growth Rate.\n\nIt relates a stock\u2019s P/E ratio with the future earnings growth rate.\n\nWhile P/E alone only gives an idea of stocks that are trading at a discount, PEG, while adding the growth element to it, helps to identify stocks that have solid future potential.\n\nA lower PEG ratio, preferably less than 1, is always better for GARP investors.\n\nSay for example, if a stock's P/E ratio is 10 and the expected long-term growth rate is 15%, the company's PEG will come down to 0.66, a ratio that indicates both undervaluation and future growth potential.\n\nHowever, the question that often arises is whether the market has an adequate number of companies that are growing earnings while trading at reasonable valuations. Going by a CFA Institute Blog by Nicolas Rabener, \u201con average, 38% of all stocks exhibit a PEG ratio below 1, which is more than enough for security selection.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, this ratio is often neglected due to investors' limitations in calculating the future earnings growth rate of a stock.\n\nThere are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio though. It does not consider the common situation of changing growth rates, such as the forecast of the first three years at a very high growth rate followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate in the long term.\n\nHence, PEG-based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are also taken into consideration.\n\nHere are the screening criteria for a winning strategy:\n\nPEG Ratio less than X Industry Median\n\nP/E Ratio (using F1) less than X Industry Median (For more accurate valuation purposes)\n\nZacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) (Whether good market conditions or bad, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1\u00a0or #2 have a proven history of success.)\n\nMarket Capitalization greater than $800 Million (This helps us to focus on companies that have strong liquidity.)\n\nAverage 20 Day Volume greater than 50,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.\n\nPercentage Change F1 Earnings Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than 5%: Upward estimate revisions add to the optimism, suggesting further bullishness.\n\nValue Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 (Hold) offer the best upside potential.\n\nHere are four out of the 11 stocks that qualified the screening:\n\nFord: Dearborn, MI-based Ford is one of the leading automakers in the world. It manufactures, markets and services cars, trucks, sport utility vehicles, electrified vehicles, and Lincoln luxury vehicles. Ford\u2019s vehicle lineup, supported by F-series trucks, Maverick pickup and SUV models, including Escape, Explorer, Expedition, EcoSport, and Edge, is impressive.\n\nFord is an impressive value investment pick with its Zacks Rank #1 and a Value Score of A. Apart from a discounted PEG and P/E, it also has an impressive long-term expected growth rate of 6.2%. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nToll Brothers: Based in Horsham, PA, Toll Brothers builds single-family detached and attached home communities; master planned luxury residential resort-style golf communities; and urban low, mid, and high-rise communities, principally on the land it develops and improves.\n\nToll Brothers can also be an impressive value investment pick with its Zacks Rank #2 and a Value Score of A. Apart from a discounted PEG and P/E, the stock has an impressive long-term historical growth rate of 23.9%.\n\nUrban Outfitters: Based in Philadelphia, PA, Urban Outfitters is a lifestyle specialty retailer that offers fashion apparel and accessories, footwear, home d\u00e9cor and gift products.

After all, the tens of millions of EVs that will be produced in the coming years will all need batteries. Or, as the prestigious consulting firm McKinsey put\u00a0it last October \u201cAs the auto market embraces electric vehicles, battery demand is soaring.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, it\u2019s not easy to produce EV batteries, as it\u2019s difficult to secure the materials needed to make the batteries. Therefore, the companies that are already managing to produce significant number of EV batteries have accomplished a meaningful feat and have a significant competitive advantage over those that are still trying to enter the sector.\n\nFurther, of course it\u2019s worth buying the stocks of battery makers whose products are meaningfully superior to those that are already on the market.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHere are three of the most undervalued battery stocks to buy in June:\n\nProterra (PTRA) Chinese EV Stocks. An image of an EV charging with other icons imposed over top; a lightning bolt, full battery, cogs\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nProterra (NASDAQ:PTRA) has entered a unique niche within the battery sector. Specifically, the company is specializing in making batteries \u201cfor heavy-duty electric vehicles.\u201d Given the many companies that are looking to buy more EVs in order to please consumers and/or comply with government regulations, this niche should be very lucrative over the long-term.\n\nMoreover, Proterra says that its batteries for large, commercial EVs are superior to competing products. According to the company, its batteries \u201chave industry-leading energy density for maximum range, a flexible design to fit within a wide variety of vehicles, and a ruggedized commercial grade housing to withstand harsh environments.\u201d\n\nBacking up Proterra\u2019s assertions, the revenue of its Proterra Powered and Energy unit, which includes its battery business, jumped 49% last quarter versus the same period a year earlier to $35 million.\n\nProterra\u2019s trailing price-sales ratio is a tiny 0.8, making it one of the most affordable battery stocks to buy.\n\nIn addition to batteries Proterra also sells electric buses and EV chargers. Analysts, on average, expect the company\u2019s top line to jump to $473 million this year versus $309 million last year.\n\nSolid Power (SLDP) Smartphone with logo of American battery company Solid Power Inc. on screen in front of business website. Focus on center-left of phone display.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSolid Power (NASDAQ:SLDP) has developed solid-state EV batteries. According to the company, its batteries contain more energy and are safer than the lithium-ion EV batteries that are widely used today. Moreover, SLDP reports that its batteries are safer and will last longer than their lithium-ion counterparts.\n\nThe company is already producing the specialized powder that will serve as the electrolyte of its solid-state batteries. In a year, SLDP plans to produce 2 to 3 metric tons of powder per month, and it intends to sell its excess powder to other battery makers and automakers.\n\nMoreover, SLDP plans to start delivering battery cells to its partners by December.\n\nSomewhat validating SLDP\u2019s technology, one of its partners, BMW (OTCMKTS:BMWYY), is researching the battery maker\u2019s technology and plans to build batteries based on SLDP\u2019s system at its own plants. What\u2019s more, BMW intends to start testing the batteries in EVs in 2023, suggesting that the batteries\u2019 development may be nearing completion.\n\nFurther, BMW and Ford (NYSE:F) have both invested significant amounts of money in SLDP.\n\nSolid Power\u2019s market capitalization is just $376 million, which is dozens if not hundreds of times below its long-term potential.\n\nPanasonic (PCRFY) A Panasonic (PCRFY) sign hanging in Beijing, China. generation z\n\nSource: testing/Shutterstock.com\n\nPanasonic (OTCMKTS:PCRFY) operates one EV battery factory in the U.S. in partnership with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). The company is also currently building another factory and reportedly has plans to launch a third.\n\nAs a result, I believe that the conglomerate is poised to benefit from huge increases in the revenue generated by its EV batteries in the U.S. over the longer term.\n\nAlso noteworthy is that Panasonic plans to increase the energy density of its EV batteries by 25% in 2030, likely giving them an important advantage over many competing products. And of course, Panasonic\u2019s partnership with Tesla should become more and more lucrative as the years go by.\n\nAnalysts, on average, expect the battery maker\u2019s EPS to jump to $1.35 next year from $1.10 this year.\n\nBased on the mean 2024 EPS estimate, the shares are changing hands for just 8.2 times the company\u2019s forward earnings.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F).\n\nReturn on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors\u2019 money. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.\n\nView our latest analysis for Ford Motor\n\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nReturn on equity can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Ford Motor is:\n\n6.2% = US$2.6b \u00f7 US$42b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).\n\nThe 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.06 in profit.\n\nDoes Ford Motor Have A Good ROE?\n\nArguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As shown in the graphic below, Ford Motor has a lower ROE than the average (23%) in the Auto industry classification. roe\n\nThat's not what we like to see. Although, we think that a lower ROE could still mean that a company has the opportunity to better its returns with the use of leverage, provided its existing debt levels are low. A company with high debt levels and low ROE is a combination we like to avoid given the risk involved. You can see the 4 risks we have identified for Ford Motor by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here.\n\nThe Importance Of Debt To Return On Equity\n\nVirtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.\n\nFord Motor's Debt And Its 6.2% ROE\n\nIt appears that Ford Motor makes extensive use of debt to improve its returns, because it has an alarmingly high debt to equity ratio of 3.30. The combination of a rather low ROE and high debt to equity is a negative, in our book.\n\nConclusion\n\nReturn on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.\n\nHaving said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward. So I think it may be worth checking this freereport on analyst forecasts for the company.\n\nOf course Ford Motor may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of other companies that have high ROE and low debt.\n\nHave feedback on this article? Concerned about the content?Get in touch with us directly.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk hopes the deal with Ford, the No. 2 seller of EVs in the U.S., will help make Tesla's technology the North American standard.\n\nNow those players face pressure to upgrade their networks to work with Tesla's at a time when many lag in customer service and lack the funds to make such a commitment.\n\nThe Biden administration did not respond to requests for comment, but Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg told CNBC after the Ford-Tesla deal that the administration was \"not going to pick winners and losers in terms of what standard prevails.\" He added the industry will eventually converge on one system but that adapters would allow cross usage.\n\nCharIn, a global association to promote CCS, said deals like the Tesla-Ford one \"create uncertainty in the industry and lead to investment obstacles.\"\n\nThe U.S. government previously set aside $7.5 billion in federal funds to push companies to adopt CCS as part of Biden's plan to tackle climate change by converting 50% of all new U.S. vehicle sales to EVs by 2030.\n\nHolding back EVs has been a weak CCS charging infrastructure that many complain is inefficient or sometimes inoperable, leading prospective buyers to fear becoming stranded on the road with nowhere to charge.\n\nBut installing and maintaining a charging network is capital-intensive and, with EVs representing only 6% of new car sales in the U.S. last year, making money in charging is difficult, industry officials said. Most automakers have not created their own charging networks.\n\nACCELERATE CHANGE\n\nThat financial pressure may only intensify if more companies adopt Tesla as the industry charging standard, pushing more deals like Shell's $169 million buyout of Volta earlier this year or BP's late 2021 acquisition of AMPLY Power.\n\n\"There was already some consolidation happening in the space and now I think that will only accelerate,\" Lazard banker Mohit Kohli said.\n\nThe Biden administration's push has so far supported the CCS connector favored by such carmakers as Volkswagen AG, General Motors Co and BMW. Tesla adopted that standard in Europe under pressure from regulators there, and is gradually opening a portion of its U.S. network to vehicles using CCS to potentially qualify for subsidies.\n\nComplaints about other charging companies' software bugs or broken charging hardware only opens the door to greater access for Tesla's standard, however, industry officials said.\n\nUnder its new deal, Ford will distribute Tesla adapters to customers and starting in 2025 will equip future EVs with NACS.

This particular vehicle is considered as the backbone of the automotive industry, especially in the U.S. But, as electrification transforms the entire industry, electrifying pickups can seem even more daunting for automakers compared to producing EVs. Besides the scary costs that come with EVs and make it harder for automakers to keep their finances in check, pickup makers are also in for other manufacturing and production challenges. For this reason, there\u2019s still no automaker that produces electric pickups at a scale. But the contenders are the EV king himself, Tesla. Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA), legacy automakers such as Ford Motor (NYSE: F) and General Motors (NYSE: GM), as well as EV startups like Rivian Automotive Inc (NASDAQ: RIVN). However, there are also players from the automotive parts field that can play a big part in the electric pickup race, such as Worksport Ltd (NASDAQ: WKSP).\n\nRivian Has Set The Benchmark\n\nThe EV startup currently has three models on the roads: a delivery van (the EDV), pickup truck (the R1T), and SUV (the R1S). Despite the usual startup and manufacturing pains, Rivian came close to meeting its 2022 production target of 25,000 units as its annual output amounted to\u00a024,337\u00a0units. It aims to double its output this year and it affirmed its guidance during the latest earnings report. Even if it loosens its ties with Amazon regarding exclusive delivery truck orders, it still counts on the tech titan as its investor for support.\n\nTesla\u2019s About To Throw Its Hat In The Electric Pickup Ring\n\nAlthough even the cash-abundant Tesla struggled more than it anticipated on this front. After several delays, its eagerly anticipated Cybertruck is finally coming by the end of the year with the initial production goal being 2021. But even if Tesla rolls it off the production line this year, mass production won\u2019t happen before 2024. When it comes to Tesla, Musk\u2019s quarterly investor calls are the place where one learns about the company\u2019s plans. The world still does not know much about the truck besides the fact it does not resemble any truck that exists on the market. Meanwhile, GM\u2019s\u00a0subsidiary, GMC is already selling the\u00a0Hummer EV.\u00a0While also pushing in the midsize pickup truck department,\u00a0GM has also announced the Chevrolet Silverado EV\u00a0and a\u00a0GMC Sierra EV, both of which could possibly hit production before Tesla\u2019s Cybertruck.\n\nFord Is Trying To Regain Its Pickup Supremacy\u00a0In The EV Universe\n\nFord has paused the production of its electric pickup, F-150 Lightning for almost a month this spring due to a battery issue. Its peer, Lordstown Motor Corporation (NASDAQ: RIDE) also halted production of its electric pickup Endurance back in February due to quality issues. So, regardless of the experience and the company\u2019s history, making electric pickups is no picnic for anyone. For this reason, Ford joined forces with Tesla to create its EV ecosystem. Ford\u2019s future vehicles will benefit directly from Tesla\u2019s supercharging infrastructure without needing an adapter. After this surprising move, Ford CEO Jim Farley predicts an acceleration of cooperation across the industry. If Farley\u2019s right, Tesla is on the way to change the charging norm of the industry.\n\nOn Wednesday, Farley stated that the challenging cost of EVs will remain higher compared to their ICE counterparts until the end of the decade. Simply put, it will take second and third generation models to come to life to achieve the know-how. As of 2030, Farley expects costs savings from smaller batteries and the fact that vehicles will require fewer parts.\n\nWorksport Can Help Those That Didn\u2019t Even Stand A\u00a0Chance Enter The Pickup Race\n\nThis renown tonneau cover manufacturer possibly has two game-changing products on its hands. The solar powered tonneau cover Terravis and the remote power storage COR promise to revolutionize truck beds. Hyundai has gained the right to use this potentially groundbreaking technology in its Santa Cruz SUV.\n\nWorksport\u2019s U.S. factory in New York already has the equipment installed, first materials have been received and skilled staff has been trained. This week, it officially launched\u00a0the SC4 PRO soft folding tonneau cover, and like all of its products, it is available on Amazon and Walmart. With its patented solar-powered accessories, Worksport will be able to help pickup makers in easing the challenges of the manufacturing battle.\n\nAll in all, bringing electric pickups to life turned out to be a daunting task even for the most powerful players. It is a competitive and challenging battle that is far from over, and therefore, cooperation in many forms and across the industry seems the inevitable and only way forward. It seems that pickups are the biggest EV challenge and\u00a0Ford is the first legacy automaker to acknowledge that only team effort can bring this electric\u00a0future to life.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

GPI recently made headlines with its latest acquisition of Beck & Masten Kia, a dealership located in the Houston metropolitan area. This strategic move expands Group 1's presence in the Houston market, bringing its total brands and dealerships in the area to 15 and 18, respectively. With expected annual revenues of $85 million, this acquisition contributes to Group 1's impressive year-to-date total acquired revenues of $1 billion.\n\nPresident and CEO of Group 1, Daryl Kenningham, expressed enthusiasm about the acquisition, highlighting the potential of the Kia brand in Houston. Kia America achieved record-breaking first-quarter sales, and Houston is the second fastest-growing major metropolitan area in the United States. Kenningham believes that this combination presents an excellent opportunity for Group 1 to capitalize on the thriving automotive market.\n\nShares of GPI have rallied more than 25% over the past year, outperforming the industry\u2019s growth of 5%.\n\nWhat\u2019s Driving GPI Stock?\n\nThe company's consistent acquisitions of dealerships and franchises demonstrate its commitment to expanding and optimizing its portfolio. Moreover, Group 1's previous acquisitions have already proven fruitful. The acquisition of Prime Automotive in the Northeastern United States and the Robinsons Group in the UK have diversified the company's footprint and are expected to contribute to its top-line growth. Since 2021, Group 1 has completed transactions representing $3.6 billion in acquired revenues.\n\nGroup 1's diversified product mix and multiple streams of income contribute to its appealing profile. The company generates revenues from various businesses, including used and new vehicle retail, finance, insurance, as well as automotive repair and maintenance. This diversified portfolio positions Group 1 well for both top and bottom-line growth. Group 1's omnichannel efforts to boost sales are another reason for investors to consider holding onto the stock. The company's digital initiatives, such as the online customer scheduling appointment system and the AcceleRide platform for online retailing, have significantly improved customer experience and productivity. Notably, units sold through AcceleRide experienced an impressive 117% year-over-year growth in the last reported quarter.\n\nThe company's investor-friendly moves also instill optimism among shareholders. Group 1 raised its 2023 annual dividend rate by 20%, demonstrating its commitment to rewarding shareholders. Additionally, the company has repurchased $35 million worth of shares, reflecting management's efficiency in capital allocation. Group 1's return on equity (ROE) of 31% compares favorably to the auto sector's 11.6%, further highlighting its commitment to maximizing shareholder value.\n\nA Few Concerns\n\nHowever, it is essential to consider potential headwinds surrounding the stock. The company's tight inventory, particularly for import and luxury brands, may result in lost revenues. With around 27% of Group 1's U.S. business relying on Toyota and Lexus, which face tight supply at only five days' worth, inventory constraints pose a challenge. Furthermore, the auto retail industry is susceptible to macroeconomic headwinds. Declining used vehicle prices and expected margin declines in the new vehicle segment could also limit Group 1's near-term prospects.\n\nBottom Line\n\nWhile challenges such as tight inventory, macroeconomic headwinds, and competition exist, closely monitoring GPI's ability to navigate these issues will be crucial. Overall, with its strategic acquisitions, resilient business model, and commitment to shareholder value, retaining GPI in an investment portfolio can offer the potential for long-term growth and returns.\n\nGroup 1 currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nKey Picks From the Auto Space\n\nA few better-ranked players in the auto space include Ford F, Stellantis STLA and BMW AG BAMXF.\n\nFord is one of the leading automakers in the world.

The increased production capacity will support the manufacturing of approximately 360,000 Chevrolet, Cadillac, GMC, Buick, and BrightDrop vehicles annually in the 2025-2030 timeframe in North America. By expanding the availability of EVs, major automakers are taking significant steps toward achieving cost parity with internal combustion engines and accelerating the adoption of clean and green transportation.\n\nThe collaboration will not only bolster GM's EV production capabilities but also generate employment opportunities. The investments made by GM and POSCO Future M will contribute to job creation across the North American region, stimulating economic growth and supporting local communities. The establishment of additional facilities for the on-site processing of critical minerals will also reduce reliance on imports, further enhancing the resilience of the EV supply chain.\n\nBy working together, GM and POSCO Future M are taking bold steps toward a cleaner and more sustainable future in the automotive industry.\n\nGM\u2019s Bid to Revamp EV Chain\n\nAs EVs take center stage in the automotive industry, General Motors has embarked on a strategic journey to fortify its EV supply chain. By securing raw materials, boosting cell manufacturing, and enhancing EV components production, GM aims to insulate itself against potential supply disruptions and accelerate its transition to electric mobility.\n\nBelow we highlight several partnerships and alliances that General Motors has entered into over the past couple of years, illustrating the company's commitment and forward-thinking strategy in the rapidly evolving EV landscape.\n\nGM embarked on its mission in July 2021, with a significant investment in Controlled Thermal Resources, targeting California-sourced lithium extraction. To ensure a steady supply of U.S.-sourced rare earth materials, the automaker formed an alliance with MP Materials in December 2021. The same month, GM announced a production initiative with POSCO Future M in Canada to produce CAM.\n\nContinuing this trend, GM secured a sustainable cobalt supply in April 2022 with Glencore, followed by a six-year agreement for battery-grade lithium with Livent in July 2022. In the same month, it inked a major supply agreement with LG Chem, promising GM over 950,000 tons of CAM, enough for approximately 5 million EVs. Additionally, GM established contracts with Queensland Pacific Metals and Vale for a long-term supply of nickel and cobalt, further reinforcing its supply chain.\n\nJanuary 2023 marked a significant milestone with a $650 million equity investment in Lithium Americas, leading to the development of the Thacker Pass lithium mine in Nevada.\n\nBeyond raw materials, GM has shown great commitment to cell manufacturing and R&D. The establishment of Ultium Cells LLC, a joint venture with LGES, and an alliance with Samsung SDI for a new U.S. battery cell plant demonstrates GM's vision. The Wallace Battery Cell Innovation Center in Warren, MI, further propels the automaker\u2019s endeavor for innovative, longer-range, and affordable EV batteries.\n\nGM's investment extends to EV components, with significant investments announced in Toledo, OH, for the production of drive units. A binding agreement with Vacuumschmelze ensures North America magnet production, and a new initiative to build EV motors at St. Catharines, Ontario, was declared in February 2023.\n\nIn conclusion, GM's strategic efforts reflect a firm commitment to establishing a secure and resilient EV supply chain, thus demonstrating an ambitious vision to lead the global shift toward electric mobility.\n\nZacks Rank & Other Key Picks\n\nGeneral Motors currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: BNP Paribas SA BNPQY, Ford Motor Company F and KBC Group NV KBCSY.\n\nHere are highlights from Friday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\n5 Reasons to Add BNPQY, F and KBCSY to Your Portfolio\n\nStock selection can be a tricky business in the best of times. Not only do you need to find stocks with good growth potential, but you also need to see that the potential in your selections exceeds that in other stocks out there. Otherwise you end up missing out on opportunities. Since we are always balancing inflation, the economy and our personal situation anyway, missing opportunities is obviously an undesired outcome.\n\nIf you\u2019re somebody who hasn\u2019t done a lot of investing in the past, there are a few simple rules.\n\nNumber one, start small. Use cash that you can afford to lose. And go for safe stocks. What these might be, we\u2019ll get to in a minute.\n\nPoint number two, even if the stock looks safe from a quick appraisal, learn more about the company. How does it generate revenue? Where? Does it manufacture its own products? Does it incorporate third-party components in its products? What could be the factors affecting revenue generation? Does it offer a service? What is the market demand for its product or service? Is it a growing market?\n\nThere could be so many questions to ask and answer. Therefore, do take the time to try and really understand the company. If you understand the company, you have a better idea of how economic factors may affect it.\n\nNumber three, talk to somebody who\u2019s been doing this for a while. You could pick up tips and tricks. If you\u2019re consulting an investment advisor, chances are they\u2019ll have a tailored strategy for you. One such strategy is outlined below. If you\u2019re feeling risk-averse, as its probably advisable to be when you\u2019re starting out, this strategy could work for you very well:\n\nGo Large: Large-cap stocks are typically those that have a market capitalization of more than $10 billion. They tend to be safer because they\u2019ve been in business longer. They\u2019re likely to have experienced management and a proven business model. They\u2019re also more likely to have relationships with suppliers and customers. All these factors help to make the business relatively stable in times of economic concern or when the business cycle turns down. The downside of investing in these stocks is that they usually have slower growth rates. So you may have to be more patient with them.\n\nPrefer Income: If you are to hold a stock for a considerable period of time and not get unnerved at all the market gyrations, it will help to see some income. Additionally, stocks that pay dividends add a layer of stability to share prices because dividends increase the total return. If you\u2019re not in need of cash, you may even use the dividend to increase your holdings. One downside to this is: in an inflationary market, the value of fixed dividends will deteriorate. But most companies also increase the dividend periodically, which may offset this to some extent.\n\nLook Forward: The way to understand the future prospects of a company is not only by studying its past performance, but also consulting the experts, or broker analysts. Analysts typically prepare models projecting past performance into the future. Thus, they\u2019re able to estimate earnings for the immediately following quarters and years, as well as for the long term.\n\nThe best part of investing in large-cap stocks is that there are usually a significant number of analysts following them, which provides us with average estimates, such as the Zacks Consensus Estimate. If you\u2019re planning to hold a stock for the long term, it may help to check the long-term growth estimates provided by analysts.\n\nChoose Attractive Industries: At any given time, the industry to which a company belongs has some bearing on its performance. There are almost always some factors that affect the entire industry. For example, a chip shortage last year impacted volumes of the entire auto industry, Similarly, rising oil prices were an important factor driving results at oil & gas companies.\n\nTherefore, if you choose industries with good long-term potential (such as EVs, AI, etc), this will increase your chances of success. Zacks makes this easier through its Industry Rank system, which is a way to rank industries that have been previously classified by Zacks. The number of Zacks-classified industries is around 250 and historical data shows that the top 50% outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of 2 to 1. Of course, the higher the rank, the greater the chances of outperformance.\n\nOther Tools from Zacks: At Zacks, we also have a system of ranking stocks based on the chances of their near-term performance. The Zacks Rank for stocks (#1 Strong Buy, #2 Buy, #3 Hold, #4 Sell and #5 Strong Sell) also captures recent estimate revisions. Zacks also has a Style Score System, which grades stocks based on their Value, Growth or Momentum potential. \u00a0Rank 1 and Value Score A or B.\n\nBNPQY, F and KBCSY satisfy all the criteria as good stocks to buy and hold now. So, let\u2019s take a look at some details:\n\nBNP Paribas SA\n\nBNP is a well-known brand providing banking and financial products and services in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, the Americas and the Asia Pacific. It operates in the Banks \u2013 Foreign industry, which is in the top 40% of Zacks-classified industries.\n\nThe Zacks Rank #1 stock with Value Score B is expected to grow 17.4% in the long term. It pays a dividend that yields 6.20% (very substantial).\n\nFord Motor Company\n\nFord develops, delivers and services a range of Ford trucks, commercial cars and vans, sport utility vehicles, and Lincoln luxury vehicles worldwide. It belongs to the Automotive \u2013 Domestic industry (top 29).\n\nThe Zacks Rank #1 stock has a Value Score A. It is expected to grow 6.2% in the long term. Its dividend yields 5.00%.\n\nKBC Group NV\n\nKBC provides integrated bank-insurance services primarily for retail, private banking, small and medium sized enterprises, and mid-cap clients. This is another player from the Banks \u2013 Foreign industry.\n\nThe Zacks Rank #1 stock with a Value Score of B is expected to grow 11.7% in the long term. Its dividend yields 6.69%.\n\nWhy Haven\u2019t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +6.2 average gain per year.

Accordingly, seeing all these popular large-cap stocks trading well over $100 per share can seem daunting. Nevertheless, there are plenty of stocks under $20 to consider investing in, that may provide similar upside to the more expensive names.\n\nMany companies that trade at or below the $20 per share mark still trade in large volume, have decent dividend yields, and even better long-term potential. Below are a few stocks that reach those criteria. These are companies I think investors should consider holding in their portfolio for the long-term.\n\nMPW Medical Properties Trust $8.25 F Ford $12.39 AAL American Airlines $14.87\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMedical Properties Trust (MPW) a wooden house shape holds 3 bags of cash representing reits to buy\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nMedical Properties Trust (NYSE:MPW) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that was founded in 2003 in Birmingham, Alabama. The company develops and acquires real estate assets, with a focus on medical facilities. The REIT holds over 400 properties globally in its portfolio, with the entire REIT currently valued around $5 billion. The company\u2019s portfolio is comprised of acute care hospitals, behavioral health clinics, and rehabilitation centers.\n\nIn April, Medical Properties Trust reported first quarter earnings, which showed a disappointing year-over-year revenue decline of 15%. Additionally, the company acquired no new property for the first quarter. However, the REIT\u2019s management team did predict acquisitions in Europe for the second quarter.\n\nOver the past year, rising interest rates have hit the real estate market hard. And Medical Properties Trust is no different. As a result, they have seen recent revenue and share price decline. But, a large footprint of medical facilities and projected acquisitions, and a potential rebound in the real estate market, make it a stock to keep an eye on. Alongside first-quarter earnings, the REIT announced a quarterly dividend of $0.29 per share.\n\nFord (F) Ford Go Electric Automobile Exhibition At Genoa, Italy. F stock\n\nSource: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com\n\nFord (NYSE:F) is perhaps one of the best-known auto manufacturers worldwide. The company produces a wide range of vehicles, but is most known for its line of pickup trucks and, more notably, its new electric truck, the Ford F-150 Lightning. They also own the brand Lincoln, their luxury line of vehicles, and offer auto financing and parts servicing.\n\nThe company reported its first quarter earnings in early-May. Net income came in at $1.6 billion, supported by impressive revenue growth of 20% on a year-over-year basis.\n\nFord has been heavily involved in the EV market as of late, releasing key models such as the Ford Lightning F-150, Mustang Mach-E, electric transit vans, and the electric Explorer crossover, which was announced in March. Additionally, Ford\u2019s stock price saw a 10% jump last week following the news of their partnership with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). This partnership will allow Ford customers to have access to Tesla\u2019s supercharger infrastructure starting in spring 2024.\n\nWith a decent grasp on the EV market, relative stability, and a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share, Ford is a stock to hold onto.\n\nAmerican Airlines (AAL) American Airlines plane on ramp in Chicago Airport. American Airlines is amongst the airlines cancelling flights\n\nSource: GagliardiPhotography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmerican Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), Headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas, is an international air carrier offering cargo and passenger transportation services. In 2015 the stock was added to the S&P 500 Index.\n\nIn April, the company released its first quarter earnings, posting a total revenue increase of 37% and earnings per share growth of 2 cents on a year-over-year basis. The airline industry has seen continued deemed for travel following the years of the pandemic. Thus, it shouldn\u2019t be a surprise that American Airlines has seen increased strength in its long-haul flight segment. The company saw nearly half a million record flights in the first quarter. This led to a strong forecast of earnings per share in Q2 to come in between $1.20 and $1.40 per share.\n\nThe airline industry is performing very well due to the strong travel demand, with growth in international and domestic air travel expected to continue. American Airlines is a key company in the airline industry, and is my top pick for investors looking for cheap stocks in the airline space.\n\nOn the date of publication, Noah Bolton held a long position in F stock.

To see more such stocks click 5 Hot Penny Stocks To Buy.\n\nInvesting in small-cap and micro-cap companies comes with a lot of volatility, surprises and risks. When broader markets are in turmoil, like they are ever since the inflation crisis started to hammer the global markets and the Federal Reserve started to raise rates, investing in small companies and penny stocks becomes even more risky as investors flock to stable, large-cap plays. But when markets begin to rebound small companies tend to perform better. For example, after the latest jobs report showed that the US labor market remains hot, the Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks jumped 3.2%, surpassing the S&P 500 gains of 1.5%. This is because when indicators point to robustness of the US economy, investors flock to small-cap stocks which are often focused on the domestic US market.\n\nSmall-cap stocks have been showing an upbeat trend since earlier this year when markets rebounded on hopes that the Federal Reserve will start hitting brakes on its interest rate hikes. According to a report from the WSJ, data from Refinitiv Lipper showed that investors poured a whopping $4.2 billion in U.S. mutual and exchange-traded funds that buy small-cap stocks in 2023 through February 22. Data also showed that investors pulled $17.4 billion from large-cap funds in the same period. Small-cap stocks were the second most-attractive investment option of investors this year after international stocks, which attracted $16 billion in the same period.\n\nCompare this outperformance to the bloodbath seen in small-cap stocks last year and you start to understand the investor appetite for risky stocks amid resilient economic growth. Small-cap stocks significantly underperformed the S&P 500 in 2022 as funds investing in small-cap plays saw outflows of a whopping $28.5 billion, according the WSJ. The Journal quoted Rayna Lesser Hannaway, a portfolio manager at Polen Capital, who said that the market has been anticipating a recession for quite some time now and she \u201chopes\u201d that companies\u2019 management teams are taking smart decisions today to weather economic storms of tomorrow.\n\nHannaway co-manages the The Polen US Small Company Growth fund, which is up about 10% year to date as of June 3.\n\nAnother reason why investors are preferring small-cap stocks is their attractive valuations. The WSJ report quoted Jim Masturzo, chief investment officer of multiasset strategies at Research Affiliates, who said that his firm is expecting the Russell 2000 index to return about 5% a year over the next 10 years. This would be more than double the 1.9% return he expects to see from the S&P 500.\n\nWhile small-cap stocks are gaining attention this year, when it comes to penny stocks, the rules of the game change since penny stock investing comes with a lot of risks and a peculiar stigma attached to invest.\n\nDoes Investing in Penny Stocks Make Sense?\n\nAn interesting study titled The Cross-section of Expected Returns on Penny Stocks - Are Low-hanging Fruits Not-so Sweet? which analyzes the Indian penny stock space mentions the allure of penny stocks and the risks attached in the following words:\n\n\u201cAnother important attribute of penny stocks is that they carry huge potential for profits for those investors who are high risk-seekers as these stocks carry high risk mainly because of information asymmetry, low liquidity, and uncertainty related to the fundamentals of such companies. The asymmetric information leads to under- valuation of penny stocks. This essentially enables aggressive investors to find the right kind of penny stocks and presents huge profit potential. While the penny stocks are highly risky and carry high potential for returns, they are cheaply available hence can be invested in easily by even small retail investors who might not have deep pockets. It is, therefore, penny stocks seem a tempting investment choice for small retail investors. However, due to high risk attribute, if wrongly traded, penny stocks might prove detrimental for small retail investors.\u201d\n\nWhile penny stocks seem risky, it\u2019s important to note that many successful companies today were once trading as penny stocks. The market is always offering opportunities and there are always companies that trade for price tags under $5 or $10. For example, some stable companies that are trading under $10 today include BlackBerry Ltd (NYSE:BB), Plug Power Inc (NASDAQ:PLUG) and Sirius XM Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:SIRI).\n\nFord Motor Co (NYSE:F), one of the biggest car companies in the world, was trading at around $2 back in 1983. Back in 2008, Apple\u2019s stock price was around $3.2. Today the company\u2019s market cap stands at $2.8 trillion.\n\nWisdom from Billionaire Howard Marks\n\nIn 2011, billionaire Howard Marks, in a memo to his clients, talked about his meeting with Charlie Munger where they discussed Marks\u2019 book The Most Important Thing. Marks in the memo talks about some key themes which show the importance of setting your expectations right before investing. Marks recalled how Charlie Munger said during the meeting that anyone who thinks the investing world is easy was wrong.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not supposed to be easy. Anyone who finds it easy is stupid.\u201d\n\nMarks then goes on to elaborate what it takes to win in the stock investing world and how to make contrarian bets that actually pay off. For that he uses two levels of thinking: first-level thinking and second-level thinking. Here\u2019s how Marks explains these systems:\n\nFor example, when I lived in Los Angeles, a stockbroker often spoke on the radio station I listened to while driving to work. His advice was simple: \u201cIf there\u2019s a company whose product you like, buy the stock.\u201d That\u2019s first-level thinking. How seductively easy. But also how error-prone, in that it ignores the possibility that a company with a good product can have a bad business; the good product can become obsolete; or the stock can be priced too high to be a good investment. On the other hand, second-level thinkers double-think (and triple-think) every angle of every situation. A good example can be seen in the hypothetical newspaper contest John Maynard Keynes wrote about in 1936. Readers would be shown 100 photos and asked to choose the six prettiest girls, with prizes going to the readers who chose the girls readers voted for most often. Naive entrants would try to win by picking the prettiest girls. But note that the contest would reward the readers who chose not the prettiest girls, but the most popular. Thus the road to winning would lie not in figuring out which were the prettiest, but in predicting which girls the average entrant would consider prettiest. Clearly, to do so, the winner would have to be a second-level thinker. (The first-level thinker wouldn\u2019t even recognize the difference.)\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 943 hedge funds and picked 10 penny stocks (stocks priced under $5) that have posted strong gains in the past thirty days through June 1 and have the highest number of hedge fund investors.\n\n10.
