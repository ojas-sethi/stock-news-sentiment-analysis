A bigger labor pool is easing pressure on businesses to raise wages and helping decelerate inflation.\n\n\"While it appears to be a hot number on the actual number of people employed, the wage rate is not increasing as fast,\" said Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners in Pittsburgh. \"That is a softening effect and is this the mythical soft landing? Looks like that.\"\n\nThe data brought relief to investors who mostly expect the Fed to pause hiking rates at its policy meeting on June 13-14. It would be the first halt since the Fed started its aggressive anti-inflation policy tightening more than a year ago.\n\nBut some pointed to the much hotter-than-expected jobs data as a sign the Fed still has not yet tamed inflation.\n\n\"Our view is and has been that the market is completely wrong on assessing what the Federal Reserve is doing,\" said Phil Orlando, chief equity strategist at Federated Hermes in New York.\n\n\"The market's perception is that this economy was going to cool, inflation was going to collapse and the Fed was going to turn around and start cutting interest rates. That's wrong.\"\n\nFed funds futures showed a 71.3% probability that the Fed will hold rates steady in two weeks, down from 79.6% on Thursday, according to CME Group's FedWatch Tool.\n\nMarkets now await data on key consumer prices a day before the Fed's rate decision in two weeks.\n\nThe Senate passing a bill late on Thursday to lift the government's $31.4 trillion debt ceiling avoided what would have been a catastrophic, first-ever default.\n\nPassage of the vote eased investor concerns as Wall Street's fear gauge, the CBOE volatility index, fell to its lowest since November 2021, down 1.1 points at 14.6 points.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 701.19 points, or 2.12%, to 33,762.76, the S&P 500 gained 61.35 points, or 1.45%, to 4,282.37 and the Nasdaq Composite added 139.78 points, or 1.07%, to 13,240.77.\n\nFor the week, the S&P 500 rose 1.82%, the Dow added 2.02% and the Nasdaq gained 2.04%\n\nVolume on U.S. exchanges was 11.05 billion shares, compared with about 10.58 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.\n\nShares of Verizon Communications Inc, AT&T Inc and T-Mobile US Inc declined after a report said Amazon.com Inc was in talks with the U.S. telecoms to offer low-cost wireless services to its Prime members.\n\nVerizon slid 3.2%, while AT&T and T-Mobile declined 3.8% and 5.6%, respectively; Amazon gained 1.2%.\n\nAll 11 S&P 500 sectors advanced, with the materials index leading, up 3.4%, and the consumer discretionary sector, housing Amazon, close behind, rising 2.2%.\n\nNvidia Corp slid 1.1% for a second day of declines after briefly entering on Wednesday the elite club of megacap stocks valued at $1 trillion or more on hopes artificial intelligence will deliver significant future returns.\n\nBut Nvidia's almost 170% rise year to date highlights investors face of a market dominated by the out-performance of megacaps while most other companies tread water.\n\n\"Nobody\u2019s really explained to me how they\u2019re going to make any money from it,\" said Michael Landsberg, chief investment officer at Landsberg Bennett Private Wealth Management in Punta Gorda, Florida. \"A company like Nvidia going up so much in such a short period of time, that doesn't make any rational sense.\"\n\nAdvancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 4.75-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.73-to-1 ratio favored advancers.\n\nThe S&P 500 posted 15 new 52-week highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 74 new highs and 40 new lows.\n\n(Reporting by Herbert Lash, additional reporting by Shreyashi Sanyal, Shristi Achar A and Shashwat Chauhan, in Bengaluru; Editing by Nivedita Bhattacharjee and Maju Samuel)", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-stocks-wall-street-ends-202219171.html", "symbols": ["BAC.F", "BAC.XETRA", "DJI.INDX", "GSPC.INDX", "IXIC.INDX", "NVD.F", "NVD.XETRA", "NVDA.MX", "NVDA.US", "NVDC34.SA", "VERZ34.SA", "VZ.MX", "VZ.US"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.989, "neg": 0.065, "neu": 0.818, "pos": 0.117}}, {"date": "2023-06-02T20:16:35+00:00", "title": "Why AT&amp;T, Verizon, and T-Mobile Stocks Were Sinking Today", "content": "Telecom stocks including AT&T (NYSE: T), Verizon (NYSE: VZ), and T-Mobile (NASDAQ: TMUS) were all pulling back Friday on some surprising news.

Investors have begun to pour back into the stock market in search of bargains. However, despite high returns in growth stocks, investors are still highly interested in seeking lower-risk securities. A typical way to go about doing that is to invest in high-yield exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nHigh-yield ETFs\u00a0hold stocks paying above-average dividends or bonds making above-average interest payments. Some common high-yield ETFs include Vanguard High Yield Dividend ETF (NYSEARCA:VYM), which has exposure to well-established large-cap companies, such as JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and iShares Select Dividend ETF (NASDAQ:DVY), which has exposure to household names like Verizon (NYSE:VZ).\n\nFor those income investors in search of high yields, below is a list of three stocks that these high-yield ETFs are betting on.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAltria (MO) Altria office sign in Virginia capital city tobacco business closeup by road street\n\nSource: Kristi Blokhin / Shutterstock.com\n\nAltria (NYSE:MO) manufactures and sells smokable and oral tobacco products. The company provides cigarettes under the well-known Marlboro brand. Its cigars and pipe tobacco are principally sold under the Black & Mild brand. Despite cigarettes and tobacco products being generally frowned upon in the U.S., Altria was able to rake in $25 billion in net revenue in fiscal year 2022.\n\nMost importantly, the company paid a whopping $6.6 billion in dividends that year. These days, Altria\u2019s dividend yield sits around 8.7%. Because of this, the company is included in a number of high-yield ETFs. For example, the iShares Select Dividend ETF has Altria as its largest holding at 2.59% of its $19.5 billion assets under management (AUM). First Trust Morningstar Dividend Leaders Index Fund (NYSEARCA:FDL), a $4 billion high-yield ETF, holds Altria Group at nearly 5% of AUM.\n\nRecessions tend to have varying impact on smokers and non-smokers. Research has showed smokers tend to consume fewer tobacco products during a time of deteriorating economic outlook, while those new to smoking tend to pick up the habit. Although it is not sure which side of the coin will land for Altria, the company will most likely keep its high dividend. After all, it has increased its dividend 53 consecutive times.\n\nBlackstone Secured Lending Fund (BXSL) Business Development Company BDC concept is shown by businessman.\n\nSource: wsf-s / Shutterstock.com\n\nBlackstone Secured LendingFund (NYSE:BXSL) is a business development company (BDC) owned by the major asset management firm Blackstone (NYSE:BX). Acting as a financial services company, BXSL offers mainly senior secured loans to U.S.-based private companies. These companies range across various sectors, including software, healthcare, insurance, aerospace and air freight.\n\nAs of March 31, the company\u2019s portfolio investments were valued at $9.6 billion in fair value. Nearly 98% of these investments are first lien senior secured, with over 99% of the debt investments carrying a floating rate. Currently, BXSL\u2019s portfolio consists of loans provided to 49 companies. Loan amounts ranging from approximately $67 million to over $348 million.\n\nBlackstone Secured Lending\u2019s dividend as of its Q1 2023 net asset value (NAV) was 10.7%. Furthermore,\u00a0there are many high-yield ETFs holding the stock. The VanEck BDC Income ETF (NYSEARCA:BIZD), for one, has a 4.72% concentration in BXSL.\n\nAlthough the lending markets have cooled since the U.S. Federal Reserve began hiking interest rates, investors have remained committed to reallocating capital to private credit vehicles as they continue to look for high yields. This, coupled with the fact BXSL is backed by a larger, well-established asset manager, should bode well for both the BDC and its high dividend payments in the long term.\n\nPetrobras (PBR) the Petroleo Brasileiro logo on a building during daylight\n\nSource: A.PAES / Shutterstock.com\n\nFounded in 1953 and headquartered in Rio de Janeiro,\u00a0Petrobras (NYSE:PBR) is the state-run oil and natural gas behemoth from Brazil. Through selling oil and gas domestically and internationally, the company has business operations in exploration, production, refining, transportation, gas and power.\n\nIn 2022, global commodity prices skyrocketed, and elevated energy prices allowed Petrobras to profit immensely. In particular, Petrobras made $121 billion in revenue and $38 billion in net income. Its performance primarily came from the appreciation of the average Brent price for the year and higher sales of oil products, at higher average prices, in the Brazilian domestic market.\n\nPetrobras\u2019s large net income translated into huge dividends for shareholders. The company doled out more than $43 billion in dividend payments in 2022. Although Brent prices are stabilizing, Petrobras remains profitable and undervalued. In fact, PBR\u2019s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio on a trailing-12-month basis is only around 2x. Its dividend yield is at 32%.\n\nThe Amplify International Enhanced Dividend Income ETF (NYSEARCA:IDVO) is one of the high-yield ETFs betting on Petrobras. The company is the ETF\u2019s third-largest holding.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Amazon has been talking with wireless carriers about offering Prime subscribers $10 a month or possibly for free and bolster loyalty among its biggest spending customers. The company is negotiating with\u00a0Verizon Communications Inc (NYSE: VZ), T-Mobile US Inc (NYSE: TMUS), and Dish for the lowest possible wholesale prices, Bloomberg reported citing knowledgeable sources. The discussions have been going on for six to eight weeks and have also included\u00a0AT&T Inc (NYSE: T) at times. Amazon's deal could act as a breather for the wireless industry in the form of wholesale revenue and traffic to newly expanded 5G networks. But it could also chip away at the big carriers' customer base left with minimal bargaining power after pouring billions of dollars into super-fast, high-capacity 5G wireless networks. As a result, TMUS, VZ, and T stocks are trading lower Friday. Analysts say U.S. Prime membership has stagnated since Amazon boosted the annual price from $119 to $139 for privileges like speedy free delivery, video streaming, and access to 100 million songs. Amazon is vying with\u00a0Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT), whose $98-a-year Walmart+ membership proved attractive as a lower-cost alternative offering many of the same perks as Prime and free grocery delivery on orders of at least $35. Amazon spokesperson confirms the earlier report to Benzinga, \"We are always exploring adding even more benefits for Prime members, but don\u2019t have plans to add wireless at this time.\" Amazon in February raised its free grocery delivery threshold to $150 from $35. Dish is already working with Amazon, whose AWS division provides cloud computing to run the core network for its wireless service. Dish will also likely start selling its Boost Infinite wireless service on Amazon by July. Price Actions: DISH is trading higher by 20% at $7.55 on the last check Friday.

That would let it offer Prime members wireless plans for $10 a month or possibly for free and bolster loyalty among its biggest spending customers, the people said, who requested anonymity to discuss a private matter.\n\nThe talks have been going on for six to eight weeks and have also included AT&T Inc. at times, but the plan may take several more months to launch and could be scrapped, one person said.\n\nDish shares jumped 14% Friday in New York since a deal with the retail giant could help the struggling satellite-TV company as it transitions to become a national wireless carrier. Meanwhile, T-Mobile fell 8.4%, AT&T dropped 5% and Verizon slid 3.5.%. The big three national carriers could see their own subscribers flee to a cheaper option at Amazon. Deutsche Telekom AG, which holds a majority stake in T-Mobile, fell 5.7% in Germany.\n\n\u201cWe are always exploring adding even more benefits for Prime members, but don\u2019t have plans to add wireless at this time,\u201d Amazon spokesperson Maggie Sivon said in a statement. Verizon and Dish declined to comment.\n\nAmazon\u2019s US Prime subscribers pay $139 a year for privileges like speedy free delivery, video streaming and access to 100 million songs. Analysts say Prime membership has stagnated in the country since Amazon boosted the annual price from $119, a sign that a subscription is less attractive to consumers struggling with a stubbornly high inflation rate. About 167 million Amazon shoppers had Prime memberships as of March, unchanged from a year earlier, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners.\n\nAmazon is competing with Walmart Inc., whose $98-a-year Walmart+ membership is emerging as a lower-cost alternative offering many of the same perks as Prime and free grocery delivery on orders of at least $35. Amazon in February increased its free grocery delivery threshold to $150 from $35.\n\nAmazon\u2019s Influence\n\nFor the wireless industry, an Amazon deal could be seen as a welcome boost to wholesale revenue and a way to attract more traffic to newly expanded 5G networks. But Amazon\u2019s entry could be detrimental if Prime wireless becomes popular and starts to chip away at the big carriers\u2019 customer base.\n\nA deeply below-market price from one of the world\u2019s largest retailers could easily undercut the pricing power of the big three national carriers, making it tempting for subscribers to go to Amazon. Unlimited plans start at $60 a month at Verizon and T-Mobile, with AT&T starting at $65.\n\nWith Prime wireless, Amazon would become a new national brand, reselling mobile service from one of the big three carriers. The retailer could choose to offer wireless to its Prime members at an attractive price, prompting customers to cancel their current mobile service. Or, Amazon could go wider and offer Prime wireless to anyone who wants to switch service and become a Prime member.\n\nAnytime Amazon enters a new market, it sends shivers through the industry because the Seattle-based retail giant has shown it\u2019s willing to absorb billions of dollars in shipping and movie production costs to fuel Prime membership growth. Wireless service could be just one more item that Amazon\u2019s willing to take a hit on if it gives the company a leg up versus Walmart.\n\nCan\u2019t Say No\n\nThe carriers aren\u2019t really in a position to say no to Amazon. Having poured billions of dollars into super-fast, high capacity 5G wireless networks, the mobile operators have little to show for the effort and are eager to find new applications and sales outlets that can generate some return on the investment.\n\nDish has the most to gain from a deal with Amazon.

That would let it offer Prime members wireless plans for $10 a month or possibly for free and bolster loyalty among its biggest spending customers, the people said, who requested anonymity to discuss a private matter.\n\nDish shares jumped 8.4% in premarket trading on Friday while Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile all slid more than 5%.\n\nThe talks have been going on for six to eight weeks and have also included AT&T Inc. at times, but the plan may take several more months to launch and could be scrapped, one person said.\n\n\u201cWe are always exploring adding even more benefits for Prime members, but don\u2019t have plans to add wireless at this time,\u201d Amazon spokesperson Maggie Sivon said in a statement. Verizon and Dish declined to comment.\n\nAmazon\u2019s US Prime subscribers pay $139 a year for privileges like speedy free delivery, video streaming and access to 100 million songs. Analysts say Prime membership has stagnated in the country since Amazon boosted the annual price from $119, a sign that a subscription is less attractive to consumers struggling with a stubbornly high inflation rate. About 167 million Amazon shoppers had Prime memberships as of March, unchanged from a year earlier, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners.\n\nAmazon is competing with Walmart Inc., whose $98-a-year Walmart+ membership is emerging as a lower-cost alternative offering many of the same perks as Prime and free grocery delivery on orders of at least $35. Amazon in February increased its free grocery delivery threshold to $150 from $35.\n\nAmazon\u2019s Influence\n\nFor the wireless industry, an Amazon deal could be seen as a welcome boost to wholesale revenue and a way to attract more traffic to newly expanded 5G networks. But Amazon\u2019s entry could be detrimental if Prime wireless becomes popular and starts to chip away at the big carriers\u2019 customer base.\n\nA deeply below-market price from one of the world\u2019s largest retailers could easily undercut the pricing power of the big three national carriers, making it tempting for subscribers to flee to Amazon. Unlimited plans start at $60 a month at Verizon and T-Mobile, with AT&T starting at $65.\n\nWith Prime wireless, Amazon would become a new national brand, reselling mobile service from one of the big three carriers. The retailer could choose to offer wireless to its Prime members at an attractive price, prompting customers to cancel their current mobile service. Or, Amazon could go wider and offer Prime wireless to anyone who wants to switch service and become a Prime member.\n\nAnytime Amazon enters a new market, it sends shivers through the industry because the Seattle-based retail giant has shown it\u2019s willing to absorb billions of dollars in shipping and movie production costs to fuel Prime membership growth. Wireless service could be just one more item that Amazon\u2019s willing to take a hit on if it gives the company a leg up versus Walmart.\n\nCan\u2019t Say No\n\nThe carriers aren\u2019t really in a position to say no to Amazon. Having poured billions of dollars into super-fast, high capacity 5G wireless networks, the mobile operators have little to show for the effort and are eager to find new applications and sales outlets that can generate some return on the investment.\n\nDish has the most to gain from a deal with Amazon. The struggling satellite-TV company is attempting to transform itself into a cloud-based wireless carrier capable of competing with Verizon and AT&T. But it\u2019s carrying a load of distressed debt and is seeking new avenues of funding to be able to launch its Boost Infinite wireless service. Dish is already working with Amazon, whose AWS division is providing cloud computing to run the core network for its wireless service and is expected to start selling Boost Infinite wireless service on Amazon as soon as next month.\n\nAmazon has already made several forays into wireless.

All are high-quality firms, meaning they\u2019re stable and have the potential to continue growing. Granted, it might be hard to imagine some of these companies getting bigger. But that\u2019s exactly what some detractors surely said a decade ago. The truth is that many of the best stocks of today will be the best stocks in a decade. Strong companies have many ways to maintain their dominance, including these seven.\n\nStocks for Investment Until 2033: Apple (AAPL) man's hand holding wads of cash. stocks to buy. Stocks With 1000% Upside\n\nSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.com\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a no-brainer. Over the last decade alone, it\u2019s become so omnipresent in our way of life that it\u2019s hard to suggest it won\u2019t continue to dominate. Better, its fan base is fervent, which won\u2019t change any time soon. Those simple factors alone suggest that Apple is one of the most obvious long-term stock choices to invest in today. Further, Apple has grown so fast that it\u2019s become very attractive to those determined not to miss out on gains this time around.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBack in 2013, AAPL shares traded at $15. Today they\u2019re worth $175. No one knows precisely where they\u2019ll be in 10 years but this forecast expects prices near $500. Investors should also consider that as Apple continues to mature that it will continue to raise its dividends as well.\n\nStocks for Investment Until 2033: Microsoft (MSFT) An image of a street sign post with directions labeled \"Buy\", \"Hold\", and \"Sell\"\n\nSource: PX Media / Shutterstock\n\nBig Tech firms, like Microsoft, (NASDAQ:MSFT) have every chance of being just as strong as they are now in 10 years. Thanks in large part to the AI boom.\n\nMicrosoft has arguably set itself apart with a massive foray into AI ahead of others. The OpenAI investment gives it a first-mover advantage that will continue to matter. Google (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL) has responded more slowly even as it makes inroads.\n\nThe other obvious question here is if AI is the future, why not invest in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)? Granted, there\u2019s a strong case favoring Nvidia after its Q1 results for sure. It continues to make all the sense in the world, honestly. The only issue is that the chip sector\u2019s cyclicality is very unpredictable making NVDA especially volatile. Therefore, holding for a decade may not be the best strategy.\n\nStocks for Investment Until 2033: Block (SQ) Man holding stacks of money. top growth stocks\n\nSource: Epic Cure / Shutterstock\n\nFintech stocks including Block (NYSE:SQ) hold massive potential. Over the next decade or so, consumers will continue to demand more modern methods of banking and financial services. Block\u2019s current size, position, and growth mean that it is the best overall fintech stock to hold over that period.\n\nLet\u2019s pull back and consider the landscape here. Boston Consulting Group expects compound annual growth of 17% for U.S. fintech through 2030. Fintech revenues should grow from $245 billion to $1.5 trillion based on data released in early May. The sector is going to make a lot of investors rich in the coming years.\n\nBlock is the clear U.S. pick here. Truly risk-forward investors should consider Asian firms where 32% annual growth is expected through 2030. Square continues to be a massive part of Block\u2019s performance. But Cash App has become an even bigger profit-generating machine for the company. Block continues to be positioned to capture that growth in the U.S. market.\n\nWalmart (WMT)  hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocks\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/CC7\n\nI once read that Walmart (NYSE:WMT) fairly represents the U.S. economy. The idea was simple \u2014 Walmart offers a wide cross-section of the goods and services Americans buy. So, I\u2019m sure there\u2019s some truth to that notion.\n\nHowever, from a growth perspective, Walmart outpaces the U.S. For example, U.S. GDP grew by 1.6% in the first quarter. GDP is a summation of the value of all the goods and services produced so it\u2019s roughly analogous to revenue. And Walmart\u2019s revenues increased by 7.6% in the first quarter so it continues to be a growth machine.\n\nWhat many might not recognize when discussing Walmart is that the company is fast becoming an eCommerce force. eCommerce grew by 27% domestically and by 25% internationally. Walmart is not content to dominate brick-and-mortar retail. It is going to continue to chip away at Amazon (NASDAQ:\u00a0AMZN) and other eCommerce-first firms well into the future.\n\nJPMorgan Chase (JPM) tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocks\n\nSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.com\n\nJPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) has already shown investors the strategy it uses when it shrewdly took advantage of the recent banking collapse. While acting as a bulwark against total collapse, the company simultaneously played big brother and calculating advisor. It pledged funds to prevent a collapse of regional banks, sure. But it also swooped in and took what it wanted from First Republic: Wealthy coastal clientele.\n\nJPMorgan Chase intends to get bigger \u2013 it\u2019s already the largest bank in the U.S. \u2013 and become higher quality. It is getting bigger and making deeper inroads with the coastal elite. Unsurprisingly that has ruffled feathers and furthered divisions with political lines. In fact, GOP states have sent a letter to the company for religious bias in lending practices.\n\nHow does this all relate to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s long-term prospects? It means the bank has become more entrenched with coastal wealth and the political associations therewith. That\u2019s where the money is for the most part with tech in the west and finance in the east. It means the bank should only get stronger.\n\nApplied Materials (AMAT)  a green button on a keyboard has an arrow pointing upward with the word \"Buy\". representing safe stocks to buy\n\nSource: AdityaB. Photography/ShutterStock.com\n\nApplied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) provides goods in the form of manufacturing equipment and services as software to the chip sector. It\u2019s basically a high-quality stock that runs adjacent to the semiconductor industry and has growth prospects aplenty. The semiconductor industry should reach $1 trillion in revenues by 2030. That assumes 6% to 10% annual growth over the intervening years.\n\nAMAT has been a tremendous growth stock over the last decade, providing 25.75% returns annually. Any investment placed 10 years ago and left untouched would have multiplied in value nearly 10 times. Some of that growth was due to 20% industry-wide growth in 2021 during the chip boom. Such spikes are unpredictable. But even absent that spike AMAT shares grew rapidly in the run-up.\n\nOne of my favorite ways to predict if a company will produce gains over time is by comparing returns on invested capital to the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The greater the discrepancy, the better. Applied Materials\u2019 ROIC is 33.92% and its ROIC is 9.68%.\n\nVerizon (VZ) image of businessperson and bar graph with dollar signs to represent undervalued stocks\n\nSource: Wright Studio/Shutterstock.com\n\nThe Verizon (NYSE:VZ) stock has not done well over the last decade. It provided 1.73% returns annually during the last decade. That means $1,000 would have grown to a \u201cmassive\u201d $1,137 if left untouched. However, Verizon\u2019s past, hopefully, won\u2019t be its future.\n\nThe reason so many investors are keen on Verizon is 5G. The 5G market is expected to grow by roughly 60% annually between 2023 and 2030. Forget the recent past and embrace the potential of the future in other words. That\u2019s what is required of investors in VZ stock over the coming years.\n\nVerizon, though, is doing its part to sweeten that deal. It offers a dividend yielding 7.43% currently that hasn\u2019t been reduced since 2000. That means investors get an actual return that is much higher in reality as long as Verizon continues to pay shareholders to hold onto their stock. Further, VZ stock has roughly 20% upside right now based on its target price.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

To address that increase in data usage and prepare for the continued influx expected throughout the summer months, Verizon has recently made major upgrades to the network serving customers in Orlando, FL. These upgrades are part of a multi-year redesign of its network architecture to stay ahead of exponential data usage increases, upgrade the technology in the network, and to pave the way for personalized customer experiences. Network upgrades in Orlando include deploying new cell sites to extend coverage and capacity in local communities. They also include adding more capacity on fiber optic cables to move more data through the network and adding bandwidth to the cellular network to accommodate new services like wireless internet service for homes and businesses. Specifics on the upgrades include:\n\nEngineers have deployed 5G Ultra Wideband service using Millimeter Wave (mmWave), its premium, high-band spectrum which allows for extremely fast speeds and massive capacity as well as C-band spectrum designed for fast speeds, high capacity and wide coverage. 5G Ultra Wideband service is now available around Gotha, CasselBerry, along University Blvd and 417 in the Summer Woods area, University Blvd, Icon park, the Orlando Outlet Market, the South Orange area, Sea World, and Disney Blizzard Beach. Orlando\u2019s 5G coverage uses a combination of mmWave spectrum and Verizon\u2019s recently acquired C-band spectrum.\u00a0 Verizon engineers are using 60 MHz of C-band spectrum to deliver 5G service to customers. By the end of the year, customers in Orlando will be able to take advantage of more than twice that amount of spectrum as it becomes available for 5G Ultra Wideband.\u00a0 That additional bandwidth will turbo charge the service, offering significantly higher speeds, much greater capacity to accommodate more customers and more robust services. Lastly, the addition of 5G service and the many additional wireless solutions allow far more data to travel on the wireless network in Orlando. That exponential increase in data carried into and out of the cell sites serving the community requires upgraded fiber optic cable links.\u00a0 Fiber optic cables are used to move data between cell sites and connect those sites to the rest of the network.\u00a0 Verizon has increased the capacity on the fiber connections in many cell sites in the Orlando area so they can carry 10 times the amount of data.\n\n\u201cWe know residents and visitors to Orlando count on us for reliable, secure, communication, and we are working hard to keep up with the significant increase in demand we are seeing in Orlando to ensure we deliver for them,\u201d said Eric Lia, Vice President of Engineering and Operations for Verizon. \u201cThe investments we\u2019ve made in the recent past have made a big difference in the level of service customers in Orlando are receiving, and we are not slowing down with our upgrades in this market.\u201d\n\nWith these and other technology advancements on Verizon\u2019s network, customers are able to use more data in more ways.

To address that increase in data usage and prepare for the continued influx expected throughout the summer months, Verizon has recently made major upgrades to the network serving customers in Orlando, FL. These upgrades are part of a multi-year redesign of its network architecture to stay ahead of exponential data usage increases, upgrade the technology in the network, and to pave the way for personalized customer experiences. Network upgrades in Orlando include deploying new cell sites to extend coverage and capacity in local communities. They also include adding more capacity on fiber optic cables to move more data through the network and adding bandwidth to the cellular network to accommodate new services like wireless internet service for homes and businesses. Specifics on the upgrades include:\n\nEngineers have deployed 5G Ultra Wideband service using Millimeter Wave (mmWave), its premium, high-band spectrum which allows for extremely fast speeds and massive capacity as well as C-band spectrum designed for fast speeds, high capacity and wide coverage. 5G Ultra Wideband service is now available around Gotha, CasselBerry, along University Blvd and 417 in the Summer Woods area, University Blvd, Icon park, the Orlando Outlet Market, the South Orange area, Sea World, and Disney Blizzard Beach.Orlando\u2019s 5G coverage uses a combination of mmWave spectrum and Verizon\u2019s recently acquired C-band spectrum.\u00a0 Verizon engineers are using 60 MHz of C-band spectrum to deliver 5G service to customers. By the end of the year, customers in Orlando will be able to take advantage of more than twice that amount of spectrum as it becomes available for 5G Ultra Wideband.\u00a0 That additional bandwidth will turbo charge the service, offering significantly higher speeds, much greater capacity to accommodate more customers and more robust services.Lastly, the addition of 5G service and the many additional wireless solutions allow far more data to travel on the wireless network in Orlando.
