EPS Decline: Full-year 2023 EPS was $2.75, down from $5.06 in 2022; adjusted EPS of $4.71, excluding special items. Operating Revenue Dip: Total operating revenue for full-year 2023 was $134.0 billion, a 2.1% decrease year over year. Q4 Postpaid Net Additions: Fourth-quarter wireless postpaid phone net additions jumped to 449,000, a significant increase from the previous year.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Sign with VZ.\n\nOn January 23, 2024, Verizon Communications Inc (NYSE:VZ) released its 8-K filing, detailing the company's financial performance for the fourth quarter and full-year 2023. As a leading provider of technology and communications services, Verizon has shown resilience in its wireless segment, which accounts for the majority of its service revenue and operating income. The company serves a vast customer base with approximately 92 million postpaid and 22 million prepaid phone customers, bolstered by its nationwide network and the acquisition of Tracfone. Verizon Communications Inc (VZ) Reports Mixed 2023 Results with Strong Wireless Growth Amidst Revenue Decline\n\nFinancial Performance and Challenges\n\nVerizon's financial results for 2023 reflect a mix of achievements and challenges. The company's wireless service revenue grew by 3.2% for the full year, reaching $76.7 billion, driven by pricing actions and the adoption of higher premium plans. Fixed wireless net additions also saw a significant increase, indicating strong demand for Verizon's product offerings. However, the company faced a decline in total operating revenue, which decreased by 2.1% to $134.0 billion for the full year, attributed to lower wireless equipment revenue and a decrease in total postpaid upgrades.\n\nThe company's earnings per share (EPS) for the full year stood at $2.75, a sharp decline from $5.06 in 2022. Adjusted EPS, excluding special items, was $4.71, compared to $5.18 in the previous year. This decline in EPS was influenced by a pre-tax loss from special items amounting to approximately $7.8 billion, including a significant goodwill impairment charge related to the Business reporting unit.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite these challenges, Verizon's cash flow from operations increased slightly to $37.5 billion, and the company reported a robust free cash flow of $18.7 billion, up from $14.1 billion in 2022. These figures underscore the company's ability to generate cash and maintain financial flexibility.\n\nKey Financial Metrics\n\nVerizon's financial achievements in 2023, particularly in wireless customer growth and cash flow improvement, are critical for the company's long-term strategy in the competitive telecommunications industry. The increase in wireless service revenue and fixed wireless net additions demonstrates the company's strong position in the market and its ability to attract and retain customers. The improvement in free cash flow is also a positive indicator for investors, as it provides the company with the resources to invest in network improvements, pay down debt, and return value to shareholders.\n\nHowever, the decline in total operating revenue and EPS presents challenges that Verizon will need to address. The competitive landscape of the telecommunications industry requires continuous investment in technology and network infrastructure to meet customer demands and stay ahead of competitors. The decrease in operating revenue and the substantial goodwill impairment charge highlight the need for Verizon to reassess its business strategies, particularly within its Business reporting unit.\n\nOutlook and Guidance for 2024\n\nLooking ahead to 2024, Verizon expects total wireless service revenue growth of 2.0% to 3.5% and adjusted EBITDA growth of 1.0% to 3.0%. The company anticipates adjusted EPS to be in the range of $4.50 to $4.70 and plans for capital expenditures between $17.0 billion and $17.5 billion. The adjusted effective income tax rate is projected to be between 22.5% and 24.0%.\n\nVerizon's performance in 2023 and its outlook for 2024 will be of keen interest to value investors and potential members of GuruFocus.com, as they assess the company's financial health and future prospects. The company's ability to navigate the challenges ahead and capitalize on its strengths in the wireless market will be critical in determining its success in the coming year.\n\nExplore the complete 8-K earnings release (here) from Verizon Communications Inc for further details.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/verizon-communications-inc-vz-reports-182823453.html", "symbols": ["BAC.F", "BAC.XETRA", "VERZ34.SA", "VZ.MX", "VZ.US"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.998, "neg": 0.026, "neu": 0.811, "pos": 0.164}}, {"date": "2024-01-24T17:33:02+00:00", "title": "Why cable stocks look better than telecoms: Analyst", "content": "AT&T (T) reported mixed fourth-quarter results after Verizon's (VZ) strong print, which MoffettNathanson's Co-Founder and Senior Analyst Craig Moffett tells Yahoo Finance Live was expected as \"what you see is what you get with these companies.\" He says AT&T's ongoing challenge is lack of growth.\n\nMoffett sees AT&T's 5G network buildout \"largely\" complete, but questions if it can drive revenues yet, calling it \"a running in place type of investment and an expensive one at that.\" He's also skeptical of convergence opportunities from fiber investments that he says will only cover about 25% of the country, leaving most untouched.\n\nInstead, he calls cable operators \"more interesting,\" positioned to win if convergence accelerates versus phone companies with limited fiber reach.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Angel Smith.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nSEANA SMITH: All right, let's take a look at one of the trending tickers here this morning, and that is AT&T. Reporting results before the bell, missing on earnings, even as it added more customers than expected here. Now this comes as Verizon came out with its earnings on Tuesday, which came in strong.\n\nSo what's the play in the telecom space this year? We want to bring in Craig Moffett. He's MoffettNathanson's co-founder and senior analyst. All right, Craig let's talk about this. Let's start with AT&T, because we're looking at losses of shares just about 2%. There certainly were tidbits in this report that investors are taking issue with. But my question to you is, what do you think these results tell us just about the fundamentals of AT&T's business?\n\nCRAIG MOFFETT: Well, look, overall, it was a quarter that was more or less what you expected. The results in subscribers-- and you have to start, like any subscription business, with the subscriber counts. And the subscriber counts were pretty good.\n\nStory continues\n\nI think the challenge here is you look at this company, and it's really not growing. It hasn't grown faster than the rate of inflation in a decade. You've had a lot of tailwinds during that period for wireless overall. And you look forward, they're not guiding to any material earnings growth.\n\nI think that's why the market is reacting negatively this morning is the market had expected some material EPS growth. And you know, what you see is what you get with these companies. They're very slow growth companies. They pay a decent dividend. But the capital appreciation story hasn't worked in 30 years for the telcos.\n\nBRAD SMITH: You know, Craig, as the call had been taking place this morning, perhaps a lot of the focus may have not just been on the additions for subscribers, but also where the company is investing further here. Is there any of that investment, that CapEx that's going to be going out the door that you believe AT&T has to get right in order to hit its next inflection point for investors?\n\nCRAIG MOFFETT: Well, look, they have largely finished building out the 5G network, as have their peers. But the real question now is whether 5G will materialize as a real revenue driver. So far, it hasn't. It's been sort of a running in place type of investment, and an expensive one at that.\n\nOn the wireline side of the business, what I scratch my head over is the convergence strategy, right? They spoke a lot on their conference call about the power of convergence and the ability to offer a wired broadband solution and a wireless broadband solution. That's a lot of what's driving the capital investment that they're making in fiber.\n\nWell, that's fine, but their fiber network will eventually cover something like 25% of the United States. What do you do with the other 75% of the country? They talk about it as though they're advantaged, but I think a better way to characterize it is they are perhaps less disadvantaged than their peers.\n\nBut if convergence really happens, the cable operators are going to win the war, because cable operators can offer a converged solution everywhere, and the telephone companies that they compete with can't. And that's actually why I think, for me, particularly with expectations quite low for the cable operators. The cable operators are more interesting at this point than the phone companies are.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/video/why-cable-stocks-look-better-173302293.html", "symbols": ["0Q1S.LSE", "BAC.F", "BAC.XETRA", "SOBA.F", "SOBA.XETRA", "T.MX", "T.US", "TBB.US", "VERZ34.SA", "VZ.MX", "VZ.US"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.997, "neg": 0.035, "neu": 0.836, "pos": 0.129}}, {"date": "2024-01-24T17:32:13+00:00", "title": "Is T-Mobile A Buy With Q4 Earnings Report Due?", "content": "T-Mobile holds an edge in 5G wireless spectrum but will its market share gains vs. rivals continue?

Verizon\u2019s lasting dedication to those who have served has led to its being named a top 10 Military Friendly Company for six consecutive years, including three as the #1 Military Friendly Company in the United States.\n\n\u201cVerizon has a strong tradition of supporting the military community, and donations to organizations like the USO play a critical role in carrying this mission forward,\u201d said Kyle Malady, CEO of Verizon Business. \u201cAs the executive sponsor of Verizon VALOR, our employee resource group for the more than 8,000 veterans and 500 military spouses part of our workforce across the globe, I see firsthand how important the work of the USO is to those in uniform, and it is personally important to me that Verizon Business contributes.\u201d\n\n\"I would like to extend a heartfelt thank you to Verizon Business for their generous contribution to USO Europe, Middle East, and Africa,\u201d said USO EMEA Regional Vice President Grant McCormick. \u201cWith these funds, we can significantly enhance our programs for the people who serve. Together with Verizon Business, we are committed to having a positive impact on the quality of life for our service members and their families.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nAbout USO EMEA:\r\nU.S. forces serving in Europe play a critical role in deterring traditional military threats to our country and providing vital support to others deployed in operations in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and beyond. USO locations in Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom support service members and their families by helping them stay connected to loved ones and their communities back home, despite being stationed so far away from everything familiar.\n\nUSO personnel also directly support troops exercising with our allies in more remote European locations, such as Poland, Romania, Hungary, Lithuania and Slovakia. Additionally, local programs and community-building activities like gaming events, holiday celebrations, creative arts and food-focused events provide a much-needed break from the demanding and challenging environment of life on deployment.\n\nAbout USO Gaming & Rapid Response Gaming Kits:\r\nGaming provides a generationally relevant online and in-person activity that helps service members relax and unwind. It also enables them to connect and interact with their fellow service members, families, and friends, as well as the civilian community, which helps to diminish the military-civilian divide.\n\nUSO Gaming strives towards a comprehensive gaming program which encapsulates opportunities for all types of gamers from competitive to casual, tabletop to digital. Gaming promotes mental wellness, social interaction, and entertainment while also providing service members and their families increased resiliency, stress relief, communication opportunities, and enhanced military camaraderie.\n\nThe comprehensive USO Gaming program provides gaming capabilities, used both online and in-person, for service members and their families, in addition to public partnerships, such as invitationals, streaming, content creation and entertainment events. The program includes local, regional and national events, including numerous tournaments, leagues, community events and competitions.\n\nThe USO Gaming program has continued to expand through the construction of USO Gaming Centers and dedicated gaming spaces within existing USO centers across the globe, as well as featuring prominent gaming experts and military family programming. Service members deployed to the front lines remained entertained and connected through USO Gaming\u2019s Rapid Response Gaming Kits, which are portable, fully-contained gaming kits designed to support service members in the most austere locations around the world.\n\nVerizon Communications Inc.

Here's Why Investors Didn't Care.", "content": "How you think about Verizon Communications(NYSE: VZ) could depend on whether you see the proverbial glass of water as half-empty or half-full. For example, some will note that the telecom stock has lagged well behind the S&P 500 over the last 12 months. Others, however, will rightly point out that Verizon has trounced the market over the previous three- and six-month periods.\n\nThe difference in views could also surface with the company's fourth-quarter results, announced on Tuesday. Verizon just delivered plenty of bad news -- but here's why investors didn't care.\n\nBad news for Verizon in multiple areas\n\nYou won't have to look hard to find negatives with Verizon's Q4 results. Starting at the top of the income statement, the telecom giant's operating revenue slipped 0.3% lower year over year to $35.1 billion.\n\nThe main culprit for Verizon's top line was a decline in wireless equipment revenue. This resulted from postpaid upgrades falling by 17.9% from the prior-year period.\n\nThe issues for Verizon trickled down to its bottom line as well. The company posted a net loss in Q4 of $2.6 billion, or $0.64 per share, based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In the same quarter of 2022, Verizon delivered positive earnings of $6.7 billion, or $1.56 per share. Verizon Q4 2023 Income Statement Sankey Chart.\n\nA pretax loss from special items of around $7.8 billion weighed heavily on Verizon's Q4 results. This loss included a $5.8 billion goodwill impairment and a $992 million mark-to-market adjustment for the company's pension and other post-employment benefits liabilities.\n\nEven on an adjusted basis, though, Verizon's earnings still declined year over year. The company reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.08 in Q4, down from $1.19 in the prior year period.\n\nThe silver linings that investors applauded\n\nDespite all of this bad news, Verizon's share price jumped close to 6% on Tuesday following the Q4 update. Why? Investors applauded several silver linings in the company's generally gloomy earnings results.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe big story was that Verizon's wireless business delivered impressive growth. Total wireless postpaid phone net additions more than doubled year over year to 449,000. Consumer postpaid phone gross additions jumped 17% year over year, the company's best quarterly performance since 2020.\n\nVerizon's broadband business continued to pick up momentum as well. Total broadband net additions in Q4 came in at 413,000. This marked the fifth consecutive quarter Verizon has reported more than 400,000 broadband net additions.\n\nFor full-year 2023, Verizon generated free cash flow of $18.7 billion. This total is up from $14.1 billion in 2022.\n\nInvestors also found something to like in Verizon's guidance for 2024. The company projects total wireless service revenue will grow between 2% and 3.5%, reversing last year's decline.\n\nIs Verizon stock a smart pick to buy now?\n\nInvestors seeking strong growth probably aren't going to view Verizon as an attractive stock to buy. That's nothing new. However, I think that there's a much different story for income investors.\n\nVerizon's dividend yield currently stands at nearly 6.4%. The company has increased its dividend for 17 consecutive years. I expect that shareholder-friendly streak to continue.\n\nVerizon's dividend payout ratio is a healthy 52.8%. Rising free cash flow puts the telecom leader in an even stronger position to boost its dividend in the future.\n\nIncome investors should see Verizon as a glass of water that's more than half-full, in my opinion. If they have some cash to put to work, they might want to take a sip of this solid dividend stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Verizon Communications right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Verizon Communications, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Verizon Communications wasn't one of them.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. I'm Brady Connor, and I'm joined by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Hans Vestberg; as well as our Chief Financial Officer, Tony Skiadas. \r\nBefore we begin, I'd like to draw your attention to our safe harbor statement, which can be found on Slide 2 of the presentation.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. I hope you all had a great start of 2024. I'm pleased to report that Verizon closed out the year with a strong fourth quarter, finishing off a year of solid operation and financial performance. For us, 2023 was a year of continuous improvement and important actions across the business. We made significant changes to how we operate and to our team, and those changes paid off. \r\nWe stabilized our core business and positioned the company for renewed growth and profitability. We built strong momentum quarter after quarter, culminating in a very good holiday season. And finally, we met the guidance that we provided to you in each of our key performance indicators. \r\nEntering 2024, Verizon stands ready to further unlock our performance potential at an accelerating rate. We now have all the assets, the best team in the business and a focus on continued operational excellence to deliver even better results going forward. \r\nLet me share some full year highlights with you. Wireless service revenue for 2023 was $76.7 billion, a 3.2% year-over-year increase. We delivered outstanding volumes during a healthy fourth quarter where our customers clearly embraced our offerings. Full year adjusted EBITDA was $47.8 billion, contributing to a very strong free cash flow of $18.7 billion, reflecting our disciplined and strategic approach to profitable growth. \r\nAs a result of our financial strength, we raised our dividend for the 17th year in a row with a healthy free cash flow dividend payout ratio of approximately 59%. We also reduced our year-over-year leverage while continuing to bring CapEx back towards business as usual levels. This aligns with the capital allocation priorities we have shared in recent years. \r\nThese results provide a solid foundation with Verizon's journey and future success. And I'm pleased that we put the leadership and team in place last year that will serve Verizon stakeholders well in both the short and long term. We, as a team, have focused on capturing the market opportunity, and I'm proud of our progress in 2023. \r\nJust two weeks ago, Leslie Berland joined Verizon as our Chief Marketing Officer. I'm excited to bring her on board and have a great confidence in her ability to continue shaping Verizon's premium brand perception and story. \r\nWe started 2023 determined to differentiate ourselves by investing even more in profitable growth while transforming Verizon to make the company more efficient and effective. Seeing the continued strength of the U.S. consumer, busy holiday store traffic and rising demand for mobility, broadband and private networks, we also took actions to fuel growth during the fourth quarter, and it showed in our results. \r\nA standout milestone in 2023 was our launch of myPlan, which was designed from extensive customer research to be the most flexible plan available to U.S. consumers from any wireless company. myPlan has been a great success that has seen stellar adoption. Introduced in May, we already have 13.1 million myPlan subscribers. \r\nAnd these customers are choosing premium packages and our unique perks driving ARPA. Other changes we made in 2023 include establishing a regional distribution model, tailing our approach to every market, revamping sales composition to support productivity and introducing new price plans and promotions in Consumer and Business. \r\nVerizon Business also partnered with HCLTech to be more efficient to deliver post-sale implementation and customer support from managed network services, enhancing our customer service while saving Verizon money. These actions paired with all of our assets sets us up very well for 2024. We are now working from an effective model, and this is just a start. Overall, the wireless industry is strong as we head into 2024, and we are confident in our strategy. We have great offerings with optionality to meet the needs of customers of any budget on the best network in the country. \r\nNow let me share a bit more how each of our service performed in the fourth quarter. Starting with Mobility. We had 449,000 postpaid phone net adds, driven by improving net adds in Consumer and a continued sustainable performance in Verizon Business. Our disciplined and segmented market approach is working with customers and creating great economics for our shareholders. \r\nIn Consumer, you can see the pattern of continuous improvement from the start of the year. In the fourth quarter, we delivered our best postpaid phone gross adds performance since 2019 and our best net adds in two years. We added 318,000 postpaid phone customers in the fourth quarter, and our gross adds were up almost 17% year-over-year. It is clear that we have momentum in Consumer as we move into 2024, and we'll continue to work to get our fair share of new business. \r\nOur customer-centric offers are resonating in the market, and we're just getting started. By leveraging Verizon's large subscriber base and key partnership, we can deliver exclusive discount offers like Netflix and Max for just $10 a month, underscoring our industry leadership in value-driven content offerings. With our vast network coverage and the largest base of loyal customers, we're uniquely positioned to provide targeted high-value deals that deepen relationships across connected devices, streaming and more. \r\nWithin the value business, which includes our prepaid offerings like TracFone, Visible and Total by Verizon, we still have work do, but are making progress. \r\nMoving to Verizon Business. The team continued to deliver on Mobility with total postpaid phone net adds of 131,000 for the fourth quarter 2023, marking our tenth consecutive quarter of postpaid phone net adds above 125,000. For the full year, business added 562,000 phone net adds, an outstanding result. Our Business customers are prioritizing mobility and value the optionality we offer with highly tailored plans on the best network in the country. \r\nNow let's turn to Broadband. For the year, we had more than 1.7 million Broadband net adds with more than 1.5 million net adds from fixed wireless access and 248,000 net adds from Fios, a nice increase over 2022. \r\nOn fixed wireless access, we're consistently adding more than 350,000 subscribers per quarter, which is part of our plan for steady, sustainable growth that exceeds what we expected at launch. Just three years of the launch, we serve more than 3 million fixed wireless access customers, well ahead of our stated goal of 4 million to 5 million subscribers by the end of 2025. With fixed wireless access, we're expanding into new markets and proving the value of Verizon's connectivity. \r\nCustomers are finding strong reliability and speed in fixed wireless access, and that shows in our results, including a very strong Net Promoter Score. For a product that still is in the beginning, the pace of adoption has the team super excited. We expect this will be a long-term source of recurring revenue for Verizon, and we're entering this year with a strong base for continued growth. \r\nTurning to the private networks and our 5G business solutions. We continue to see interest from large enterprises running complex logistics and operations like ports, automotive and heavy industries. In November, Norfolk International Terminal contracted us to build a second private 5G network for them. All the already one of our partners in smart car development has contracted us to build a private network for their automotive tech testing environment. And Nucor, one of the country's largest steel companies, has us building private networks for three of its sites with more to come over the next year. \r\nStrategically, we are building a new source of revenue expansion where we are the clear leader. Last year, we also expanded existing 5G private network partnerships with NFL to bring new spectator and retail experience to fans everywhere. When we build relationships with these large enterprises, and they see what our network can do for them, there is always potential for more business. And our network is just getting better and better every day. \r\nWith full access to our spectrum as of the end of third quarter last year, our mission is to optimize experience in every market and expand into suburban and rural markets, where we know our Consumer and Business customers are eager to take up our offerings. We have been expanding and improving our network in key markets through 2023 and into this year. I have said it before, and I will say it again, our network is the foundation of how we offer the best value and premium experience to our customers. And we are now seeing our investment in C-Band paying off in terms of customer experience and loyalty. \r\nWhere we have C-Band, we see higher gross adds, lower churn and more step-ups to premium services. We also see increased uptake of customers taking both mobility and broadband services. Meanwhile, millimeter wave, which we have now deployed in many urban areas and all 30 NFL stadiums, sets Verizon apart with an outstanding performance at high-density areas and public event spaces. And for the 32nd consecutive time, Verizon was the most awarded company in the country for wireless network quality with the first place rankings in each of J.D. Power's 6 regions. We are the network that America relies on, and we take that commitment very seriously. \r\nLooking ahead, our priority for 2024 are crystal clear. We remain laser-focused on growing wireless service revenue and expanding our adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow to allow for a meaningful debt reduction in the year ahead. This is what our whole team is working towards and what you, our shareholders and our Board want us to focus on. \r\nTony will have more details for you, but we anticipate strong wireless service revenue growth of 2% to 3.5% in 2024, which reflects our ability to sustain the top line of our business as we continue to pursue the right balance or profitability and customer growth. Our adjusted EBITDA profile will continue to improve as we become even more efficient with growth, cost saving measures and our disciplined promotional spending. Our capital allocation priorities remain consistent. And as we lower our capital intensity from the C-Band build-out and our new business structure, we expect to see continued strong free cash flow generation going forward. That will enable our Board to continue to raise our dividend and also enable us to bring down leverage. \r\nNow Tony will discuss the quarter as well as our operations and guidance in more detail.\n\nAnthony T. Skiadas\n\nThanks, Hans, and good morning. Executing on our plan, we finished the year strong and delivered on our financial guidance. We exited the year with good momentum and remain committed to our three priorities of growing wireless service revenue, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. \r\nIn 2023, we set out to improve our operational performance while sustaining financial discipline. Our fourth quarter and full year results confirm that our strategy is working and that we can deliver strong financials and improve key operating metrics. Consumer postpaid phone net adds totaled 318,000 for the quarter, a substantial improvement of 369,000 sequentially and 277,000 compared to the prior year. Our Consumer postpaid phone churn of 0.88% represents a stable result even after we implemented over $1 billion of annualized pricing actions in 2023. While we do not provide specific guidance on volumes, we wanted to share a couple of items as we look into 2024. \r\nIn the first quarter, we are taking additional targeted pricing actions that we expect will result in incremental pressure on Consumer postpaid phone churn in the period. However, we expect to deliver positive Consumer postpaid phone net adds in full year 2024 as we execute on our strategy of growing our subscriber base while being financially disciplined. \r\nPostpaid phone gross adds in the quarter were up nearly 17% year-over-year. This represents our best quarterly consumer gross add performance in four years. Our attractive myPlan offers combined with our segmented approach to the market, regional sales structure and disciplined promotional strategy continued to deliver strong results. Additionally, postpaid upgrades remained lower as compared to the prior year. The Consumer postpaid upgrade rate was 4.4% in the fourth quarter, down 120 basis points year-over-year as a result of approximately 19% fewer upgrades. \r\nAs Hans said, we continue to see better performance in markets where we have deployed C-Band. In our first 76 C-Band markets, fourth quarter Consumer postpaid phone gross add growth was 8 percentage points better than in non-C-Band markets. \r\nAdditionally, Consumer postpaid phone churn and C-Band markets was 4 basis points better than in non-C-Band markets. The strong momentum in the quarter, combined with the continued deployment of our C-Band network positions us well in 2024. The quality of the business we are writing in Consumer remains high as myPlan continues to drive premium plan adoption. The premium take rate in C-Band markets for the quarter was more than 10 percentage points higher than in non-C-Band markets. Consumer ARPA of $134.10 represents an increase of 4.7% year-over-year. This was driven by new customer additions, premium plan adoption and fixed wireless subscriber growth. We expect continued and healthy organic ARPA growth in 2024. \r\nOur prepaid results remained challenged in the fourth quarter. This is in part to seasonally weaker national retail sales volumes, which is the primary sales channel for our TracFone brands. We also continue to see pricing pressures from low-end postpaid offerings. Prepaid net losses for the quarter were 289,000. During the quarter, we saw continued strong growth within the Visible and Total by Verizon brands, which we will continue to scale. The team is also focused on our partnerships to improve the performance of the Straight Talk brand. We believe we're taking the right steps to better position our offerings in the market and expect to see some stabilization in 2024. \r\nVerizon Business delivered another strong quarter with 131,000 phone net adds which, as Hans mentioned, is our tenth consecutive quarter above 125,000. The Business Markets Group had its best phone net add performance in the last two years, demonstrating how our value proposition is resonating with small and medium businesses. Similar to Consumer, we are taking pricing actions in the first quarter in Business that could result in elevated phone churn in the period. However, we are confident that we will continue to deliver strong Business volumes in 2024. \r\nMoving on to broadband. We delivered 413,000 net additions in the quarter, continuing the pace of over 400,000 broadband net adds for the fifth consecutive quarter. We see strong demand for both our fiber and fixed wireless offerings, and we continue to see positive responses from customers regarding the quality and reliability of our services. In fixed wireless, we delivered 375,000 net adds for the quarter, growing the base to over 3 million subscribers. \r\nWe launched C-Band in early 2022 and our fixed wireless success in the last two years reflects the strong demand for high-quality broadband and the strength and reliability of our product. Notably, in the fourth quarter, over 80% of our consumer fixed wireless gross adds came from C-Band markets. The growth trajectory for fixed wireless continues to be robust, and we are ahead of schedule to achieve our 4 million to 5 million subscriber goal by year-end 2025. Fios Internet net adds were 55,000, down 4,000 year-over-year. We are pleased with the success of Fios with strong gross adds and retention, reflecting the quality and overall value of the product. We expect broadband subscriber momentum to extend into 2024 as we continue deployment of our C-Band spectrum, further expand our Fios footprint and bring new products and offers to the market. \r\nLet's now look at our financials. Consolidated revenue for the fourth quarter was $35.1 billion, down 0.3% year-over-year. This change can be attributed to the wireless equipment revenue, which was approximately 2% lower than the prior year as total postpaid upgrades declined by approximately 18%. Total wireless service revenue was $19.4 billion, up 3.2% year-over-year. Strong revenue benefited from targeted pricing actions, more customers selecting premium unlimited plans and growth in fixed wireless access. This was partially offset by pressure from prepaid, which reduced total wireless service revenue growth by approximately 70 basis points year-over-year as well as promo amortization. \r\nConsolidated adjusted EBIT in the quarter was $11.7 billion, a decrease of 0.6% compared to the prior year. Higher wireless service revenue and the benefits of lower upgrades were more than offset by higher marketing and bad debt expense and ongoing declines in business wireline revenue. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 33.2% was relatively flat year-over-year. In 2023, we implemented transformations within our Consumer customer care group as well as Business managed services. We are pleased with what we have achieved this year, and our cost-saving measures are meeting our expectations. We expect further progress on our cost efficiency program in 2024. Adjusted EPS was $1.08 in the quarter, resulting in full year adjusted EPS of $4.71. \r\nTurning to our cash flow summary. Cash flow from operating activities for the fourth quarter was $8.7 billion, bringing the total for 2023 to $37.5 billion. This marks the year-over-year improvement of over $300 million, primarily due to working capital improvements. CapEx for the quarter came in at $4.6 billion compared to $7.3 billion in the prior year. The full year CapEx totaled $18.8 billion, which represents a more than $4 billion reduction in capital spending from 2022 as we come down from our peak C-Band spending level. \r\nFree cash flow for the fourth quarter was $4.1 billion, bringing our year-to-date total to $18.7 billion, a $4.7 billion increase over the prior year, driven by operational improvements and the lower CapEx spending that we previously noted. We are pleased to have delivered on our guidance of more than $18 billion of free cash flow for the full year, which reflects our balanced and strategic approach to delivering profitable growth. \r\nNet unsecured debt at the end of the quarter was $126.4 billion, a $1.6 billion improvement year-over-year. Net unsecured debt increased sequentially primarily due to settling the $3.7 billion in incentive payments to satellite operators for our remaining C-Band spectrum. Our net unsecured debt consolidated adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.6x as of the end of the fourth quarter, in line with the prior two quarters. \r\nWe expect deleveraging of the balance sheet to accelerate in 2024 as CapEx comes down to BAU levels, and we continue to generate strong cash flow. Additionally, we continue to benefit from our approach to managing long-term debt and have only $3.6 billion of unsecured debt maturing in 2024. Overall, I'm pleased with our momentum exiting the year and our performance in 2023, delivering an improved operational profile while also meeting our financial guidance. \r\nNow I want to take a few moments to look ahead and walk through our 2024 guidance. Our 2024 guidance demonstrates our expectations for accelerating wireless service revenue growth. As a reminder, the reported 2023 wireless service revenue growth of 3.2% included approximately 190 basis points of benefit from a reallocation of other revenues. Excluding this reallocation, the 2023 wireless service revenue growth was 1.3%. \r\nFor 2024, we expect total wireless service revenue to grow between 2% and 3.5%. This will be driven by anticipated positive postpaid phone additions to both Consumer and Business, continued fixed wireless access subscriber growth, further adoption of premium unlimited plans, growth in products and services and pricing action benefits. We expect consolidated adjusted EBITDA to grow by 1% to 3% versus the prior year. \r\nThis outlook reflects expected higher wireless service revenue and the impact of our cost transformation initiatives, partially offset by continued pressure in Business wireline revenues and increased wireless network operating expenses. Full year adjusted earnings per share is expected to be $4.50 to $4.70. As noted, we expect adjusted EBITDA to grow in 2024, offset by certain below-the-line impacts. \r\nSpecifically, higher interest expense is expected to impact adjusted EPS by $0.16 to $0.19, over 75% of which is driven by the continued reduction in capitalized interest related to the C-Band licenses being placed into service. In addition, EPS is expected to be impacted by approximately $0.07 to $0.09, of higher pension and OPEB expense, primarily due to the expiration of certain credits. This impact will flow through the other income and expense line on our income statement. We expect depreciation and amortization to be relatively flat in 2024 compared to 2023. \r\nOur adjusted effective income tax rate is expected to be in the range of 22.5% to 24% based on current legislation. As discussed in prior quarters, capital spending for the full year is expected to be between $17 billion and $17.5 billion, down from $18.8 billion in 2023. While we are not providing guidance on 2024 free cash flow, we wanted to provide some additional color to aid with your analysis. \r\nTailwinds to free cash flow will come from our adjusted EBITDA growth outlook as well as the expected $1.5 billion reduction in CapEx in 2024 based on the midpoint of our guided CapEx range. Offsets will be higher interest expense and higher cash taxes. As a reminder, the majority of the higher interest expense relates to reductions in capitalized interest. Such interest was recognized in cash flow from investing prior to placing the C-Band spectrum into service. \r\nThe higher cash taxes are primarily related to the continued phaseout of bonus depreciation in 2024 based on current legislation. Overall, we expect a strong free cash flow profile that will support our capital allocation priorities and position us for meaningful unsecured debt reduction in 2024, which we expect to come in the latter half of the year. \r\nWith that, I will now turn the call back over to Hans for his closing thoughts.\n\nHans E. Vestberg\n\nThank you, Tony. As you've heard today, we are confident and well positioned to deliver a solid 2024. Thanks to our best-in-class network, which is only getting better, we offer the mobile and broadband services that customers value and need the most. Our industry is critical to the next wave of innovation, and Verizon is ready to capitalize on the opportunity of the AI economy to bring this technology to live for all our stakeholders. \r\nAs I said in the beginning, we have the right team in place to execute the next chapter in Verizon's history. I'm proud of the work our team accomplished in 2023 and are excited what we will deliver in 2024. Our results in C-Band market speaks for themselves and support our investment decisions, and we're going to lean in further as we expand into suburban and rural markets while maintaining the financial discipline you come to expect from us. We will continue to stay very close to our customers to understand their needs and preferences so that we can offer the right promotions at the right times in the right markets. \r\nWe have the right people, the right assets and the right strategy. Our focus for 2024 is on execution. It's a winning combination, and we are very confident heading into this year. \r\nFinally, I want to remind you that we are hosting an investor event on February 5 and encourage everyone to tune in to the webcast. Given the financial update today, next month will be more of an operational and strategic update on the company. \r\nNow Brady, we are ready to take questions.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nThanks, Hans. Brad, we're ready for the first question.\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nOperator\n\nWe will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) The first question will come from John Hodulik of UBS.\n\nJohn Christopher Hodulik\n\nI'd love to drill down on a couple of things. First, the sub trends, 17% growth is some real momentum. I know, Hans, you talked about a number of sort of potential drivers. But if there's anything you could sort of be specific and sort of talk about what drove that in the quarter? And is that likely to continue, also the account growth, is that likely to continue? And then you talked about some churn on the price increase. Anything you could say about sort of the net add momentum as we look into '24? That's first. \r\nAnd maybe for Tony, nice service revenue growth. Any additional info you can give us to sort of unpack that in terms of the price increase impact versus last year and what you're seeing in terms of Tier, that would be great.\n\nHans E. Vestberg\n\nJohn, thank you for the question. So let me start about the subs then. On the Business side, tenth quarter in a row, more than 125,000, Kyle and the team is doing a great job where our network is performing so well. So our customers just continue to buy in with us, not only that. Our offerings in our go-to-market is as strong as ever. So we feel really good about what Kyle and the team is doing. \r\nOn the Consumer side, yes, we had a good fourth quarter. But you have seen also all through the year that we have sequentially improved all the time. Everything started where -- we started with a new offering myPlan, which resonates with the market, very much consumer insights in it. Then on top of that, Sampath has done a lot of changes in our structure all the way from the go-to-market, the incentives in our stores and our decentralization of it. \r\nSo it hangs together all the way. So I think the most important, we have the right offerings in the market, and that has really resonated on the Consumer side. So I'm really happy with the team. We will continue to execute on the plan we have, and we have started.\n\nAnthony T. Skiadas\n\nJohn, it's Tony. So just to add on to what Hans mentioned. We did really well in Tier 1 markets. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, about 8 percentage points better and we were also net add positive in both Tier 2 and Tier 3 markets as well. We improved our competitive positioning against all providers. We continue to build out C-Band, as we said earlier in suburban and rural markets, and we see further opportunity there. And as Hans mentioned, we had strong momentum in the VBG side as well, on both mobility and FWA, so good results. \r\nAnd then on your question on service revenue. So we feel really good about the shape of service revenue in 2024. The guidance that we gave of 2% to 3.5% reflects accelerated growth, and we talked about the jump-off point of 1.3% in the prepared remarks. The midpoint of our guidance range implies over $2 billion of service revenue growth. If we think about the assumptions in the guide in terms of tailwinds, as you know, we've executed a number of pricing actions, both in the back half of 2023 that do carry into 2024 as well as in recent weeks, we've taken further pricing actions in both Consumer and Business that provide a tailwind. \r\nWe also have an improving volume profile in our Consumer business. As we said in the prepared remarks, we expect to have positive phone net adds in consumer in 2024 and stable business volumes as well. And then the third tailwind I'd point to is an increasing contribution from fixed wireless access. We have really good momentum and over 3 million subs in the base. \r\nIn terms of headwinds, prepaid, has been a drag on service revenue both in the fourth quarter and the full year was about $142 million in the fourth quarter, and we expect the prepaid headwinds to continue into 2024 as we stabilize that business. And then on promo amortization, that continues to be a headwind with the increase in 2024, similar to the increase we experienced in 2023. But when you put that all together, we like the trajectory of service revenue.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley.\n\nSimon William Flannery\n\nJust following up there on the fixed wireless. Could you just give us a little bit of color around how the churn is performing? What are you seeing in terms of those cohorts that have had this service for some time and any comments on sort of capacity and so forth. \r\nAnd also, are you seeing emerging seasonality in this product driven by strong back-to-school in Q3 and then maybe a little bit softer in Q4. And then anything you can -- color you can provide on your exposure to ACP and how that may affect you and your latest thoughts on the BEAD program.\n\nHans E. Vestberg\n\nOkay. Thank you. On the fixed wireless access, I think the product is maturing. We're now past 3 million subs, both on the Business side and Consumer together. Clearly, the rollout and the product is unique. It has -- it resonates so good in the market, simplicity of the product and installing it, which was the -- which was our idea. And even if we took out the discount that we had in the third quarter, we haven't seen any slowdown. The product is resonating so well. \r\nWe are constantly improving it. The NPS is really high on the product. And as I said so many times before, for us, is to keep the same volume right now because that -- we are demanding our capacity, or our capital in the best way. It's the most efficient way. So we will continue to be in these levels, and we think they are very important. \r\nAnd hoping that, of course, that our consumers using fixed wireless access that, they are using the network as anybody else. And as I said before, we have dimensioned the network to handle it, so that's not the challenge. And the most important for us is that we have fiberized all our network, and so we can transport all the data. The guys are doing a great job on fixed wireless access across the board.\n\nAnthony T. Skiadas\n\nYes. And then just one additional point there. So the longer-dated churn, Simon, is very strong, and we're very pleased with the progress thus far. \r\nOn your other question on ACP, just maybe a few points to make here. The guidance assumes that the ACP funding remains intact. In the event the funding goes away, we have plans to address it, and we'll see what happens there. The majority of the exposure on ACP is in our prepaid business. We have about 1.2 million prepaid subs that benefit from the ACP program, and that's less than 10% of our prepaid base. On the postpaid side, we have minimal exposure to ACP, both Fios and postpaid wireless. And the margin exposure from ACP is very, very small.\n\nHans E. Vestberg\n\nAnd on the BEAD program, we will participate when that comes out in the market where we see we can compete and where we see good return on investment. We have already won a couple in the early stages, but we expect that this will roll out over years to come. And -- but again, we will see that we participate when it makes sense for us, usually -- or not usually, always with financial discipline.\n\nSimon William Flannery\n\nGreat. And just one follow-up on the fiber build, is that again about 500,000 homes passed this year?\n\nAnthony T. Skiadas\n\nYes, Simon, it will be a little bit over 400,000 next year.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan.\n\nPhilip A. Cusick\n\nI think you said you expect postpaid phone positive for the year. What's the durability of Consumer growth? Could that also be positive for 2024? And remind us the impact that price increases tend to have on churn over the last couple of years. \r\nAnd then second, maybe you could just dig into where your gross adds are coming from, the improvements as you're doing better there. Churn has sort of been in line, but gross add is doing a lot better. If you could dig into that. Is there any significant shift in where customers are coming from, maybe from myPlan?\n\nHans E. Vestberg\n\nI can just start by saying but I'm going to hand it over to Tony. I think you're spot on. On myPlan, and I said it in my opening remarks, stellar performance so far on myPlan. But it's not only that the plan is good, it's both flexible, you have cost control and our customers get value of it. \r\nAnd I think that goes back to the -- what I talked about for years, disciplined approach, but also very segmented. And that's what's happening right now, and we can see that we allocate money to the right product to the right customer in the right market. So there's a lot of that. But Tony will give you a little bit of rundown on the numbers.\n\nAnthony T. Skiadas\n\nSure. So just, Phil, on the churn. I mean, obviously, we'll see a little bit of an uptick from the pricing changes we made in both Consumer and in Business. And those changes were announced in the last few weeks. And then as Hans mentioned, we really had good performance in Consumer. You saw the gross add number at 17% and 10% for the full year, and that's despite being in a much lower upgrade environment as well, so we feel really good. \r\nLike I said earlier, the Tier 1 markets were very strong, and we see further opportunity as we build out C-Band, the churn profile is much better. The ARPA is much better. So we're very comfortable with what we're seeing so far with C-Band and the performance.\n\nPhilip A. Cusick\n\nAnd in terms of the durability of postpaid and growth there?\n\nAnthony T. Skiadas\n\nYes. Look, we said we're going to be postpaid phone positive in Consumer in 2024, and we'll also continue to see strong momentum in Business as well. We did 562,000 net adds this year. And Kyle and the team did a great job, and we expect continued solid growth from the Business side as well.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi.\n\nMichael Ian Rollins\n\nJust one more on wireless pricing. Can you provide some additional context on how you're seeing the competitive landscape evolve with respect to pricing? And how Verizon is trying to balance the volume versus price equation as you look out from the recent pricing actions that you've taken? \r\nAnd then second, can you provide an update on how much the cost-cutting program yielded in '23 and how much you can capture it in '24 relative to the previously articulated target?\n\nHans E. Vestberg\n\nThanks, Mike. I think when it comes to our pricing and our promotions, I think we look more about we are the leader in the market. We look at the different segments we have to see that we have the right offerings for our right customer with the right value. That's the focus we have had for, I would say, the last two years, very much focused on our customer base and the consumers and the customers we can attract the Verizon. \r\nAnd so far, that disciplined approach we have, you saw the fourth quarter, for example, we invested in a little bit more because we have really good momentum. So sometimes, we're going to invest more, but it's always going to be with a return on investment in mind to see that we're doing the right for all our stakeholders. So that's the focus we have on the pricing we have, both on broadband and on wireless. \r\nOn the cost program, '23 was a big year for us. You probably are following all our press releases, but we did a lot in customer care. We did a lot with managed services without sourcing the HCL, we implemented some really large IT systems and application that's going to be a fantastic platform. We continue to deploy our offshore centers and being even stronger and using that as a platform on the basis that we created Verizon Global Services, the 1st of January '23. So I'm really pleased with the platforms, and that means we're on track for the savings we talked about, going into '24. It's more about the same. Tony?\n\nAnthony T. Skiadas\n\nSure. So just to add a couple of things here. So on 2023, we delivered about $300 million to $400 million in savings. And as Hans mentioned, we expect the program to ramp in 2024, and the savings are contemplated in the guide. Portion will hit the bottom line while also giving us the flexibility to invest in the business. And I think you saw that in the fourth quarter and the results speak for themselves. \r\nWe're not going to give specific cost targets, but what -- in addition to what Hans mentioned, we have work going on in IT platform transformation, in real estate and fleet optimization and we're also opening up shared service center in Ireland. So we feel really good about the cost actions that are driving the EBITDA improvements that you see in the guidance for this year.\n\nMichael Ian Rollins\n\nAnd just one other. Where are you in the process of restructuring of the Business wireline operations? And how close are you to an inflection where that segment can stabilize financially or potentially, eventually grow at some point?\n\nHans E. Vestberg\n\nThank you, Mike. No, that's a big focus for us. We have the secular decline, and we've had that for quite a while. So there's nothing new and nothing new to that story. But our cost efficiency is, of course, happening very, very quickly. And the team is doing a great job. Not only that, we also see that we have the right pricing for our customers and also seeing where we don't have great contract we have decided to walk away from them. \r\nSo very much tackling, blocking and tackling to see that we'll continue to improve. And of course, our target is to get that to sort of being neutral to our P&L over time. And that is one of the important pieces for getting the 25% of the Verizon Business Group in EBITDA, but not only that, of course, we're offsetting that by growing our wireless business and our broadband business. \r\nSo typical management of a product portfolio, and I would say Kyle and the team is doing a great job with the full support from Tony and me.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Frank Louthan of Raymond James.\n\nFrank Garrett Louthan\n\nSo you've made a lot of changes in the last year to kind of retail marketing to correct some of the past periods. You now got a new CMO. What can we expect her to be doing differently? Should we see this as another reset or change of direction? How should we think about that adjustment?\n\nHans E. Vestberg\n\nYou're right. Last year, we did a lot of changes. But looking at the result, I think many of the changes was absolutely right, all the way from our structural changes to go to market, the products. And also, we did quite a lot of management changes, getting the -- many of the executive new positions, including the recruiting a new CMO, Leslie Berland. We are excited to have her on. \r\nI think where we are with our brand and with our offerings, we're in a great place. But you cannot see still here, and that's why we recruited Leslie. Leslie will work with the full team to see how we continue to refine the leadership in the brand because we are the number one brand in the market, we're just going to refine that. But we're not going to sit still. So I think Leslie has been over two weeks. So I see a lot of great initiatives and ideas, and we will work together with her, to make this company even better.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America.\n\nDavid William Barden\n\nA couple, if I could. Just the first, you went out of your way to highlight how well fixed wireless access is doing in the C-Band markets. These are kind of the main markets, probably the densest markets. Obviously, we're going to see the C-Band deployment expand both in terms of spectrum density and in terms of geography. 350 has been kind of the baseline expectation for fixed wireless access adds in the current C-Band deployment. Would you be willing to put a stake in the ground? Where could that go? Could that double by the time we get the full C-Band deployment out there by the end of next year? That's the first question. \r\nAnd I guess the second question. Tony, you gave us the kind of moving parts, the EBITDA growth 2%. That's about $0.75 billion after tax. Interest expense at $0.175, that's about $3 billion -- $0.75 billion after tax, $1.5 billion CapEx savings. So the big moving part that none of us really know is the cash tax and how that might impact free cash flow, whether free cash flow could be up a little bit, down a little bit. Could you be more transparent around that moving part?\n\nHans E. Vestberg\n\nThank you, David. When it comes to fixed wireless access, yes, when we got the C-Band, the initial chunk of spectrum got was in urban places. Now since the end of the third quarter, we got the suburban and rural areas. But we continue at the end of the year to strengthen our urban area. So now we're sort of deploying much more in the suburban and rural. That creates a new opportunity for us, both from our strength in wireless in many of those markets together with our fixed wireless access. \r\nBut I said it many times before, for us, it's very important to have a certain volume and a certain cadence because we can optimize our resources, our capital, et cetera. So Tony and I feel really good about being around 400,000 net adds for broadband in total, including Fios. \r\nThat has sort of been a mantra, that can be, of course, coming up and down a little bit, but it's not like we are forcing a lot of capital and resources in the quarter and then doing less, that's not efficient in a company like ours. We are very financially disciplined, as you know. And that's best for our customers and for our stakeholders, like shareholders. So that's what you're going to expect from us.\n\nAnthony T. Skiadas\n\nAnd Dave, just on your -- question on cash taxes. So we said we're going to be pressured by the phaseout of bonus. We did see a tax benefit in 2023 from the spectrum clearing payments. And if you think about the headwind, we'd see it at about $2 billion right now, and we'll have to see how things play out with what the proposed legislation is.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson.\n\nCraig Eder Moffett\n\nI wonder if you could talk about your market growth expectations for postpaid coming into the year. I know you're the first one to report. So we haven't seen the results from anyone else yet. But what's your sense of what we can expect in terms of total postpaid and maybe total phone growth for 2024 market-wide?\n\nHans E. Vestberg\n\nThank you, Craig. If I think about this year, I mean, first of all, mobility in broadband is two of the most important infrastructure in the country. And I don't think it's any one company, person or organization can live without those services. We are the number one in basically everything we're doing. \r\nI think it's a healthy industry. It's an important product we have, then it can come up and down. So I cannot give you a percentage of what's going to happen. I think our offering is great. I think the product is so important, both mobility and broadband for all parts of our society. I wouldn't like to be in any other business, and it's sort of so important for our society that mobility and broadband is working.\n\nCraig Eder Moffett\n\nAnd can I just maybe drill down a little bit though? I mean the growth numbers we've seen have been as high as 6 million plus, is that a feasible growth rate? Population growth, including immigration is more like 3 million. Is your sense as you go into -- your own expectations for the year, that we'll see some deceleration? Or is your sense that there's still something going on that's keeping growth so far in excess of population growth?\n\nHans E. Vestberg\n\nI think that we're going to -- whatever number is going to be, we're going to get our fair share of it and that's what we are aiming for. But you're right, of course, immigration is lower. So the pool is smaller, but we've also seen a really good uptake between value segment to postpaid. So there's a lot of factors coming in. \r\nAnd then, of course, what we have done when we think about offerings, we have myPlan, we're adding the perks for example, in Netflix and Max. We are expanding also ARPA because we have such a great offering to our customers. So this is a new time. But again, the product is so important for the market and for each and every one of us. So I feel really good about coming into this year, what we have done and where we go, and let's see where we end up.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Kannan Venkateshwar from Barclays.\n\nKannan Venkateshwar\n\nSo maybe a couple. I guess, firstly, on the fiber side, Hans, as you think about the base of fixed wireless subscribers. By next year, you'll have a pretty big critical mass overall of 5 million-plus potentially. And it's not too far away from where your Fios base is. And you have deep money coming in, potentially, there's more interest from private equity funds and so on and so forth. \r\nAnd I know you've talked about being a lot more disciplined on fiber, but does your breakeven threshold change just given the kind of critical mass you get to in fixed wireless and also the kind of capital alternatives that we are starting to see in the market? That's one. \r\nAnd secondly, on the wireless side, over the last two or three years, I mean, obviously, there's been a pretty big tailwind to service revenue from prices and explicit price increases. So your thoughts on how long that can continue. And when does mix take over and become a bigger component overall from a service revenue growth perspective? And how we should expect that transition to happen would be helpful.\n\nHans E. Vestberg\n\nThank you, Kannan. Yes, I have to go back a little bit when it comes to our broadband strategy. We have a multipurpose network. We build the network once and we have multiple options at the edge. That was sort of the infancy of the Verizon Intelligent Edge Network. From the data center to the edge, we have harmonized everything. We have fiber in between everything. We have multi routers. We have one transport network. That is super important, it's sort of the brain of the network. Then at the edge, we have optionality, what type of access we have. In the ILEC, of course, we're going to continue with our success in Fios and outside, we're doing fixed wireless access. \r\nBut it gives us optionality over time. I like honest economics. I think that, that makes us very competitive in pricing and offerings to our customers. There are, of course, a lot of offerings from people that want to ship in capital. But ultimately, it has paid off for us to be very, very prudent in financial discipline with our own money. But you can never outrule, but that's really my view on it. But I'm creating optionality with the network and Joe and his team are super agile if we need to be within that. \r\nOn the wireless, I would say, I mean, if you look at our Business side, they have great offerings in the market. They have taken the fair share over 10 quarters, and then have also made new offerings so they can expand. So I think they both have done quantity and value. And wireless, of course, on the Consumer side, they have historically have more ARPA increase with new offerings, new pricing, new products, rather than volumes. But you have seen us performing in the last part of the year. \r\nAnd I think Sampath and his team, they have said that they want to increase the part of getting new customers. But again, it will be financial discipline, and we should get the right customers. And if you look at our quality of our Consumer base, it's just amazing, and we will continue to be financially prudent on that. But clearly, we want to have more volumes and -- but not to any cost, we will do it with the right cost and the right product to our customers.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Peter Supino of Wolfe Research.\n\nPeter Lawler Supino\n\nOn the subject of consumption and network utilization, I wondered if you could update us on the number of gigabytes per month that postpaid phone customers are consuming nowadays and extending that thought over the next few years, does that growth and the robust FWA business that you're building suggests that we should prepare for densification or other radio access network or spectrum costs for capacity over the next several years, certainly not a 2024 question.\n\nHans E. Vestberg\n\nYes. I'll go back to how we build the network because building the network is so very important because the biggest challenge with a lot of traffic is, of course, transporting it in an efficient way, having your own fiber and that we've already built. \r\nWhen it comes to the growth in the network, yes, everybody is using the network more. It's no different between fixed wireless access and Fios. And of course, wireless consumers are using the network more as well. But we have built a very stable network all the way from the data centers to the edge. And then, of course, we have assets that nobody else has. We have a lot of our traffic on millimeter wave, which is the cheapest way to deliver data in the market by far and we have our C-Band just coming out. So -- and we have our best engineers. So I feel really good with that people and customers are using our network more. That's what this was intended for, and we have designed it like that.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Bryan Kraft of Deutsche Bank.\n\nBryan D. Kraft\n\nI had two, if I could. First, following up on John's earlier question, can you give us a sense for how much of the year-over-year improvement in gross adds in the fourth quarter was the result of healthy industry volumes versus the improved execution and product that you've got in the market now? And additionally on that, did you see stronger performance in December versus the rest of the quarter? I asked because I think your last public presentation was in early December, and your results seem to even more positive than your tone back then. So it seems like maybe you picked up momentum as the quarter progressed. \r\nAnd then I just had a separate question on the issue of lead cables. I was wondering if you would comment on the latest media report that the EPA has conducted its own testing, some of your lead sheet cables that have shown lead levels above EPA standard for safety. Any sense for whether these reports are accurate? And if so, how you're thinking about the potential impact at this point around this issue?\n\nHans E. Vestberg\n\nYes. Thank you, Bryan. Let me start with the market in the fourth quarter. We don't know. I mean the others haven't reported. We only know that we have performed really well. And -- but that has been -- it's not a one quarter phenomenon. If you think about from the second quarter, third quarter, even in the first quarter, we were sequentially improving all the time, and we have done that in a disciplined ways with a lot of actions and that we need to keep up. \r\nSo -- and then the comment on how the quarter shaped so you probably talk about consumer more than anything else. I think we're solid through the quarter, there was nothing sort of different during the month in the quarter. We were solid through the quarter, doing well performance. \r\nOn the lead. As I said before, we take that very seriously. I cannot comment what media is doing. We work with all the agencies and see that we are following this up and we have revealed all the information we have. So we don't have any more. We have also disclosed how much lead cable we have in the network, which is very little. But again, we take it seriously and we work with all the agencies.\n\nOperator\n\nYour last question will come from Walter Piecyk of LightShed.\n\nWalter Paul Piecyk\n\nHans, this is -- I apologize, probably the fourth time you're coming back to the gross add question. But I think earlier, you made mention of kind of the change in structure from nationalization to localization. I think that was something that Sampath had kind of stated as one of his specific things and probably something that maybe, could be more sustainable than just a change in a rate plan that obviously could be replicated or just addresses the market. So just a couple of questions on that. \r\nFirst, if you think about kind of the ramp in fourth quarter, I know this is kind of a soft question, but like the impact of localization, and that's change in the structure of the sales organization versus myPlan, which had a larger impact. And then, I guess, more importantly, the sustainability, meaning that, yes, you typically do see sequential growth seasonally around this time of the year. Obviously, more pronounced this year than past. \r\nBut are we going to see even more sequential growth or more abnormal growth in the first half of the year as some of the implementation of that localization continues? Or have we largely already seen that impact as we go into 2024?\n\nHans E. Vestberg\n\nWalt, I think that was -- it's a good question. So the whole -- remember, we started with the network as the C-Band is sort of rolling out in different ZIP codes all the time, we are engaging locally. The same we did with the Consumer group to be much more local, to be able to do local marketing, cater forward the local market, have local flavors of our marketing. We worked with a sports league like NFL and the teams in different markets to see that happen. \r\nSo of course, I'm going to attribute part of our growth during the year to the decentralization. But we just got started to see that we have that team in place and Sampath and the team are working with them with his market precedent -- make it. But it's also a sign of where the market is going. You need to be local, and you need to be on the ground in the different societies in order to perform and be knowledge. And Verizon is most visible in all the grounds and now we're taking next step with our structure. So very pleased with what I've seen so far, but more to be done.\n\nAnthony T. Skiadas\n\nYes, Walt. I'll just add on to what Hans said. The regional structure is a lot closer to the customer, and we've run the business this way for many, many years. And we can do things like different promos for different markets and local resources and decision-making and the localization offset some of the price up as well. So we feel really good about where we're heading, especially with the Tier 2 and Tier 3 rollouts with C-Band and the opportunity that provides.\n\nWalter Paul Piecyk\n\nTony, can you also remind us when the Board considers share repurchase as it relates to leverage? And I think the leverage that you mentioned earlier in the call excludes the unsecured debt because you were referencing a 2.6 number. So assuming we're basing it off the 2.6 number, I think your target -- your long-term target was 2.0. So clearly, you wouldn't let it go below 2.0 before you start buying stock back, but is there a consideration under 2.5 where the Board starts to consider share repurchase?\n\nHans E. Vestberg\n\nThank you, Walt. I think this is something that we are being very disciplined. Our capital allocation priority is clear. Number one, money to the business, basically our CapEx; number two, continue to put the Board in a place so they can continue to increase our dividend and then number three paying down debt. \r\nWhen we come down to 2.25 we have said we will start considering buybacks, but our ultimate long-term goal is to get around 2. So yes, that's the plan. But of course, it will play in where the market is, where the interest rates are, where the capital is and where our equity is. But clearly, that's the plan we have right now, and the Board is fully tuned to that plan.\n\nBrady Connor\n\nYes. Thanks, Walt. Brad, back to you.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon Conference Services.

The company operates four separate divisions: Safety and Industrial, Healthcare, Transportation and Electronics, and Consumer. 3M is facing several lawsuits, including nearly 300,000 claims that its earplugs used by U.S. combat troops and produced by a subsidiary were defective. On Sept. 18, 2023, 3M agreed to pay $6.01 billion to settle lawsuits regarding the defective ear plugs. Additionally, the company is still waiting to hear if its $10.3 billion water utility settlement will be approved with more than 20 states.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn the most recent third quarter, revenue declined 3.6% to $8.3 billion, but this was $280 million above estimates. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.68 was 33 cents more than projected. Adjusted organic growth fell 3.1% for the period. Health Care had organic growth of 2.4%, while Transportation and Electronics, Consumer, and Safety and Industrial were down 1.8%, 7.2%, and 5.8%, respectively.\n\n3M updated its outlook for 2023 as well, with the company now expecting adjusted EPS in a range of $8.95 to $9.15 for the year, up from $8.60 to $9.10 previously. 3M\u2019s innovation is one of the company\u2019s greatest competitive advantages. The company targets research and development (R&D) spending equivalent to 6% of sales (about $2 billion annually) to create new products to meet consumer demand. This spending has proven to be very beneficial to the company as 30% of sales during the last fiscal year were from products that did not exist five years ago\n\nStory continues\n\n3M is likely to generate enough cash flow to maintain its dividend. 3M has increased its dividend for over 60 years. MMM stock currently yields 5.5%.\n\nVerizon (VZ) 5G stocks, VZ stock\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nVerizon (NYSE:VZ) is a communication services stock and one of the largest wireless carriers in the country. Wireless contributes three-quarters of all revenues, and broadband and cable services account for about a quarter of sales. The company\u2019s network covers about 300 million people and 98% of the U.S.\n\nOn Oct. 24, 2023, Verizon reported earnings results for the third quarter. For the quarter, revenue declined 2.7% to $33.3 billion, but this was in line with expectations. Adjusted EPS of $1.22 was 4 cents more than anticipated. Verizon had postpaid phone net losses of 51,000, but this was an improvement both on year-over-year and sequential basis.\n\nRevenue for the Consumer segment declined 2.3% to $25.3 billion, though wireless service revenue improved 2.9% due to higher average revenue per account. Broadband totaled 434,000 net new customers during the period, the fourth consecutive quarter of at least 400,000 net adds. Wireless retail postpaid phone churn rate remains low at 0.85%.\n\nVerizon reaffirmed guidance for 2023 as well with the company still expecting adjusted EPS of $4.55 to $4.85 for the year. Wireless service revenue is still projected to grow 2.5% to 4.5%. Free cash flow for 2023 is projected to be $18 billion, $1 billion higher than previously expected.\n\nThe strong free cash flow of the company fuels its high dividend payout. Verizon has increased its dividend for 19 consecutive years. VZ stock currently yields 6.6%.\n\nInternational Business Machines (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\n\nInternational Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) is a global information technology company that provides integrated enterprise solutions for software, hardware and services. IBM\u2019s focus is running mission critical systems for large, multi-national customers and governments. IBM typically provides end-to-end solutions. The company now has four business segments: Software, Consulting, Infrastructure and Financing. IBM had annual revenue of about $60.5 billion in 2022.\n\nIBM reported solid results for Q3 2023 on Oct. 25, 2023. Companywide revenue rose 3.5% while diluted adjusted earnings per share climbed 22% on a year-over-year basis. Also, IBM\u2019s revenue and earnings are being impacted by the strong U.S. dollar causing a 1.1% headwind. Software revenue increased 6.3% in comparable quarters due to 7% growth in Hybrid Platform and Solutions and a 5% increase in Transaction Processing. Revenue was up 8% for RedHat, 13% for Automation, 6% for Data and AI, and -3% for Security.\n\nThe firm launched watsonx for generative AI and machine learning. Consulting revenue increased 5% due to a 5% rise in Business Transformation, a 1% increase in Technology Consulting, and 7% growth in Application Operations. The book-to-bill ratio is a healthy 1.15x.\n\nFuture growth will be driven largely by acquisitions. So far in 2023, it has announced the purchase of StepZen and NS1. IBM has acquired 30 companies under the present CEO. Also, IBM is reinforcing its AI offerings as seen by the Apptio acquisition. IBM forecasts revenue growth in the mid-single-digits and free cash flow of about $10.5 billion in 2023.\n\nIBM has increased its dividend for 29 consecutive years, qualifying it as a Dividend Aristocrat. The 2023 dividend payout ratio of approximately 70% indicates a secure dividend. IBM stock yields 4.1%.\n\nOn the date of publication, Bob Ciura\u00a0did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

General Electric also enjoys a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating reflecting upward trending earnings revisions. Following the high marks and impressive stock performance GE posted a strong quarter and full year of earnings.\n\nGeneral Electric reported Q4 earnings that exceeded expectations, with a 9% decrease in EPS to $1.13, surpassing the anticipated 28% drop. Revenue climbed 15% to $19.4 billion, beating expectations of a drop to $17.18 billion. Despite the positive results, GE stock opened lower after reaching a six-year high the previous day. However, by mid-day the stock rallied to unchanged, indicating strong buying pressure.\n\nThe company is undergoing a transformation into a pure-play aerospace company, planning to break out its power and renewables business as GE Vernova in April. GE's health care spinoff, GE HealthCare Technologies, debuted on the Nasdaq in January 2023.\n\nIn 2023, GE reported total orders of $79.2 billion, a 25% increase, and total revenues of $68.0 billion, a 17% rise. The profit margin increased by 1,640 basis points to 15.0%, and adjusted profit margin rose by 310 basis points to 8.8% organically. Full-year continuing EPS was $7.98, a significant improvement, and adjusted EPS reached $2.81.\n\nFor Q1 2024, GE expects high-single-digit revenue growth, adjusted EPS of $0.60 to $0.65, and free cash flow in line with net income growth.\n\nJohnson & Johnson\n\nJohnson and Johnson JNJ currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating, but was able to beat earnings estimates, nonetheless.\n\nJohnson & Johnson reported Q4 earnings and revenue that slightly exceeded expectations. The pharmaceutical and medical devices businesses experienced a surge in sales, contributing to a total of $21.40 billion in sales for the quarter, marking a 7.3% increase from the same period in 2022.\n\nStory continues\n\nNet income for the quarter was $4.13 billion, or $1.70 per share, compared to $3.23 billion, or $1.22 per share, in the year-ago period. Adjusted earnings per share were $2.29, slightly beating the expected $2.28. J&J provided a full-year guidance for 2024, anticipating sales between $87.8 billion and $88.6 billion, with adjusted earnings ranging from $10.55 to $10.75 per share.\n\nThe medical devices business generated sales of $7.67 billion, up 13.3%, while pharmaceutical sales reached $13.72 billion, with a notable contribution from drugs like Darzalex and Stelara.\n\nDespite challenges such as the loss of patent protection on Stelara, J&J remains optimistic about its pharmaceutical unit's growth, projecting a compounded annual growth rate of 5% to 7% between 2025 and 2030.\n\nJNJ stock is down (-1.2%) on the day, but is printing a large reversal candle, indicating strong buying interest. TradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nVerizon Communications\n\nVerizon Communications VZ too has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating but is surging higher following earnings. VZ stock is up nearly 6% following the meeting.\n\nVerizon Communications reported Q4 earnings that met Wall Street estimates, with earnings per share of $1.08 on an adjusted basis, a 9% decrease from the previous year, and revenue of $35.1 billion, dipping 0.3%. Despite this, VZ stock rose to an 11-month high.\n\nThe key highlight was the addition of 449,000 postpaid phone customers, surpassing expectations and indicating momentum in the consumer market. Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg emphasized continuous improvement, particularly in postpaid phone net adds, marking the best performance in two years.\n\nDespite challenges, such as the loss of the \"best network\" marketing claim, Verizon aims for a balanced approach to growth and profitability in 2024. For the full year 2023, Verizon reported a total consolidated operating revenue of $134.0 billion, down 2.1% from the previous year, and full-year cash flow from operations increased to $37.5 billion. Consumer wireless service revenue saw a 3.2% YoY increase in Q4 2023, driven by pricing actions and higher adoption of premium price plans.\n\nThe company added 318,000 postpaid consumer phone customers in Q4, with the C-Band deployment contributing to improved performance. Verizon's focus on generating growth in service revenue, free cash flow, and EBITDA is part of its strategy amid industry challenges and changes.\n\nVerizon Communications is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 8.6x, which is below the industry average and below its 10-year median of 12x. It is also worth noting that the company pays a hefty 6.7% dividend yield to shareholders.

Verizon hit the earnings number on the nose and edged out sales projections, delivering $35.1 billion in sales for the quarter.\n\nVerizon sales and earnings\n\nBut not all the news was good. Sales for the final quarter of the year may have been better than expected, but they still declined slightly (down 0.3%) in comparison to Q4 2022. Adjusted earnings were also down year over year, and when calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles, Verizon actually lost money for the quarter -- $0.64 per share -- versus earning a GAAP profit of $1.56 per share in Q4 2022.\n\nThese results were both better and worse than Verizon's numbers for 2023 as a whole. For the full year, sales were down worse -- 2.1% to $134 billion -- but GAAP profits were positive $2.75 per share. (The bad news: This was barely half the $5.06-per-share GAAP profit that Verizon earned for all of 2022.)\n\nOn the other hand, Verizon scored a big increase in free cash flow (FCF) in 2023, with total cash profits for the year up 33% to $18.7 billion. If you ask me, that's the really good news today -- and the best reason for bidding up Verizon stock.\n\nWhere will Verizon be in 2024?\n\nNow what about 2024? How will Verizon aim to do even better this year than last?\n\nWell, first, the company needs to grow its business instead of shrinking it, and Verizon has a plan to do just that, aiming for somewhere between 2% and 3.5% sales growth in 2024. Management didn't give a GAAP number for this year's earnings target but did say that its adjusted profit should range from $4.50 to $4.70 per share.\n\nAnd here's the problem with that range: Its entirety falls below the $4.71 per share in \"adjusted\" earnings that Verizon says it earned in 2023! Thus, management appears to be planning to grow its sales but shrink its profits this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nNow, the good news is that Verizon does say its capital spending should be lighter this year than last (as little as $17 billion to $17.5 billion, which would be significantly less than the $18.8 billion Verizon spent on capex in 2023). If cash flow holds up, therefore (and with revenues growing again, it should), Verizon should be able to end up growing its free cash flow even if \"earnings\" take a hit this year.\n\nMy back-of-the-envelope math suggests FCF could even rise as high as $20.6 billion in 2024, which, when weighed against the company's $175.6 billion market capitalization, suggests Verizon stock is selling for a P/FCF ratio of only 8.5x current-year earnings. For a business growing at 2% and paying a 6.7% dividend yield, that seems a fair price to pay, to me.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Verizon Communications right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Verizon Communications, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Verizon Communications wasn't one of them.

The net gain, the first one after three down quarters, comes as the New York-based company works to win customers lost to rivals AT&T Inc. and T-Mobile US Inc.\n\nVerizon had fallen behind its wireless peers in subscriber growth for years, after costly purchases and strategic missteps allowed competitors to take its share in the already-saturated mobile market.\n\nLast March, the company placed nine-year company veteran Sowmyanarayan Sampath in charge of the consumer division, which represented 76% of Verizon\u2019s revenue in the fourth quarter.

Verizon is the top trending ticker here at \"Yahoo Finance.\" Look at that gains of almost 5% here about half an hour into the trading day. Now, the stock getting a boost after it reported better than expected earnings for the second quarter. Also, added new wireless subscribers, which is a boom, potentially, here for Verizon because we know it generates a good chunk of its revenue from its mobile unit. And getting the vibe on the street because we're getting analysts quick take here following these results, Brad. And the earnings call that just took place with Hans Vestberg making a couple of key comments here, the CEO of Verizon.\n\nBut my two takeaways is that the Street is pretty pleased with these results. KeyBanc saying, that the results did come in somewhat mixed. But they were positive about the fact that those phone net adds did beat the Street's expectations. And then also, Evercore saying that this was a healthy quarter here for the company. A lot of that driven by those subscriber ads. And really, pointing to the fact that there is some optimism here for Verizon in 2024.\n\nBRAD SMITH: Yeah. Some swift reactions you got from analysts who were covering Verizon here this morning. One of them, vital knowledge, the big number in the Q4 report, as you were mentioning, still retail, postpaid, phone ads of 449,000 solidly above the Street's-- get this-- 229,000 forecasts. So healthy phone, net add number, and then the small guidance upside helping bolster the stock here today.\n\nSEANA SMITH: Yeah. And certainly, putting this all in perspective, why this is such a huge deal, when we talk about the net adds that we're getting here for subscribers, Verizon is coming off three straight quarters in a row, where they did disappoint here. So the fact that we are seeing a bit of a turnaround here for the mobile customers, it could signal a bit of a turning point here for the company, and also in terms of the guide, what that means for future growth here. It could be bullish there. So a good reason or a big reason why we're seeing shares up just about 5%.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/video/verizon-sees-wireless-subscriber-growth-160124977.html", "symbols": ["0Q1S.LSE", "BAC.F", "BAC.XETRA", "VERZ34.SA", "VZ.MX", "VZ.US"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.993, "neg": 0.006, "neu": 0.871, "pos": 0.123}}, {"date": "2024-01-23T15:18:23+00:00", "title": "US STOCKS-S&amp;P 500, Nasdaq muted as mixed earnings weigh on risk appetite", "content": "(For a Reuters live blog on U.S., UK and European stock markets, click or type LIVE/ in a news window.)\n\n*\n\nVerizon up after upbeat FY forecast\n\n*\n\nGE's Q1 outlook disappoints, shares fall\n\n*\n\nP&G tops Q2 profit expectations, shares gain\n\n*\n\nIndexes: Dow falls 0.21%, S&P up 0.08%, Nasdaq up 0.14%\n\n(Updated at 9:48 a.m. ET/1448 GMT)\n\nBy Ankika Biswas and Johann M Cherian\n\nJan 23 (Reuters) -\n\nThe benchmark S&P 500 and the Nasdaq were flat on Tuesday as a mixed bag of earnings from industry bellwethers threatened to douse a recent rally, while the Dow treaded water on the back of losses in 3M.\n\n3M\n\ntumbled 9.5% after forecasting dour annual earnings as the company grapples with weak demand, while General Electric dropped 2.1% after the engine maker's bleak quarterly profit forecast.\n\nJohnson & Johnson\n\nfell 2.5% even after reporting quarterly results a nudge above expectations, while Verizon Communications forecast a strong annual profit and posted its highest quarterly subscriber additions in nearly two years, sending its shares up 4.8%.\n\nAll eyes are on the profit outlook for corporate America after major U.S. banks kicked off the ongoing earnings season, which has been mixed so far, with lower profits.\n\n\"A lot of these companies which had a pretty good quarter have issued cautious guidance ... so that weighs on people's minds on whether they should be in this market,\" said Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth.\n\nOf the S&P 500 companies that have reported results thus far, 86.6% surpassed earnings expectations, compared with 93.1% over a week ago, LSEG data showed.\n\nThe benchmark S&P 500 touched a fresh intraday record peak and closed at an all-time high for a second session on Monday, extending a bull-market run, fueled by strength in megacap tech and chip stocks.\n\nThe blue-chip Dow also surpassed the 38,000-point mark for the first time on Monday, gaining for the third trading day.\n\nThe personal consumption expenditure (PCE) index - the Fed's preferred inflation gauge - along with the S&P Global PMI readings and an advance fourth-quarter GDP print this week will be key in assessing the central bank's next policy decision when it meets on Jan. 31.\n\nStory continues\n\nWall Street had lost steam at the start of 2024, struck by a mixed bag of inflation data and Federal Reserve policymakers clamping down on market speculation of interest-rate cuts arriving as early as March this year.\n\nTraders' expectations of U.S. monetary policy easing have now deferred to May, with an 84% odd for an at least 25-basis-point cut, as per the CME Group's FedWatch Tool, compared with earlier expectations of March.\n\nAt 9:48 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 78.55 points, or 0.21%, at 37,923.26, the S&P 500 was up 4.05 points, or 0.08%, at 4,854.48, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 21.07 points, or 0.14%, at 15,381.35.\n\nEight of the 11 S&P 500 sectors crawled higher, with the communication services sector leading with a 0.7% rise.\n\nD.R.

Strong demand for fixed wireless products also led to healthy broadband performance with total broadband net additions of 413,000, including 375,000 fixed wireless net additions.\r\n\r\nVerizon witnessed solid momentum in the wireless business with 449,000 total postpaid phone net additions in the quarter along with retail postpaid net additions of 1,460,000. This buoyed the shares in pre-market trading.\n\nNet Income\n\nOn a GAAP basis, net loss in the quarter was $2,573 million or a loss of 64 cents per share against $6,698 million or $1.56 per share in the prior-year quarter. The year-over-year decrease was primarily attributable to higher operating expenses led by a goodwill impairment charge of $5,841 million. Excluding non-recurring items, quarterly adjusted earnings were $1.08 per share compared with $1.19 in the prior-year quarter. The bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny.\n\nVerizon Communications Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Verizon Communications Inc.

Quote\n\nFor 2023, GAAP earnings declined to $12,095 million or $2.75 per share from $21,748 million or $5.06 per share in 2022. Adjusted earnings for 2023 were $4.71 per share compared with $5.18 in 2022.\n\nRevenues\n\nQuarterly total operating revenues decreased to $35,130 million from $35,251 million in the prior year owing to lower wireless equipment revenues driven by a challenging macroeconomic environment and lower postpaid phone upgrades. The top line beat the consensus estimate of $34,819 million. For 2023, revenues declined to $133,974 million from $136,835 million in 2022.\n\nQuarterly Segment Results\n\nConsumer: Total revenues from this segment improved 0.7% year over year to $26,954 million, as higher service revenues were partially offset by lower equipment revenues in the quarter. However, it exceeded our revenue estimate of $26,133.8 million for the segment led by solid wireless momentum.\r\n\r\nService revenues were up 2.6% to $18,927 million, while wireless equipment revenues declined 1.4% to $6,435 million. Other revenues totaled $1,592 million, down 11.5% year over year.\r\n\r\nThe segment recorded 318,000 wireless retail postpaid phone net additions and 289,000 wireless retail prepaid net losses in the quarter. Wireless retail postpaid churn was 1.08%, while retail postpaid phone churn was 0.88%. The company recorded 53,000 Fios Internet net additions as high demand for reliable fiber optic broadband was spurred by higher video consumption. Fixed wireless broadband net additions were 231,000 for the quarter. However, Verizon registered 62,000 Fios Video net losses in the quarter, reflecting the ongoing shift from traditional linear video to over-the-top offerings.\r\n\r\nThe segment\u2019s operating income remained flat at $7,035 million with a margin of 26.1%. EBITDA increased 2.4% to $10,379 million with a margin of 38.5% compared with 37.9% in the prior-year quarter due to lower costs of wireless equipment.\r\n\r\nBusiness: The segment revenues were down 3.6% to $7,618 million due to lower wireline and wireless equipment revenues, partially offset by growth in wireless service revenue. It also was lower than our estimates of $7,876 million largely due to challenging macroeconomic conditions.\r\n\r\nThe segment had 292,000 wireless retail postpaid net additions in the quarter, including 131,000 postpaid phone net additions. Wireless retail postpaid churn was 1.48%, while retail postpaid phone churn was 1.12%. Fixed wireless broadband net additions were 144,000 for the quarter. Operating income declined to $443 million from $585 million in the year-ago quarter with respective margins of 5.8% and 7.4%. EBITDA was down 4.5% to $1,607 million owing to decline in high margin wireline revenues for a margin of 21.1% compared with 21.3% in the year-earlier quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nOther Quarterly Details\n\nTotal operating expenses increased 23.2% year over year to $34,530 million, while operating income was down 91.7% to $600 million. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA declined to $11,678 million from $11,747 million for respective margins of 33.2% and 33.3%.\n\nCash Flow & Liquidity\n\nVerizon generated $37,475 million of net cash from operating activities in 2023 compared with $37,141 million in the year-ago period. The improvement was primarily due to working capital improvements driven by lower inventory levels, fewer phone upgrades and a modest improvement in customer payment patterns. Free cash flow was $4,074 million for the quarter compared with $1,666 million in the prior-year period.\r\n\r\nAs of Dec 31, 2023, the company had $2,065 million in cash and cash equivalents with $137,701 million of long-term debt compared with respective tallies of $2,605 million and $140,676 million in the year-ago period.\n\nGuidance\n\nFor 2023, Verizon expects wireless service revenue growth in the range of 2%-3.5%. Adjusted EBITDA is likely to grow 1%-3%. The company expects adjusted earnings in the range of $4.50 to $4.70 per share.

This compares to earnings of $1.19 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 0.93%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this largest U.S. cellphone carrier would post earnings of $1.17 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.22, delivering a surprise of 4.27%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nVerizon , which belongs to the Zacks Wireless National industry, posted revenues of $35.13 billion for the quarter ended December 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.90%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $35.25 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nVerizon shares have added about 5% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 1.7%.\n\nWhat's Next for Verizon?\n\nWhile Verizon has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nStory continues\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Verizon: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.13 on $33.55 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $4.60 on $135.71 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Wireless National is currently in the bottom 10% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nOne other stock from the same industry, Cambium (CMBM), is yet to report results for the quarter ended December 2023.\n\nThis company is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.34 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -194.4%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.2% lower over the last 30 days to the current level.\n\nCambium's revenues are expected to be $40.03 million, down 52.6% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE, Nasdaq: VZ) reported strong fourth-quarter and full-year 2023 results highlighted by total wireless postpaid net additions, fixed wireless net additions and increased wireless service revenue.\n\n\"After delivering continuous improvement throughout 2023, we ended the year strong and continue to pursue the right balance of growth and profitability,\" said Verizon Chairman and CEO Hans Vestberg. \"2023 was a year of change. We have the right assets and the best team in place and are well-positioned for growth in 2024.\"\n\nFor fourth-quarter 2023, Verizon reported earnings per share of $(0.64), compared with earnings per share of $1.56 in fourth-quarter 2022. On an adjusted basis1, excluding special items, EPS was $1.08 in fourth-quarter 2023, compared with adjusted EPS1 of $1.19 in fourth-quarter 2022.\n\nFourth-quarter 2023 financial results reflected a pre-tax loss from special items of approximately $7.8 billion. This includes the impacts of a previously disclosed goodwill impairment charge related to our Business reporting unit of $5.8 billion, a market-to-market adjustment for our pension and Other Post Employment Benefits (OPEB) liabilities of $992 million, asset rationalization charges of $325 million primarily relating to Business network assets that Verizon has ceased the use of, a severance charge of $296 million, the amortization of intangible assets related to Tracfone and other acquisitions of $227 million, and a $100 million charge relating to the settlement of a litigation matter regarding certain administrative fees.\n\nFor full-year 2023, Verizon reported $2.75 in EPS, compared with $5.06 for full-year 2022. On an adjusted basis1, excluding special items, 2023 EPS was $4.71, compared with $5.18 for 2022.\n\nConsolidated results\n\nTotal consolidated operating revenue in fourth-quarter 2023 of $35.1 billion, down 0.3 percent from fourth-quarter 2022. The decrease can be attributed to wireless equipment revenue, which was 2.0 percent lower than 2022, as total postpaid upgrades declined by 17.9 percent. Full-year 2023 consolidated operating revenue was $134.0 billion, down 2.1 percent year over year. Total wireless service revenue2 in fourth-quarter 2023 was $19.4 billion, up 3.2 percent year over year, driven primarily by pricing actions implemented in recent quarters, the larger allocation of our administrative and telco recovery fees from other revenue into wireless service revenue, higher premium price plan adoption and growth from fixed wireless access offerings. Full-year 2023 cash flow from operations was $37.5 billion, an increase from $37.1 billion in 2022. This marks a year over year increase of over $300 million, primarily due to working capital improvements. Full-year 2023 capital expenditures were $18.8 billion, down from $23.1 billion in 2022. The company ended 2023 with free cash flow1 of $18.7 billion, an increase from $14.1 billion in 2022. Consolidated net loss for the fourth-quarter 2023 was $2.6 billion, compared to consolidated net income of $6.7 billion in fourth-quarter 2022, and consolidated adjusted EBITDA1 was $11.7 billion, in line with the 2022 result. Verizon's total unsecured debt as of the end of the year was $128.5\u00a0billion, a $2.1 billion increase sequentially, but $2.1 billion lower year over year. The company's net unsecured debt1 at the end of the year was $126.4 billion, a $4.2 billion increase from third-quarter 2023, but $1.6 billion lower year over year. At the end of fourth-quarter 2023, Verizon's ratio of unsecured debt to net income (LTM) was approximately 10.6 times and net unsecured debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio1 was approximately 2.6 times.\n\nVerizon Consumer results\n\nTotal Verizon Consumer revenue in fourth-quarter 2023 was $27.0 billion, an increase of 0.7 percent year over year as growth in service revenue was offset by declines in wireless equipment revenue and other revenue. For full-year 2023, total Consumer revenue was $101.6 billion, a decrease of 1.8 percent from full-year 2022. Wireless service revenue in fourth-quarter 2023 increased 3.2 percent year over year driven primarily by growth in Consumer wireless postpaid Average Revenue Per Account (ARPA) resulting from pricing actions implemented in recent quarters, the larger allocation of our administrative and telco recovery fees from other revenue into wireless service revenue, higher premium price plan adoption, and growth from fixed wireless access offerings. For full-year 2023, total Consumer wireless service revenue was $63.4 billion, an increase of 3.0 percent from full-year 2022. Consumer wireless retail postpaid churn was 1.08 percent in fourth-quarter 2023, and wireless retail postpaid phone churn was 0.88 percent. In fourth-quarter 2023, Consumer reported 318,000 wireless retail postpaid phone net additions, representing an improvement of 369,000 from third-quarter 2023 and 277,000 from fourth-quarter 2022. Consumer postpaid phone gross additions in the fourth-quarter 2023 increased 16.9 percent year over year, the best performance in four years. Verizon continues to see better performance in the markets where C-Band is deployed. In Verizon's first 76 C-Band markets, fourth-quarter growth in Consumer postpaid phone gross additions was more than 8 percentage points better than in non C-Band markets and postpaid phone churn remains lower than non C-Band markets. Consumer reported 289,000 wireless retail prepaid net losses in fourth-quarter 2023. Consumer reported 231,000 fixed wireless net additions and 53,000 Fios Internet net additions in fourth-quarter 2023. Consumer Fios revenue was $2.9 billion in fourth-quarter 2023, an increase of 1.0 percent year over year. Full-year 2023 Consumer Fios revenue was $11.6 billion, relatively flat year over year. In fourth-quarter 2023, Consumer operating income was $7.0 billion, an increase of 0.1 percent year over year, and segment operating income margin was 26.1 percent, a decrease from 26.3 percent in fourth-quarter 2022. Full-year 2023 Consumer operating income was $29.0 billion, an increase of 0.6 percent year over year, and segment operating income margin was 28.5 percent, an increase from 27.9 percent in full-year 2022. Segment EBITDA1 in fourth-quarter 2023 was $10.4 billion, an increase of 2.4 percent year over year. This improvement can be attributed to wireless service revenue growth and lower upgrade volumes. Segment EBITDA margin1 in fourth-quarter 2023 was 38.5 percent, an increase from 37.9 percent in fourth-quarter 2022. Full-year 2023 segment EBITDA margin1 was 41.4 percent, an increase from 40.2 percent in 2022.\n\nVerizon Business results\n\nTotal Verizon Business revenue was $7.6 billion in fourth-quarter 2023, a decrease of 3.6 percent year over year as lower wireline revenue and lower wireless equipment revenue was partially offset by higher wireless service revenue. For full-year 2023, total Business revenue was $30.1 billion, a 3.1 percent decrease year over year. Business wireless service revenue in fourth-quarter 2023 was $3.4 billion, an increase of 3.0 percent year over year. This was driven by the larger allocation of our administration and telco recovery fees from other revenue into wireless service revenue, continued strong net additions and the benefit of pricing actions implemented earlier in the year. Full-year 2023 Business wireless service revenue was $13.4 billion, an increase of 4.1 percent compared to full-year 2022. Business reported 292,000 wireless retail postpaid net additions in fourth-quarter 2023, including 131,000 postpaid phone net additions. This was the 10th consecutive quarter that Business reported more than 125,000 postpaid phone net additions. Business continues to grow volumes and expand its relationships with customers strengthening its position as a wireless market share leader. Business wireless retail postpaid churn was 1.48 percent in fourth-quarter 2023, and wireless retail postpaid phone churn was 1.12 percent. Business reported 144,000 fixed wireless net additions in fourth-quarter 2023. In fourth-quarter 2023, Verizon Business operating income was $443 million, a decrease of 24.3 percent year over year, and segment operating income margin was 5.8 percent, a decrease from 7.4 percent in fourth-quarter 2022. Full-year 2023 segment operating income was $2.1 billion, a decrease of 21.5 percent year over year, and segment operating income margin was 6.9 percent, compared with 8.5 percent in full-year 2022. Segment EBITDA1 in fourth-quarter 2023 was $1.6 billion, a decrease of 4.5 percent year over year, driven by continued declines in high margin wireline revenues. Segment EBITDA margin1 in fourth-quarter 2023 was 21.1 percent, a decrease from 21.3 percent in fourth-quarter 2022. For the full year, segment EBITDA margin1 was 21.8 percent, a decrease from 22.3 percent in 2022.\n\nOutlook and guidance\n\nThe company does not provide a reconciliation for any of the following adjusted (non-GAAP) forecasts because it cannot, without unreasonable effort, predict the special items that could arise, and the company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information.\n\nFor 2024, Verizon expects the following:\n\nTotal wireless service revenue growth2 of 2.0 percent to 3.5 percent.

The ongoing rollout of 5G networks globally presents an enticing opportunity for investors. However, this burgeoning market has challenges, so wagering on the right 5G stock picks is imperative. 5G connectivity, known for its ultra-fast speeds, remarkably lower latency and capability to support an unprecedented number of connected devices, is set to revolutionize many sectors globally.\n\nFurthermore, the burgeoning 5G services market is anticipated to expand at a staggering CAGR of 59.4% from 2023 to 2030, according to Grand View Research. This represents a golden opportunity for investors to place their bets on the top 5G stocks at the forefront of this transformative shift, promising a chance to be part of a tech evolution.\n\nQualcomm\u00a0(QCOM) Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on the side of a building in San Jose, CA.\n\nSource: jejim / Shutterstock.com\n\nQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is an American semiconductor titan, riding the 5G wave with aplomb. Stationed in the tech hub of San Diego, CA, this tech behemoth boasts a legacy of spearheading critical wireless innovations. From the bedrock of CDMA 2000 to 4G and now 5G, the firm\u2019s strategic foresight is unequaled. Moreover, it forecasts a staggering annual 5G capital expenditure surge, hitting an astronomical $265 billion over the upcoming 15 years, signifying a seismic industry transformation.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn the financial realm, Qualcomm\u2019s prowess shines bright. Its fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of $2.02 per share eclipsed the anticipated consensus of $1.91. Additionally, the company\u2019s automotive sector sales are on an impressive trajectory, marking a significant 15% year-over-year growth, reaching $535 million. Peering into the future with confidence, Qualcomm forecasts a rosy first quarter, with sales projected to fall between $9.1 billion and $9.9 billion.\n\nT-Mobile US\u00a0(TMUS) Merger Speeds Up the Comeback of T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nStory continues\n\nT-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) is a front-runner in the 5G sphere, making it a top pick for savvy investors eyeing the sector\u2019s boom. As a global 5G infrastructure leader, T-Mobile has built the largest and fastest 5G network in the United States. This achievement sets the stage for a streak of continued outperformance this year.\n\nMoreover, in an innovative move, T-Mobile marked an industry first by successfully executing a six-carrier aggregation call in the sub-6 GHz spectrum, achieving tremendous bandwidth. This technical milestone underscores its commitment to advancing 5G technology.\n\nFinancially, T-Mobile\u2019s financial position is equally striking, with its third quarter results being a testament to this. TMUS reported a whopping 322% year-over-year increase in net income, equal to $2.1 billion. Furthermore, earnings per share leaped by an astounding 355% year-over-year, while free cash flow numbers nearly doubled to a robust $4 billion. \u00a0It will post its fourth quarter results on Thursday, with average earnings per share estimates at $1.90, a 61% bump on YoY.\n\nCisco Systems\u00a0(CSCO) the cisco (CSCO) logo on a wall\n\nSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com\n\nCisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) is another formidable contender in the 5G arena, earmarking itself as a top stock to watch in 2024.

Also, Meraki, its cutting-edge 5G cloud wireless solution, stands out with its MG51 and MG51E models boasting lower latency, heightened security and faster speed times.\n\nThe fiscal year 2023 was nothing short of stellar for Cisco, with a revenue bump of 10% year-over-year, hitting a whopping $57 billion. This impressive growth is a testament to Cisco\u2019s adept market strategy, capturing shares in AI, security and cloud domains. The convergence of 5G and cloud security forms a major tailwind for Cisco, propelling it towards another year of powerful performance in 2024. This blend of innovation and market adaptability positions Cisco as a leader in shaping the future of 5G technology.\n\nVerizon Communications\u00a0(VZ) 5G stocks, VZ stock\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nVerizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) has been steadily fortifying its position in the 5G landscape. With its operational wings, the Verizon Consumer Group and Verizon Business Group, it delivers a variety of services, notably 5G and 4G wireless connectivity, alongside high-speed Internet and digital TV across the U.S.\n\nHowever, VZ\u2019s third quarter did have its challenges. The company reported a dip in total operating revenue, down 2.6% to $33.3 billion, and a 2.8% drop in net income year-over-year. Despite these hurdles, Verizon surpassed expectations with an EPS of $1.22, beating the consensus by a notable 4.3%. Additionally, its attractive 6.76% annual dividend yield remains a strong pull for the investing world. As eyes turn to Tuesday\u2019s upcoming fourth quarter report, with analyst earnings estimated at $1.07, reflecting a 10% year-over-year drop, the anticipation is tinged with cautious optimism.\n\nBroadcom\u00a0(AVGO)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a formidable player in the semiconductor sphere and stands out as one of the leading 5G stocks. Renowned for its diverse product array, Broadcom\u2019s prowess in sectors including set-top box SoCs and RF semiconductors has propelled it to the center stage of 5G technology. Notably, its Trident 5-X12 chip, equipped with the innovative NetGNT neural network, doubles bandwidth while cutting power consumption by 25%.\n\nFinancially, Broadcom\u2019s recent performance has been encouraging, with a revenue leap to $8.88 billion in the third quarter, up 5% year-over-year, and a significant jump in adjusted EBITDA from $5.38 to $5.80 billion. Additionally, the repurchase of 2.9 million shares totaling $2.17 billion reflects confidence in its financial standing.\n\nBroadcom\u2019s 2024 outlook is brimming with ambition. The company forecasts an impressive $50 billion revenue, with EBITDA margins hitting 60%. Moreover, despite acknowledging some cyclical slowness in its broadband and storage semiconductor businesses, Wall Street remains optimistic about Broadcom\u2019s prospects, especially at the back end of the year.\n\nCrown Castle International\u00a0(CCI) Image of Crown Castle (CCI) logo on a web browser highlighted through the lens of a magnifying glass\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrown Castle International (NYSE:CCI) stands tall as a top real-estate-investment-trust (REIT) in the 5G landscape, boasting an impressive arsenal of over 40,000 cell towers.

Furthermore, with it poised for a leap in its small cell segment, CCI predicts 13% organic growth in 2024. This trajectory, fueled by powerful investments and the addition of new nodes, signals a bright future in this niche.\n\nFinancially, CCI demonstrates resilience, with a healthy dividend yield of 5.8%. Management\u2019s forward-looking stance anticipates a return to growth in the 7% to 8% range by 2025. Additionally, with the 5G expansion wave, CCI is well-positioned to reap benefits from the soaring demand for wireless infrastructure. Furthermore, with the arrival of Anthony Melone as the interim CEO following Jay Brown\u2019s retirement, CCI could be in for a spirited recovery.\n\nAs it gears up to release its fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday, expectations are set for an EPS of 74 cents, reflecting a 20.43% dip from the previous year. Nevertheless, the seeds of a potential turnaround under new leadership are keeping investors keenly watching CCI\u2019s next moves.\n\nWipro\u00a0(WIT) network server room with computers for digital tv ip communications and internet,3d rendering.

That sounds like a great proposition, doesn't it? Such opportunities don't come around as often as we'd like.\n\nHowever, I think some stocks currently offer the chance to pay less and receive more thanks to their attractive valuations and juicy dividends. Here are three ultra-high-yield dividend stocks that are simply too cheap to ignore.\n\n1. Ares Capital\n\nAres Capital(NASDAQ: ARCC) is the largest publicly traded business development company (BDC) based on market cap. It provides financing to middle-market businesses with a focus on the upper tier of the market.\n\nThe company's dividend yield is nearly 9.5%. This sky-high yield is largely due to BDCs being required to return at least 90% of their income to shareholders in the form of dividends to be exempt from paying federal taxes.\n\nAres Capital's shares trade at only 8.8 times forward earnings. Its price-to-book ratio is a low 1.07. These metrics would make any stock's valuation look attractive.\n\nBut Ares Capital isn't cheap because it's performing poorly. The company's business is booming with core earnings per share jumping 18% year over year in the third quarter of 2023. It has also delivered total returns that topped the S&P 500 by more than 85% since its initial public offering in 2004. Ares Capital's total return has also beaten the S&P 500 in the last three-year and five-year periods as well.\n\n2. Pfizer\n\nPfizer(NYSE: PFE) ranks as one of the largest drugmakers in the world. The company has been in business since 1849. It currently markets eight products with annual sales of $1 billion or more.\n\nBig pharma stocks have long been favorites for income investors because of their strong dividends. Pfizer is no exception. That's especially the case now with its dividend yield at nearly 6%.\n\nPfizer's forward earnings multiple is 12.5, well below the healthcare sector average of nearly 18.4. This low valuation is the result of declining sales for the company's COVID-19 products and the upcoming loss of exclusivity for several top-selling drugs.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, Pfizer's long-term prospects look good. The drugmaker expects to add roughly $20 billion in annual revenue by 2030 from new product launches and new indications for existing products. Business development deals could generate another $25 billion in additional annual revenue.\n\n3. Verizon Communications\n\nYou're probably familiar with Verizon Communications(NYSE: VZ) even if you're not one of the company's customers. Verizon provides wireless services in the U.S. and other countries. It's one of the largest telecommunications companies in the world.\n\nVerizon's dividend yield of over 6.8% should catch investors' attention. In addition to this ultra-high yield, the company has also increased its dividend for 17 consecutive years. That's the longest streak of dividend hikes in the U.S. telecommunications industry.\n\nWhat about valuation? Verizon looks pretty good on that front, too. Its shares currently trade at close to 8.4 times expected earnings. By comparison, the average forward earnings multiple of S&P 500 stocks in the communications services sector is 17.3.\n\nTo be sure, Verizon faces some challenges. The wireless market is highly competitive. However, the company appears to be headed in the right direction. Verizon reported a significant improvement in free cash flow in the third quarter of 2023. Its streaming bundle with Netflix and Max should also attract more subscribers.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Verizon Communications right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Verizon Communications, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Verizon Communications wasn't one of them.
