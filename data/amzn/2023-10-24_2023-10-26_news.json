The shares gained about 3.5% in extended trading on his comments.\n\nJassy has been winning over Wall Street this year with deep cost cuts and a focus on boosting profit. Under his guidance, the Seattle-based company has become increasingly reliant on services that tend to make more money than the original business of hawking goods online, including advertising, logistics services for independent merchants and renting computing power to corporations.\n\n\u201cThe retail giant\u2019s slowdown last year appears to be in the rear-view mirror as it has embarked on significant cost-cutting throughout this year and sharpened its focus on key growth areas, such as its high-margin online marketplace \u2014 and the services it can sell to those sellers \u2014 and advertising,\u201d said Zak Stambor, an analyst at Insider Intelligence.\n\nSales for its cloud unit, Amazon Web Services, increased 12% to $23.1 billion. The business\u2019s operating income of $6.98 billion was about $1.3 billion more than analysts expected. AWS, which tends to account for more profit than the rest of the company combined, reported the highest operating margin since the first quarter of 2022.\n\nChief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky stopped short of saying that AWS growth has bottomed out, explaining that the division is seeing a number of cross currents. But it may be a sign the pullback in corporate spending on cloud services isn\u2019t over yet, and a potential worry for investors.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe results provided more evidence of Jassy\u2019s cost-cutting effort, which has scrutinized expenses across the company. Amazon\u2019s spending on sales and marketing declined, a first since at least 2015. The growth in spending on technology and infrastructure, a category that includes the salaries of software engineers and costs for AWS servers, rose by just 8.8%, about a quarter of the rate of a year ago.\n\nThird-quarter revenue gained 13% to $143.1 billion, Amazon said Thursday in a statement. Analysts, on average, estimated $141.6 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Operating income increased to $11.2 billion, compared with $2.5 billion in the period a year ago. Analysts, on average, estimated $7.71 billion.\n\nThe company\u2019s central online stores also produced a better-than-expected performance. The unit generated $57.3 billion, a 7% increase from the period a year earlier. The quarter included Prime Day, Amazon\u2019s mid-summer shopping bonanza. Advertising sales jumped 26% to $12 billion, also topping estimates.\n\nAmazon projected sales of $160 billion to $167 billion in the quarter ending in December, compared with analysts\u2019 average estimate of $166.6 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Operating income will be $7 billion to $11 billion in the period. Analysts, on average, projected $8.71 billion.\n\nWhile Olsavsky said the consumer is \u201cspending money, but cautious and deal driven,\u201d Stambor, of Insider Intelligence, was more optimistic. Amazon\u2019s \u201csuccessful Prime Big Deal Days event \u2014 which Insider Intelligence believes generated $5.9 billion in US retail e-commerce sales, an 8% gain year-over-year \u2014 give it strong momentum as we head into the heart of the holiday season,\u201d Stambor said.\n\nAmazon\u2019s stock closed at $119.57 in New York and has jumped 43% this year.\n\n(Updates with extended trading in the second paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nSam Bankman-Fried Takes Stand in Reminder of Crypto\u2019s Epic Fall X, One Year Later: How Elon Musk Made a Mess of Twitter\u2019s Business Venezuela\u2019s Primary Sweep Puts Maduro and Biden in the Hot Seat No One Understands Corporate Boycotts Like This Former Trump Researcher The War That Broke Social Media\n\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-posts-strong-revenue-profit-203406234.html", "symbols": ["AMZ.F", "AMZ.XETRA", "AMZN.MX", "AMZN.US", "AMZO34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.987, "neg": 0.043, "neu": 0.853, "pos": 0.104}}, {"date": "2023-10-26T21:42:22+00:00", "title": "Amazon.com Inc (AMZN) Reports Q3 2023 Earnings: Net Sales Rise 13% to $143.1 Billion", "content": "Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) reports a 13% increase in net sales to $143.1 billion in Q3 2023.

A quarter ago, it was expected that this online retailer would post earnings of $0.34 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.63, delivering a surprise of 85.29%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nAmazon , which belongs to the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, posted revenues of $143.08 billion for the quarter ended September 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.10%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $127.1 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nAmazon shares have added about 44.5% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 9%.\n\nWhat's Next for Amazon?\n\nWhile Amazon has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nStory continues\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Amazon: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.68 on $167.01 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $2.24 on $570.16 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Internet - Commerce is currently in the top 39% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nAnother stock from the same industry, Expedia (EXPE), has yet to report results for the quarter ended September 2023.

For young people, \u201cGrandpa Google knows the answer and will help you with homework. But when it comes to doing interesting things, they like to start elsewhere.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department rested its case last week, arguing that Google illegally maintains a monopoly in online search by paying more than $10 billion a year to tech rivals, smartphone makers and wireless providers in exchange for being set as the preselected \u201cdefault\u201d on mobile phones and web browsers. Google, in part through Raghavan\u2019s testimony, argues that the company faces staunch competition from not only other search engines but other online sites that young people engage with for everything from entertainment to shopping to cooking.\n\nRaghavan\u2019s testimony served as a rebuttal to the idea that Google could be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for internet search, an argument made earlier in the trial by Justice Department witnesses, including Microsoft Corp. Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella. US v. Google, which is expected to last 10 weeks, is the government\u2019s biggest tech monopoly trial of the last two decades.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead More: DOJ Google Antitrust Case Wraps With Apple Deal on Center Stage\n\nRaghavan underscored that Google was at risk of losing market share to apps like TikTok and Instagram, particularly because engaging with them diverges so sharply from traditional online search behavior \u2014 going to a search engine via a web browser, and typing a query.\n\n\u201cThe fastest growing section of queries is young people using their camera to point to things,\u201d Raghavan said on the witness stand.\n\n\u201cOur user research shows where young people go, older users follow,\u201d he added, explaining why Google has focused on TikTok. Raghavan made similar remarks in 2022, relying on internal Google research, stating that \u201csomething like almost 40% of young people, when they\u2019re looking for a place for lunch, they don\u2019t go to Google Maps or Search. They go to TikTok or Instagram.\u201d\n\nPandu Nayak, a Google vice president for search, testified last week that Google has focused on TikTok of late to figure out how younger people are searching for information.\n\n\u201cYoung people particularly are increasingly turning to TikTok for their information needs, and we want to understand what is it that they\u2019re doing there, what are they finding useful, what should we do with Google to address that,\u201d he said.\n\nAmazon, the e-commerce giant, is also encroaching on Google\u2019s search dominance.\n\n\u201cUsers are increasingly beginning their shopping journeys on Amazon,\u201d said Raghavan, echoing testimony from an earlier Google executive who said that advertisers have been moving from the search engine to the retail giant.\n\nA 2018 Google presentation displayed in court Thursday referred to overlapping products it had with the online retailer and listed risks to its business in four areas: retail, queries, ads and cloud computing.\n\n\u201cThey are doing a great job of using their closed loop to attract ad dollars in a way we cannot because we do not have a closed loop,\u201d Raghavan said.\n\nOn cross-examination, a Justice Department lawyer sought to show that there was no evidence that a person shopping more on Amazon meant that they were searching less on Google. He cited Google\u2019s own internal research effort in 2019, called Project Charlotte, that came to that conclusion.\n\n\u201cPeople who end up spending more time on Amazon might also be the same kinds of people who spend more time on Google,\u201d Raghavan testified under questioning from the DOJ lawyer, Joshua Hafenbrack. \u201cOne does not cause the other.\u201d\n\nLater, Hafenbrack asked how much Amazon pays Google for prominent advertising visibility on the search service.\n\n\u201cBillions of dollars,\u201d Raghavan said.\n\n(Updates with additional testimony)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nSam Bankman-Fried Takes Stand in Reminder of Crypto\u2019s Epic Fall X, One Year Later: How Elon Musk Made a Mess of Twitter\u2019s Business Venezuela\u2019s Primary Sweep Puts Maduro and Biden in the Hot Seat No One Understands Corporate Boycotts Like This Former Trump Researcher The War That Broke Social Media\n\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-search-executive-worried-amazon-193411342.html", "symbols": ["ABEA.F", "ABEA.XETRA", "ABEC.F", "ABEC.XETRA", "AMZ.F", "AMZ.XETRA", "AMZN.MX", "AMZN.US", "AMZO34.SA", "GOGL34.SA", "GOGL35.SA", "GOOG.MX", "GOOG.US", "GOOGL.US"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.988, "neg": 0.052, "neu": 0.852, "pos": 0.096}}, {"date": "2023-10-26T21:13:00+00:00", "title": "Amazon earnings blast Street forecasts, but holiday sales outlook muted", "content": "Amazon firmly topped Street earnings forecasts for the third quarter, but its end-of-year revenue forecast may suggest muted consumer spending over the holiday period.\n\nContinue reading", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/m/b9119f36-ff83-361f-a121-57e16f2bb733/amazon-earnings-blast-street.html", "symbols": ["AMZ.F", "AMZ.XETRA", "AMZN.MX", "AMZN.US", "AMZO34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.599, "neg": 0, "neu": 0.83, "pos": 0.17}}, {"date": "2023-10-26T20:46:59+00:00", "title": "Amazon posts strong revenue and profits, says its in 'best position' its ever been ahead of holidays", "content": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Amazon on Thursday reported strong revenue and profits from the summer months driven by growth in online sales and its advertising business.\n\nFor the three months that ended on Sept. 30, the company said it earned $143.1 billion in revenue, a 13% increase compared to the same period last year. Amazon made $9.9 billion in profits, topping analysts' expectations and sending its stocks higher in after-hours trading.\n\nIn a prepared statement, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said the company had a strong quarter as its advertising business grew robustly and it improved its delivery speed.\n\nDeliveries to Amazon's Prime customers have been getting faster under a model where warehouses in eight regions across the country serve smaller areas. On a call with reporters on Thursday, Amazon\u2019s Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said, this year, packages were delivered at the fastest speed ever for U.S. customers.\n\n\u201cWe're ready to make this a great holiday season for customers,\u201d Olsavsky said, adding Amazon's operations network and inventory are in the \u201cbest position\u201d its ever been heading into the holiday season.\n\nOverall, consumers have have shown resilience in their spending despite rising interest rates and stubbornly high inflation that has steadily eased since last year. Amazon said Thursday its retail business grew by 6% during the third quarter. It was boosted by the company\u2019s popular Prime Day sales event held in July. Amazon is also seeing strong customer demand across categories like beauty, health and personal care items, Olsavsky said.\n\n\u201cBut we still see customers being cautious about price, trading down where they can and seeking out deals,\u201d he said.\n\nRevenue from another sales event held earlier this month for Prime members will be included in Amazon\u2019s earnings for the October-December period.\n\nAside from the core e-commerce business, investors have been focused on the slowdown of Amazon Web Services, the company\u2019s profitable cloud computing unit also known as AWS. The unit had propped Amazon\u2019s earnings during a slowdown in online sales in the aftermath of the pandemic. AWS began to see lower rates of growth in the past year as companies cut costs amid high inflation and broader concerns about the economy.\n\nStory continues\n\nJassy said on Thursday that AWS, which grew by 12%, continued to stabilize. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had expected growth of roughly 13%. Meanwhile, Amazon's cloud competitors have delivered mixed results. Earlier this week, Microsoft reported strong revenue for its flagship cloud platform, Azure, while revenue from Google\u2019s Cloud division fell below analysts\u2019 expectations.\n\nInvestors have expressed optimism about AWS and the opportunities it could provide Amazon in the growing AI race. Over the past few months, the company has been rolling out generative AI tools AWS customers can use to make their own applications. It made another aggressive move in September when it announced a $4 billion investment in San Francisco-based Anthropic, an AI startup founded by former staffers from ChatGPT maker OpenAI, which currently has a partnership with Microsoft.\n\nUnder the deal, Anthropic is making AWS its primary cloud computing service and using Amazon\u2019s custom chips to train and deploy its generative AI systems.\n\nAdditionally, Amazon has rolled out an update to its popular voice assistant Alexa with new AI features that make it more human-like. It also unveiled a new generative AI feature that summarizes product reviews for customers.\n\nOn Thursday, Amazon also reported its burgeoning advertising business grew by 25%.\n\nThe report comes as Amazon is facing regulatory scrutiny on several fronts. Last month, the Federal Trade Commission and 17 states filed a landmark lawsuit against the company, alleging the e-commerce giant was abusing its position in the marketplace through anti-competitive practices that boost prices for consumers on and off its platform.\n\nThe agency, led by Big Tech critic Lina Khan, is also challenging the company\u2019s business practices in separate lawsuit that accuses Amazon of duping consumers into enrolling in the Prime subscription program. Amazon denies both claims.\n\nThe company said it expects to earn between $160 billion and $167 billion during the fourth quarter.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-reports-better-expected-revenue-204659146.html", "symbols": ["AMZ.F", "AMZ.XETRA", "AMZN.MX", "AMZN.US", "AMZO34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.996, "neg": 0.037, "neu": 0.827, "pos": 0.136}}, {"date": "2023-10-26T20:44:20+00:00", "title": "Amazon reports robust sales while cloud growth remains steady", "content": "Cost-cutting and a growing advertising business contributed to strong quarterly sales and earnings at ecommerce group Amazon, as it reiterated that growth in its core cloud computing arm was stabilising.

Long a major source of profit, Amazon Web Services (AWS) saw growth slow down in earlier quarters while it is tackling significant costs to meet its AI goals.\n\nAmazon is facing off against Microsoft, the second-largest cloud provider by revenue, which beat Wall Street estimates this week as its customers geared up for AI upgrades.\n\nAndy Jassy, Amazon's chief executive, said in a statement: \"Our AWS growth continued to stabilize.\"\n\nAmazon's revenue in the third quarter rose 13% to $143.1 billion, beating Wall Street estimates of $141.41 billion, according to LSEG data. AWS brought in revenue of $23.1 billion, compared with analysts' expectations of $23.09 billion.\n\nFor the current holiday quarter, the company forecast revenue in the range of $160 billion and $167 billion. However, analysts polled by LSEG were expecting revenue of $166.62 billion, at the higher end of Amazon's guidance.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn retail, Amazon has reorganized its delivery network to locate goods closer to shoppers, letting it fulfill orders faster than before, and more cheaply.\n\nAmazon's same-day delivery services is improving its margins by spurring shoppers to place more frequent and bigger orders. The retailer invested heavily in 2020 and 2021 to make the service available in more places.\n\n\"The retail division is sparking back into life, especially in North America,\" said Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.\n\n\"There's been a significant increase in the number of seasonal workers Amazon's taken on in readiness for the Christmas rush, which bodes well for expectations around discretionary spending.\"\n\nSales in Amazon's North America segment increased 11% to nearly $88 billion, and the company reported a $4.3 billion operating profit in the business compared with an operating loss a year earlier.\n\nChallenges to Amazon's business remain.\n\nThe U.S. Federal Trade Commission in September sued Amazon for allegedly inflating prices and wielding monopoly power, claims that Amazon has disputed. The company has said it will contest the lawsuit.\n\nHousehold budgets have remained tight in the meantime, while cloud customers have undergone a months-long process of scrutinizing their spending.\n\nStill, marketing events have helped prop up sales.\n\nAmazon said a summer shopping blitz known as Prime Day notched its biggest sales day ever, while a follow-up promotion period was its largest October holiday kickoff to date.\n\nAmazon has aimed to operate more leanly in light of recent economic uncertainty. After planning 27,000 layoffs, or what had been 9% of its roughly 300,000-person staff starting last year, it has since revealed more role reductions at Amazon Fresh stores, for instance.\n\nNet income rose to $9.9 billion in the third quarter from $2.87 billion a year earlier.

The AWS team continues to innovate and deliver at a rapid clip, particularly in generative AI, where the combination of our custom AI chips, Amazon Bedrock being the easiest and most flexible way to build and deploy generative AI applications, and our coding companion (CodeWhisperer) allowing enterprises to have the equivalent of an experienced engineer who understands all of their proprietary code is driving momentum with customers, including adidas, Booking.com, GoDaddy, LexisNexis, Merck, Royal Philips, and United Airlines, all of whom are starting to run generative AI workloads on AWS. Between AWS re:Invent and our 29th holiday shopping season, this is a particularly action-packed time of year at Amazon and we\u2019re excited for what\u2019s to come.\"\n\nHighlights\n\nObsessing over the customer experience\n\nAmazon obsesses over how to make customers\u2019 lives better and easier every day with new and improved products and services.

From 2014 through 2022, Amazon\u2019s wind and solar farms helped generate $12.6 billion in investments for communities around the world, and contributed more than $5.4 billion in global gross domestic product (GDP). Amazon now has more than 400 wind and solar projects globally. Announced that the company will require suppliers to share their carbon emissions data with Amazon and set carbon goals beginning in 2024, and that Amazon will provide tools and resources to help suppliers reach their goals.

Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies, and the various factors detailed below.\n\nFourth Quarter 2023 Guidance\n\nNet sales are expected to be between $160.0 billion and $167.0 billion, or to grow between 7% and 12% compared with fourth quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates a favorable impact of approximately 40 basis points from foreign exchange rates. Operating income is expected to be between $7.0 billion and $11.0 billion, compared with $2.7 billion in fourth quarter 2022. This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded.\n\nA conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company\u2019s financial and operating results.\n\nThese forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com\u2019s financial results is included in Amazon.com\u2019s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.\n\nOur investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us.

The market has shown high volatility and put investors in a state where they are only looking to invest in stocks that have already proven themselves and can survive through market turmoil. The best way to do this is to find forever stocks that have strong fundamentals, proven track records and a solid history. This will ensure that they continue to grow, no matter how the market is performing.\n\nThere are some stocks you should buy and hold forever, these are companies that have a strong moat and enjoy consistent growth. Many of them also pay steady dividends, generating passive income for you. They have strong fundamentals and enjoy steady profits. Investing in such stocks will not only bring stability to your portfolio but also improve your finances. With that in mind, let\u2019s take a look at the three stocks to buy and hold forever.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of my favorite tech stocks, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a household name. It caters to individuals and businesses globally and is an integral part of the global software ecosystem. This is one stock to buy and never, ever sell.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMSFT stock is exchanging hands at $330 today, up 37% year to date. It has generated over 200% returns in the past five years and this is one stock that is slowly but steadily moving in the upward direction for the past year.\n\nIn the recent quarter, MSFT saw a 27% rise in its net income which was a result of a cut back on spending. Microsoft\u2019s revenue stood at $56.5 billion, which is up 13% year over year and the EPS came in at $2.29. Interestingly, the revenue from Azure was up 29% and this is one segment that continues to contribute significantly to the revenue. With a global presence, a solid history, and an enviable product, Microsoft is one of the lifetime stocks to own.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company expects 15% revenue growth in the coming quarter with revenue ranging from $60.4 billion to $61.4 billion. Its $13 billion investment in OpenAI has started showing results and the company expects to start making money from the AI features in 2024 when it has more products in the market.\n\nMicrosoft has always been considered as a long-term play and any dip in the stock is a chance to accumulate. Buy MSFT stock and never sell. You will not only enjoy capital gain but also passive income through the dividends. The company boasts of a dividend yield of 0.88% and has recently announced a quarterly dividend of $0.75.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nE-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has gone from an online bookstore to a global giant. However, it wasn\u2019t built overnight. The leaders and management have taken risks and ventured into different areas including entertainment, health, and groceries. The company is currently enjoying the growth of Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nKnown for innovation and unmatched services, Amazon has become a household name and there is no stopping its growth momentum. The company has reported stellar earnings in the past and beat analyst estimates time and again. In the\u00a0second quarter, it saw an 11% rise in net sales to hit $134.4 billion and the net income came in at $6.7 billion. Wall Street is highly optimistic about its upcoming results and expects the company to beat projections. We could see some more AI wins and higher AWS numbers.\n\nThe stock is trading at $119 right now and could move higher once the company announces results today. It is up 41% year to date and can keep moving upwards. Amazon has been using AI for several years now which has helped it offer customized purchase recommendations, helped with logistics and delivery, and also helped expand the business reach. It recently launched a powered image generation feature which is aimed at helping advertisers give a better experience to the customers.\n\nThe company enjoys revenue from its ad business and with the integration of AI, we could see better numbers shortly. Amazon will also report strong fourth-quarter results due to the sales and holiday season. You will not regret buying the stock.\n\nJohnson & Johnson (JNJ) A red Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) sign hangs inside in Moscow, Russia.\n\nSource: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf you want to invest in a stock and forget about it, consider Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), a healthcare giant and a renowned name in the industry, the company is worth spot in your portfolio.\n\nJNJN announced the third quarter results recently and shined all the way. It beat Wall Street estimates and its revenues surpassed expectations. The EPS came in at $2.66 and the revenue stood at $21.35 billion. The sales saw a 6% rise from the prior year period and it also revised the full-year guidance expecting sales between $83.6 billion and $84 billion with an EPS in the range of $10.07 to $10.13.\n\nThe stock has become attractive after the customer health segment was divested into Kenvue. This move will help ensure that the company is making the most of the revenue and growth from the medical devices and pharmaceutical sectors. Now is the right time to invest in the stock. It is down 14% year to date and trading much lower than the 52-week high of $181.\n\nA dividend king, Johnson & Johnson believes in rewarding investors and has increased the dividends for the past 60 years. It enjoys a dividend yield of 3.14% and has announced a quarterly dividend of $1.19. For a stock trading at $151, an annual dividend of $4.76 per share isn\u2019t bad at all. JNJ is a highly reliable company and it can survive any market turmoil. It has products that always remain in demand and even if consumer spending slows, pharmaceutical and healthcare is one segment where people will spend.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Retail sales increased in September once again, which definitely is a good sign ahead of the all-important holiday sales.\n\nThe holiday season, which typically starts on Nov 1 and runs through Dec 24, is expected to see a solid jump in sales, driven by robust e-commerce spending. Given this scenario, investing in retail stocks with a strong online presence like Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, GameStop Corp. GME, Nordstrom, Inc. JWN, Walmart, Inc. WMT and American Eagle Outfitters, Inc. AEO would be ideal.\n\nHoliday Sales Projected to Grow\n\nRetail sales, excluding automobiles are expected to rise 3.7% year over year this time, according to the latest Mastercard SpendingPulse.\n\nWith online shopping turning into a habit for millions of Americans during the peak of the pandemic, consumers are expected to continue shopping through various channels. Online retail sales are projected to jump a robust 6.7% year over year, while in-store sales are expected to increase 2.9%.\n\nA separate report from Adobe Analytics shows that online sales during the holiday season are projected to jump 4.8% year over year.\n\nAlso, sales are anticipated to grow at a faster pace and hit $221.8 billion between Nov 1 and Dec 31, which includes key shopping days like Cyber Monday, Thanksgiving, and Black Friday, compared to $211.7 billion recorded in 2022.\n\nElectronics, gadgets, and gaming products are projected to be at the forefront of consumers' wish lists. Electronics sales are anticipated to rise 6% compared to 2022.\n\nThis comes as the latest report from the Commerce Department showed that retail sales jumped a solid 0.7% month over month in September, totaling $704.9 billion.\n\nCore retail sales, which strips out sales at auto dealers, mobile homes, tobacco stores, and gas stations, rose 0.6% month over month. E-commerce sales rose by 1% in September, following a 0.4% increase in the previous month.\n\nStory continues\n\nSince March 2022, the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates by 525 basis points, taking its benchmark policy rate to the range of 5.25-5.5%. This aggressive rate hike approach has led to a significant reduction in inflation over the past 15 months.\n\nEasing inflation led the Federal Reserve to keep its policy rate unaltered in its September FOMC meeting. Additionally, it has indicated a potential 25 basis point interest rate hike in the future.\n\nMarket participants are optimistic that the Fed might conclude its rate hike campaign after this, which is promising news for the retail and discretionary sectors as the holiday season approaches.\n\nStocks to Watch\n\nGiven the encouraging economic environment and increase in retail sales, it would be prudent for savvy investors to consider betting on retail stocks that stand to benefit directly from these favorable conditions.We have chosen five such stocks.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. is one of the largest e-commerce providers, with sprawling operations in North America and across the globe.

This not only signifies unmatched convenience for consumers but also establishes Walmart as the go-to destination during challenging times, thanks to its commitment to everyday low prices, aiding individuals in stretching their budgets.\n\nJust as essential as its everyday products is Walmart\u2019s dividend history. This retail giant initiated dividend payouts in March 1974 at a rate of 5 cents per share. Today, it stands at a solid forward yield of 1.47%. This represents an 8% annual growth rate sustained for half a century \u2013 remarkable, considering the conditions.\n\nWalmart\u2019s exceptional strength lies in its immense scale, enabling it to secure the best prices from suppliers and deliver value to its customers. While many retailers faltered in competing against Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Walmart successfully rose to the challenge, emerging as a viable e-commerce alternative.\n\nDuring economic downturns, Walmart remains consistently profitable, making recessions something of a specialty. Over the past five decades, the stock has delivered remarkable total returns, amounting to more than 5,000% \u2013 double the performance of the S&P 500.\n\nCaterpillar (CAT) Close up of industrial bricklayer installing bricks on construction site. materials stocks\n\nSource: bogdanhoda / Shutterstock.com\n\nCaterpillar (NYSE:CAT) specializes in construction, mining, and engineering equipment manufacturing.

That represents a small yield, totaling just 1%, but solid considering the painting company\u2019s prospects amid housing market shocks. Management reinforced those prospects in the same report, projecting 24% earnings growth over the next year and marking a 24% payout ratio. That growth and sustainable ratio mean that SHW\u2019s dividend is here to stay.\n\nDespite wide market supply concerns, new residential construction has ticked up in recent months. Paint, of course, is a lynchpin for new construction projects. Where the housing market goes, so too does SHW. But it doesn\u2019t stop there. As more Americans realize the housing market might not be kind to sellers, they focus inward, redecorating and revitalizing their existing homes. That, too, bodes well for SHW as more consumers undergo small-scale renovations during winter months.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) McDonald's restaurant in Thailand.\n\nSource: Tama2u / Shutterstock\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) is a household name for consumers worldwide, but its dividend stock potential makes it a key part of income-focused investing.\n\nFrom a value-oriented standpoint, McDonald\u2019s is a well-established powerhouse with an unrivaled market presence.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at Billionaire David Tepper Doesn't Like Most Stocks But He Likes These 5.\n\nDavid Tepper is one of the most successful and richest hedge fund managers, having mastered the art of skillfully navigating market crises. The Carnegie Mellon graduate founded Appaloosa Management in 1993 with just $57 million after a stint at Goldman Sachs as a credit analyst. While the hedge fund first focused on distressed debt, it has grown in strength with solid bets in public equity and fixed income.\n\nTepper's fund is one of the most followed on Wall Street owing to its impressive track record. It has posted a portfolio gain of 201.56% since 2013 and generated average returns of 19.63% over the past three years. As the global economy was bouncing from the financial crisis in 2009, the hedge fund generated a 30% return in 2010.\n\nWhile managing over\u00a0$14 billion in assets under management, the hedge fund allocates most of its funds to technology stocks, given their solid returns on share price gains, dividends, and buybacks. After technology stocks, the hedge fund also bets big on the services sector, basic materials, and healthcare.\n\nAppaloosa Management LP has always been big on technology stocks as one of the ways of gaining exposure to emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence. Some of the large-cap stocks that account for a big share of the portfolio include Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\nTepper has been one of the most vocal investors about the high-interest rate environment triggered by the need to lower inflationary pressures. Late last year, he echoed his concern that central banks were unlikely to lower interest rates, something that could pose significant challenges to the equity markets.\n\nStory continues Billionaire David Tepper Doesn't Like Most Stocks But He Likes These\n\n\"I would probably say I'm leaning short on the equity markets right now because the upside/downside doesn't make sense to me when I have so many Central banks telling me what they are going to do, what they want to do, what they expect to do,\" Tepper, who runs Appaloosa Management LP, said in an interview on CNBC.\n\nGiven that the Fed has hiked interest rates from nearly zero to north of 5%, there are growing concerns about the potential impact of the high interest rate environment. While such hikes are often expected to curb inflation, they tend to drag down house prices, triggering higher mortgage rates. They also heap pressure on debt-reliant industries like commercial real estate.\n\nEven though Tepper has called out the high-interest rate environment, he maintains investors should expect stocks to command lower valuations than in the past years as financial conditions tighten. With the lower valuations, the hedge fund manager has been building stock positions he believes offer a solid long-term return.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe scanned Appaloosa Management's second quarter portfolio and picked some of its top holdings.\n\nBillionaire David Tepper Doesn't Like Most Stocks But He Likes These\n\n12. Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU)\n\nAppaloosa Management's Q2 2023 Investment: $174.6 million\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 36\n\nBaidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) is a Chinese internet giant that provides an array of services, including search, online marketing services, and online entertainment services. The company makes money by selling display ads promoting search results and managed pages.\n\nBy the end of the current year's second quarter, 36 of the 910 hedge funds part of Insider Monkey\u2019s database had bought a stake in Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU).\n\nHere is what Ariel Global Fund said about Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cBy comparison, after a strong run last quarter, China\u2019s internet search and online community leader,\u00a0Baidu, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:BIDU) declined alongside a correction in Chinese stocks attributed to weak gross domestic product. We believe this price action runs counter to the company\u2019s solid business fundamentals. Baidu delivered a top- and bottom-line earnings beat in the period, driven by a recovery in ad and cloud revenues. The company continues to invest heavily in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and is launching a generative AI, Ernie Bot, aimed at rivaling Open AI\u2019s ChatGPT. While monetization of the new technology is largely dependent on regulatory review, we think Baidu should continue to experience margin improvement with the ongoing implementation of efficiency and profitability initiatives. While some investors remain on the sidelines due to uncertainty surrounding China\u2019s economic growth, government regulations, and the political rhetoric towards Taiwan, we remain enthusiastic about Baidu\u2019s longer-term opportunity for revenue growth and margin expansion across internet search, cloud, autonomous driving, artificial intelligence and online video.\u201d\n\n11. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM)\n\nValue of Appaloosa Management LP\u2019s 13F Position: $179.13 million\n\nNumberof Hedge Fund Shareholders: 121\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is one of the biggest semiconductor companies in the world, renowned for manufacturing, packing, and selling integrated circuits and other semiconductor devices.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) attracted more hedge fund interest in the second quarter of 2023, as per Insider Monkey's survey of 910 hedge funds. The survey revealed that the number of hedge funds that owned the firm's shares rose from 102 to 121 in that period. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM)\u2019s largest hedge fund investor is Jean-Marie Eveillard\u2019s\u00a0First Eagle Investment Management since it owns 9.06 million shares that are worth $914.18 million.\n\nBaron Funds made the following comment about about Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cSemiconductor giant\u00a0Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited\u00a0(NYSE:TSM) contributed in the first quarter due to easing geopolitical concerns and expectations for end-demand recovery later in 2023. We retain conviction that Taiwan Semi\u2019s technological leadership; pricing power; and exposure to secular growth markets, including high-performance computing, automotive, 5G, and IoT; will allow the company to sustain strong earnings growth over the next several years.\u201d\n\n10. QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM)\n\nValue of Appaloosa Management LP\u2019s13F Position: $220.22 million\n\nNumber of Hedge FundShareholders: 73\n\nAppaloosa Management owns a $220.2 million stake in QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM).\n\nThe firm's shares were held by 73 hedge funds in the second quarter of 2023, according to Insider Monkey's study of 910 hedge funds. This was an increase from 69 hedge funds that owned the firm's shares in the previous quarter.\n\nIn its Q2 2023 letter to investors, ClearBridge Investments said this about QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM):\n\n\"In the technology sector, in addition to exiting Cisco Systems, we also sold out of our marginal position in QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM), whose business is tied to wireless handsets. With the 5G cycle largely played out and competitive risks in the wireless component space rising, we see less upside for Qualcomm relative to earlier in the cycle.\"\n\n9. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)\n\nValueof Appaloosa Management LP\u2019s 13FPosition: $226.56 million\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 71\n\nIntel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) has carved a niche in designing, developing, and selling computing and related products. Its product line includes central processing units and chipsets, system-on-chip, and multichip packages. It also makes connectivity products, memory, and storage products.\n\nAppaloosa Management held stakes worth $226 million in Intel as of the end of the second quarter.\n\nThis is what ClearBridge Investments wrote about Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)\u00a0in its Q4 2022 investor letter:\n\n\u201cA third approach to return generation is purchasing idiosyncratic businesses that largely control their own destiny.\u00a0Intel Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:INTC), which we purchased in the first quarter on the premise that it would develop a leading domestic foundry business, has struggled with execution missteps and product delays. We are maintaining the position to provide ongoing exposure to semiconductors.\u201d\n\n8. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nValue of Appaloosa Management LP\u2019s 13F Position: $263.13 million\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 112\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a chip giant operating in four segments: Data Centre, Client Gaming, and Embedded. The company offers x86 microprocessors and graphics processing units (GPUs) as an accelerated processing units, chipsets, data center, and professional GPUs, and embedded processors.\n\nAppaloosa Management turned to Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) to gain exposure to the AI frenzy with a $263 million stake.\n\nArtisan Partners shared its thoughts on Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cAmong our top contributors were\u00a0Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMD), NU Holdings and Netflix. AMD\u2019s data center CPUs are used in the cloud service provider (CSP) servers. In addition to the broader secular tailwind from cloud adoption, the company has a performance and pricing advantage over Intel, which we believe will enable it to continue capturing market share. However, the recent stock price rally was due to growing excitement around the company\u2019s AI exposure. It will launch its new MI300 graphics processing unit (GPU) chip later this year to compete against the dominant market leader NVIDIA. Similar to its approach that won market share from Intel within the CPU market, AMD\u2019s product will aim to provide similar performance at a more attractive price. AMD is already working with Microsoft and Meta, while Amazon publicly stated that it is evaluating AMD\u2019s inferencing chips. Using assumptions around the total GPU market size, potential market share gains and price points, our research indicates this could be a $20 billion opportunity for AMD. That would nearly double its revenue. While the company has not historically missed many deadlines, there is execution risk as it works to manufacture and distribute these complex chips at scale, which, combined with an elevated valuation after the stock\u2019s strong performance run, led us to trim the position.\u201d\n\n7. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nValue of Appaloosa Management LP\u2019s 13FPosition: $279.44 million\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 152\n\nHeadquartered in Mountain View, California, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is an internet behemoth that offers various services under the Google Services, Google Cloud, and other Bets segments. Appaloosa Management has always held stakes in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) since 2015. The fund's stake stood at $279.44 million as of the second quarter, accounting for 5.18% of the portfolio.\n\nHere is what Artisan Partners said about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cOur best performing stocks this quarter were Meta,\u00a0Alphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG) and Heidelberg Materials. The rise in Alphabet\u2019s share performance was primarily driven by the AI frenzy. Earlier this year, there were some doubts about Alphabet\u2019s ability to compete with OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT product. This was a bit ironic since Alphabet has been using AI technology to improve its Google search results and advertising business for years. Indeed, the technology that underpins OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT actually came from Alphabet more than five years ago. But sometimes the market needs a reminder, and Alphabet provided tangible evidence of its capabilities. At a recent developer conference, it launched Bard, a consumer-oriented generative AI version of its search engine, as well as several other concrete examples of how AI could improve its current business. As with Meta, the long-term implications of AI on Alphabet\u2019s business model are still far from certain. But we do believe that it is a technology leader in this field and will participate in whatever direction the technology develops.\u201d\n\n6. Uber Technologies, Inc.

(NYSE:UBER) has found its footing after coming under immense pressure in 2022. The stock is already up by more than 60% year to date. The rally comes on the expectation that the company is moving closer to its\u00a0target of breakeven after years of losses. Expectations are high that the company will post a full-year profit in 2023 and grow 50% on average after that.\n\nUber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER)\u2019s strong growth prospects explain why Appaloosa Management holds a stake worth $308.67 million, accounting\u00a0for 5.72% of its portfolio.\n\nInsider Monkey scouted 910 hedge fund portfolios for 2023\u2019s second quarter to discover that 144 had invested in Uber Technologies, Inc.

Unilever's previous strategy updates promising greater agility, productivity and innovation ultimately didn't really deliver. This Action Plan feels like it has more substance, but the proof will be in the pudding.\"\n\nUnilever also named a new chief financial officer and replaced division heads as Schumacher seeks to revive the company, focusing investment on its top 30 brands.\n\nIntel (INTC)\n\nIntel stock has continued its decline this week after a report that Nvidia (NVDA) was developing an Arm-based CPU for the PC market.\n\nIt is set to report its third quarter earnings after the closing bell on Thursday, with an expectation of $13.5bn revenue in the quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nThis is an 11.7% decline compared to the $15.3bn the company reported in the same period last year. Wall Street is anticipating adjusted earnings per share of $0.21, down 64.2% year-on-year.\n\nIntel\u2019s Client Computing revenue is expected to hit $7.4bn in Q3, a decline of 9.2% year over year.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out\u00a0Duquesne Family Office's 5 New Stock Picks.\n\nAn imminent collapse and recession was the sentiment echoed by billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller late last year in response to an aggressive\u00a0monetary policy tightening. The legendary investor affirmed that it would be a surprise if the economy did not plunge into recession. While nothing has materialized, the legendary investor's thoughts are starting to hold water as the effects of high interest rates begin to be felt amid escalating geopolitical tensions.\n\nThe legendary investor maintains that quantitative easing that has gone on for almost a decade has created more troubles whose effects are starting to be felt. According to Druckenmiller, Federal Reserve policymakers have put themselves, the country and, most importantly, the people, in a terrible position. The billionaire investor insists controlling inflation is not about raising interest rates.\n\nEarly in the year, the legendary investor was aggressive in shorting stocks in anticipation of market turmoil amid the recession concerns. His portfolio was\u00a0short 20%, signaling he expected the market to turn bearish amid the aggressive quantitative easing. His skepticism was further exacerbated as regional banks started to waver, with the SVB collapse all but rattling the overall market. Despite the market's skepticism, Druckenmiller remained bullish in some plays, mainly focusing on growth companies with solid long-term prospects.\n\nAs one of the most successful investors on Wall Street, Druckenmiller's sentiments often reverberate far and wide in the investment community. Billed as one of the wealthiest people in the world with a net worth of more than $6 billion, he is often followed for guidance and insights on the direction the overall market is likely to move.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe former hedge fund manager has years of experience, having started working in the finance industry in the late 1970s. Having previously worked for\u00a0George Soros of Soros Fund Management, he formed his hedge fund, Duquesne Capital Management. Druckenmiller made a name for himself, having a successful bet against the British Pound, and made millions of dollars in profit in partnership with Soros.\n\nAfter parting ways with Soros at the height of the Dotcom bubble, he started managing his hedge fund, managing billions of dollars in capital. Nevertheless, it would not last long, as the legendary investor shut down the hedge fund from outside capital, having become disgruntled with managing billions of dollars of people's money.\n\nNowadays, Druckenmiller manages capital through the Duquesne Family Office and deals with a few clients. The investment arm mainly deploys a diversified investment strategy focusing on various industries, from technology to financial services and consumer discretionary. Duquesne Family Office's 15 New Stock Picks\n\nStanley Druckenmiller of Duquesne Capital\n\nIn addition to betting on large-cap companies, Druckenmiller also invests in small-cap companies with a market cap of less than $5 billion. Consequently, the billionaire investor generates massive profits through small share price appreciation. Some of billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller's top stock picks in the small-cap space include Recursion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:RXRX), Tornado Realty Trust (NYSE:VNO), and Wary Parker Inc. (NYSE:WRBY). The investment strategy also allows the investor to gain exposure to companies before they boom in the stock market.\n\nWhile Druckenmiller has been pessimistic for the better part of the year, he has bought many stocks, adding to his portfolio. He ramped up stakes in big tech companies in the first quarter alone, including Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Taiwan Semiconductor, and Marvell Technology Inc. Some of Druckenmiller's top stock picks were focused on the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nDruckenmiller has echoed his expectations of artificial intelligence being impactful in almost all aspects of life, as is the case with the internet. In addition to betting big on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) to gain exposure to AI innovations, he also bought stakes in IQVIA Holdings, a healthcare company that boasts AI capabilities.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe have compiled a list of some of the billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller's new stock picks. We took a look at his 13-F portfolio for the second quarter of this year and narrowed down the 15 latest stock picks.

He leverages puts and call options to pursue high-risk market reward opportunities. In the options market, the legendary investor mainly focuses on exchange-traded funds, given their diversified portfolios. Hedge Fund Manager Louis Bacon's Top 12 Stock Picks\n\nLouis Bacon Moore of Moore Capital\n\nFor instance, Bacon has exposure to the\u00a0iShares 7 to 10-year ETF  that seeks to track the investment results of an index that comprises US treasury bonds. While leveraging the Call option, the hedge fund manager tries to profit from the ETF price increasing over a defined period until expiry. Likewise, the strategy allows the hedge fund manager to benefit from rising treasury and bond prices.\n\nMoore Capital Management has also taken a Put option on the\u00a0Spdr S & P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) ETF.

The Windows software maker rode its Azure cloud-services business to a 3.1% gain on Wednesday, while Google\u2019s parent suffered its biggest stock drop in more than three years after cloud sales marred otherwise strong results. Amazon sank 5.6% in a broad tech rout ahead of its earnings due on Thursday afternoon.\n\nThe divergence shows how central cloud computing has become for the tech behemoths following a rally this year that stretched valuations, contributing to an environment where any disappointments are being punished severely.\n\n\u201cI am a bit more nervous about Amazon now,\u201d said Dan Eye, chief investment officer at Fort Pitt Capital Group. \u201cGiven where tech valuations are, you have to be selective. I\u2019ve always been a bit cautious on Amazon since it runs such thin margins, and it seems fair to think that if it is also seeing some weakness with its cloud, that that will really show up in its operating margins.\u201d\n\nWhen Amazon reports third-quarter results, Amazon Web Services sales are expected to have expanded 12% to about $23 billion from the same period a year ago, according to the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Overall, Amazon is projected to deliver earnings per share of 58 cents on revenue of $142 billion, respective increases of 236% and 11%.\n\nCompared with Alphabet, the stakes in cloud computing are even higher for Amazon, which relied on AWS for about 17% of sales and nearly three-fourths of its $7.7 billion in operating profit in the second quarter. By contrast, Google Cloud accounts for just 11% of Alphabet\u2019s sales and the unit became profitable for the first time this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon shares have rallied 45% this year, adding almost $400 billion in market value, as cost-cutting efforts have helped boost profits. But it\u2019s come under pressure in recent weeks as traders have soured on more expensive growth stocks amid soaring US Treasury yields and geopolitical strife. Amazon\u2019s price relative to projected earnings has come down, but at about 32 times it still trades at a big premium to the Nasdaq 100 at 22 times.\n\nDespite the stock\u2019s selloff on Wednesday, Timothy Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist at Ingalls & Snyder, expects Amazon to deliver results more in line with Microsoft than Alphabet.\n\n\u201cMicrosoft\u2019s report speaks well for Amazon because both saw a slowing in cloud growth around the same time, so this suggests Amazon will also see a re-acceleration,\u201d said Ghriskey. \u201cThat\u2019s obviously very positive, especially since cloud is such a profitable business.\u201d\n\nConsumer spending has also held up better than expected, a potential tailwind for Amazon\u2019s e-commerce business, according to Bill Stone, chief investment officer at the Glenview Trust Co. Amazon\u2019s latest Prime Day event in October lifted shares and yielded positive comments from analysts.\n\nAnd, though Alphabet\u2019s cloud revenue fell short, search advertising brought in more than analysts expected. That should bode well for Amazon\u2019s own ad business.\n\nUltimately, the recent weakness in Amazon shares around earnings could provide a good buying opportunity, according to analysts at Baird and Evercore ISI.\n\n\u201cWe particularly like the risk-reward heading into the Q3 EPS print, given reasonably low expectations,\u201d Evercore ISI\u2019s Mark Mahaney wrote in a note, reiterating that Amazon is a top pick in the internet sector.\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nAlphabet tumbled 9.5% on Wednesday, erasing about $180 billion from the Google parent\u2019s market value, after the company\u2019s cloud unit reported a smaller-than-expected profit. The loss was the biggest single-session market value wipeout for the search giant and the fourth-largest market value destruction ever among S&P 500 companies.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nApple Inc. is planning an end-to-end overhaul of its AirPods lineup, refreshing a product category that\u2019s emerged as one of the company\u2019s biggest sellers. Meta Platforms Inc. dashed investors\u2019 hopes for a long-term advertising recovery, saying it was at the whim of an uncertain economic environment, even as the company plans to spend heavily on newer businesses including virtual reality and artificial intelligence. Shares fell in extended trading. The digital ad market is finally recovering from a painful slump, but investors remain worried that an economic downturn will send the industry back into a tailspin. SK Hynix Inc. reported a larger-than-expected loss despite moderating revenue declines, suggesting an uneven recovery for the global memory chip market. Shares tumbled the most in a year. STMicroelectronics NV forecast revenue in the fourth quarter below analyst expectations amid a semiconductor industry slump, as Chief Executive Officer Jean-Marc Chery said consumer electronics could start to recover soon.\n\nEarnings Due Thursday\n\nPremarket\n\nComcast Seagate Mobileye OSI Systems CTS Millicom Postmarket\n\nAmazon Intel VeriSign Enphase Juniper Appfolio SPS Commerce Rogers\n\n--With assistance from Tom Contiliano and Subrat Patnaik.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nX, One Year Later: How Elon Musk Made a Mess of Twitter\u2019s Business Sam Bankman-Fried Takes Stand in Reminder of Crypto\u2019s Epic Fall Venezuela\u2019s Primary Sweep Puts Maduro and Biden in the Hot Seat No One Understands Corporate Boycotts Like This Former Trump Researcher The War That Broke Social Media\n\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-400-billion-rally-hinges-095121748.html", "symbols": ["ABEA.F", "ABEA.XETRA", "ABEC.F", "ABEC.XETRA", "AMZ.F", "AMZ.XETRA", "AMZN.MX", "AMZN.US", "AMZO34.SA", "GOGL34.SA", "GOGL35.SA", "GOOG.MX", "GOOG.US", "GOOGL.US", "MSF.F", "MSF.XETRA", "MSFT.MX", "MSFT.US", "MSFT34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.994, "neg": 0.069, "neu": 0.804, "pos": 0.127}}, {"date": "2023-10-26T09:35:00+00:00", "title": "3 Reasons To Buy Alphabet Stock, and 3 Reasons to Sell", "content": "Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) stock price dropped 6% during after-hours trading on Oct. 24 following its third-quarter report.

The European Central Bank is expected to halt its rate-hiking cycle, while investors will also focus on the latest quarterly U.S. growth numbers ahead of next week's Federal Reserve meeting.\n\n1. Meta Platforms falls on revenue guidance; Amazon next up\n\nIt was the turn of Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) to take the spotlight after the close of trading on Wednesday, as the Facebook and Instagram owner beat expectations for third-quarter profit and revenue, helped by an austerity drive and a recovery in digital advertising ahead of the holiday season.\n\nMeta's operating margin in the third quarter doubled to 40%, while revenue grew at its quickest pace in two years.\n\nAdditionally, CEO Mark Zuckerberg stated that Meta is now moving into artificial technology, following the lead of rivals Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), adding AI would constitute Meta's biggest investment area in 2024.\n\nHowever, Meta\u2019s stock fell over 3% premarket as investors fretted over the company\u2019s guidance for the fourth quarter revenue, with the $38.3 billion estimate coming in 1.6% below expectations.\n\nEarnings from the important tech sector continue Thursday, with e-commerce and cloud computing giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) expected to report earnings per share of 58 cents on revenue of $141.5 billion, after the close.\n\nInvestors will look for signs that Amazon's aggressive expansion of same-day delivery services helped increase its third-quarter profit margin by spurring shoppers to place more frequent and bigger orders.\n\n2. Futures fall as the earnings season continues\n\nU.S. stock futures dropped Thursday, continuing the previous session\u2019s selloff with earnings from a series of tech giants driving sentiment.\n\nAt 04:40 ET (08:40 GMT), the Dow futures contract dropped 115 points or 0.3%, S&P 500 futures fell by 26 points or 0.6%, and Nasdaq 100 futures slipped by 140 points or 1%.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe major indices closed sharply lower Wednesday, as Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) miss on revenue expectations from its cloud operations hit the tech sector, in particular, very hard.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 2.4%, recording its worst day since February, while the broad-based S&P 500 dropped 1.4% and the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3%.\n\nThe earnings deluge continues Thursday, with results due from e-commerce giant Amazon the highlight [see above].\n\nNumbers are also due from the likes of pharmaceutical giant Merck (NYSE:MRK), carrier Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), auto giant Ford (NYSE:F) and Mexican fast food chain Chipotle (NYSE:CMG).\n\nThere are a number of economic indicators due Thursday, headlined by the first reading of third quarter gross domestic product [see below].\n\nSeptember durable goods orders, goods trade deficit, wholesale and retail inventory numbers and weekly initial jobless claims will be published at the same time as the GDP report.\n\n3. ECB to pause lengthy hiking streak\n\nThe European Central Bank meets later Thursday, and is widely expected to pause its rate-hiking cycle after raising interest rates at its past 10 meetings.\n\nThe central bank hiked its key interest rates by 25 basis points, taking the deposit rate to 4.00% and the refinancing rate to 4.50%, but signaled its 14-month-long hiking streak was likely to be its last.\n\nA weakening eurozone economy suggests the need for further tightening is limited, with Germany, Europe's largest economy, likely entering a recession this quarter.\n\nHowever, inflation, while slowing, remains above the ECB\u2019s medium-term target. Additionally, the conflict in the Middle East is pushing energy prices higher, creating another headwind.\n\n\"The biggest challenge will be to keep a balancing act -- not sound aggressively hawkish but keep the door open to rate hikes,\" said ING's global head of macro Carsten Brzeski.\n\n4. U.S. GDP seen rising strongly\n\nThe Federal Reserve policymakers get together next week, and they will have fresh data to consider, including the first reading of third quarter gross domestic product, due out later in the session.\n\nGDP is expected to have increased at a 4.3% annualized rate in the last quarter, which would be the fastest since the fourth quarter of 2021, and far sharper than the 2.1% pace seen in the April-June quarter.\n\nThis expected lift in growth will likely come from a boost in consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, which has been supported by a strong labor market.\n\nHowever, the Fed is likely to keep interest rates unchanged at its Oct. 31-Nov. 1 policy meeting, even with a strong GDP number, as financial conditions have already tightened with U.S. Treasury yields surging.\n\n5. Crude slips lower as U.S. inventories rise\n\nCrude prices edged lower Thursday, giving up some of the previous session\u2019s gains as U.S. oil stocks rose while traders continued to focus on developments in the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nBy 04:40 ET, the U.S. crude futures traded 0.7% lower at $84.72 a barrel, while the Brent contract dropped 0.6% to $89.56 a barrel.\n\nThe benchmark contracts settled nearly 2% higher on Wednesday, but have since fallen back after the Wall Street Journal reported that Israel has agreed to delay an expected invasion of Gaza for now.\n\nU.S. crude inventories climbed by 1.4 million barrels last week, according to data from the Energy Information Administration, released Wednesday, pointing to weakening demand at the world\u2019s largest consumer.\n\nHowever, trading remains volatile, as traders struggle to gauge whether the war would escalate and disrupt crude supplies in the oil-rich Middle East region.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAmazon, U.S. GDP, ECB rate decision - what's moving markets\n\nWith House speaker installed, US Congress returns to spending battles\n\nExclusive-TikTok, YouTube, Meta eye Indonesia e-commerce licenses- sources", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-u-gdp-ecb-rate-043447614.html", "symbols": ["AMZ.F", "AMZ.XETRA", "AMZN.MX", "AMZN.US", "AMZO34.SA", "CMG.US", "DJI.INDX", "F.US", "FB2A.F", "FB2A.XETRA", "GOOG.US", "GOOGL.US", "IXIC.INDX", "LUV.US", "META.US", "MRK.US", "MSFT.US"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": -0.968, "neg": 0.088, "neu": 0.832, "pos": 0.08}}, {"date": "2023-10-26T00:00:00+00:00", "title": "3 Stocks to Buy (and Never Ever Sell)", "content": "You will not regret investing in these three forever stocks that will continue to generate passive income for you.", "link": "https://investorplace.com/2023/10/3-stocks-to-buy-and-never-ever-sell/", "symbols": ["AMZN.US", "JNJ.US", "MSFT.US"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.324, "neg": 0, "neu": 0.836, "pos": 0.164}}, {"date": "2023-10-26T00:00:00+00:00", "title": "Amazon\u2019s News Pharmacy Perks Are a Game-Changer for AMZN Stock", "content": "Expectations are extremely bullish as e-commerce giant Amazon prepares to issues its latest earnings on Oct. 26.

With a few rare exceptions, overseas markets have trailed United States. indices for more than 25 years now. Also, market regulations and reporting requirements are lax in many foreign jurisdictions. Corporate fraud can run rampant in many regions of the world. Earnings statements and financial reports are often not worth the paper on which they\u2019re printed. Additionally, many markets and economies are heavily regulated and controlled by governments, making corporate progress difficult. These factors often conspire to make it difficult for investors to realize healthy returns when investing outside of the U.S.\n\nThat said, there are some good stocks of foreign firms out there for investors willing to search and do some due diligence. Diamonds can be found in any place if people are willing to dig. Here are the three best international stocks to buy in 2023.\n\nBaidu (BIDU) Laptop computer displaying logo of Baidu (BIDU), a Chinese multinational technology company specializing in Internet-related services and products\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock.com\n\nTo China, where we have leading technology firm Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU). Currently, Baidu is regarded as China\u2019s leading artificial intelligence (AI) company. Baidu just announced that it has developed a generative AI system that matches the technology used in the ChatGPT and GPT-4 chatbots. Until now, the AI systems developed in China have paled in comparison to those produced by U.S. firms such as OpenAI. However, that could be about to change with the new technology that Baidu claims to have developed and is now making available to companies on a limited basis.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBaidu Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Robin Li said at a public presentation that the company\u2019s newly released ERNIE 4.0 chatbot is \u201con par with GPT-4 in terms of overall performance.\u201d Earlier iterations of Baidu\u2019s ERNIE chatbot were ranked as the best among China\u2019s technology companies based on their algorithms and ecosystems. The new AI developed by Baidu has occurred despite strict government controls on the development of artificial intelligence within China. And Baidu isn\u2019t the only Chinese company racing ahead with AI. Other companies, such as Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), are also creating advanced AI technologies. BIDU stock has increased 35% throughout the last 12 months.\n\nStory continues\n\nBirkenstock (BIRK) Birkenstock (BIRK) is a German producer of foot wear established in 1774.\n\nSource: ArDanMe / Shutterstock.com\n\nIts initial public offering (IPO) didn\u2019t go as hoped, but there\u2019s still reason to like German sandal maker Birkenstock (NYSE:BIRK). The IPO was a dud, with BIRK stock falling 13% on its first trading day on the New York big board. The shares began trading at $41, down 11% from the IPO price of $46 per share. By the end of the first trading day, the stock was down 13% at $40.20. The closing price on the first day of trading gave Birkenstock a market value of $7.55 billion. While disappointing, the poor performance of the IPO was mostly due to bad timing rather than anything fundamentally wrong with Birkenstock.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that Birkenstock has been a going concern since 1774, and has made its world famous sandals for that entire time. The company also looks to have a strong balance sheet, reporting in its IPO prospectus that its revenue grew from $770 million in fiscal 2020 to $1.3 billion in fiscal 2022. Net profits at Birkenstock have risen by $91 million throughout the last two fiscal years. Since its IPO, BIRK stock has stabilized and is now trading at $38 per share. It will take some time for the company to report financial results and win the trust of investors, but Birkenstock has potential. This easily earns its spot on our list of the best international stocks to buy.\n\nMercado Libre (MELI) MercadoLibre (MELI) homepage on a smartphone\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nNow to Argentina where we have e-commerce giant MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI). South America\u2019s answer to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been on a big tear lately. MELI stock is up 43% year to date and has gained 300% throughout the last five years. The big moves in the share price reflect the company\u2019s strong growth trajectory. In 2022, MercadoLibre\u2019s revenue grew 49% from a year earlier to $10.5 billion. Its full-year profit increased nearly 500% to $482 million from $83 million in 2021. Now that the company has turned profitable, its profits are accelerating at breakneck speed.\n\nAdditionally, MercadoLibre has a popular online payments system called Mercado Pago that is also growing fast, with payment volumes up 60% year-over-year in 2022. Of course, the big rise in the share price has left MELI stock with a sky high valuation. The company\u2019s stock currently trades at a price-earnings (P/E) ratio of 79, which is expensive even for a fast growing tech company. The share price itself isn\u2019t cheap at nearly $1,200 for one share. However, for investors who prize growth over all else, it might be worth it to pay the premium required to take a position in MELI stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole\u00a0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nJoel Baglole has been a business journalist for 20 years.

As share prices drop, some stocks that are usually expensive stocks become much cheaper. Opportunistic investors who buy now are likely to be rewarded over the long term once markets recover and a broad-based rally takes hold. It\u2019s also important to remember the current slump in equities that took hold in August is largely due to near-term expectations around interest rates and the fact that the U.S. Federal Reserve isn\u2019t likely to start lowering rates until the middle of 2024 \u2014 at the earliest. Geopolitical uncertainties with wars now raging in the Middle East and Europe aren\u2019t helping either. But once interest rates lower, stocks should rise sharply and many well-known growth stocks should resume their upward trajectory. Here are three growth stocks that will make you rich in 20 years.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nE-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) looks to be back on track after reducing its headcount and scaling back its operations coming out of the pandemic. However, the real reason to buy and hold AMZN stock is that the company is so much more today than a company that sells items over the internet and deliveries them to homes and businesses. It was recently announced that Amazon plans to invest $4 billion in artificial intelligence (AI) start-up company Anthropic, which is a rival to ChatGPT creator OpenAI. Going forward, Amazon said its cloud customers will be given access to Anthropic\u2019s technology through its Bedrock AI platform for businesses.\n\nThe Anthropic investment is the latest example of how Amazon is diversifying its business and moving into new areas. From cloud computing to streaming live NFL football games, to selling groceries through Whole Foods and developing cutting edge drones to deliver packages and humanoid robots to work in its e-commerce fulfillment centers, Amazon is an increasingly diverse technology concern. While AMZN stock was driven lower during last year\u2019s tech wreck, the share price is now on the comeback trail, having gained 50% so far in 2023. Over the long-term, the stock can be expected to continue providing value to shareholders.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla cars\n\nA huge buy-the-dip opportunity is forming with electric vehicle maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) after the company\u2019s stock fell 15% following its third-quarter financial report. Any further slide in TSLA stock should be seen as a chance to buy the stock on the cheap, especially if the share price falls below $200. To be sure, Tesla faces a number of short-term challenges that have hurt its earnings and are weighing on the stock. These include a slowing global economy, declining consumer spending on big-ticket items and rising competition from traditional automakers.\n\nHowever, long-term it would be foolish to bet against Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Many people who shorted TSLA stock in recent years have publicly said they came to regret the decision. Also, like Amazon, Tesla is diversifying and becoming a more wide-ranging tech company. Moving beyond its traditional focus on electric vehicles and the batteries that power them, Tesla is pushing into new areas such as solar panels and is even now developing a new supercomputer called Dojo created to train AI systems on large language learning models.\n\nInvestment bank Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) issued a note to clients in September stating the Dojo supercomputer could boost Tesla\u2019s market valuation by as much as $500 billion in the coming years. Investors who buy and hold TSLA stock over the long term should be rewarded.\n\nFerrari (RACE) A close-up of the Ferrari logo on a red car with drops of water\n\nSource: Konstantin Egorychev / Shutterstock.com\n\nLuxury sports car maker Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) is literally racing ahead of other automakers when it comes to share price performance. RACE stock has gained 40% so far this year, is up 53% over the last 12 months and has risen 160% through five years. At the same time, most other automakers\u2019 stocks have fallen into the red. Ferrari owes its success to the fact that it offers a niche product to an elite clientele. Each year, Ferrari produces only about 8,500 vehicles compared to 8.60 million made by Toyota Motor (NYSE:TM).\n\nHowever, the starting price of a Ferrari is more than $200,000 versus about $20,000 for a Toyota sedan. Ferrari operates in an extremely lucrative, high-margin business and has far fewer competitors than most other automakers, providing it with a wide moat around its business. Ferrari is also innovative and constantly trying new things. Recently, the company said it will now accept cryptocurrencies as payment for its cars within the United States. Going forward, Ferrari will accept payment in Bitcoin (BTC-USD), Ethereum (ETH-USD) and USDC \u2014 one of the largest stablecoins. The company says it is simply responding to the demands of its ultra-wealthy customers.\n\nRACE stock shows no signs of slowing down and is unlikely to be disrupted in the same way as traditional automakers.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The retailer invested heavily in 2020 and 2021 in logistics to make same-day delivery, which it introduced in 2015, available in more places.\n\nWhen Amazon reports earnings on Thursday, investors and analysts anticipate gross profit margins will rise 2.67% from last year to 47.37%, according to LSEG.\n\nFast delivery \"drives more frequency to Amazon's website,\" CFRA analyst Arun Sundaram said.\n\n\"It drives larger basket sizes for Amazon. Now that Amazon is introducing a lot more everyday essential items, people are finding it very convenient to go on Amazon and buy things like paper towels, food or packaged goods,\" he said.\n\nAmazon packs its same-day delivery centers with its top 100,000 products. The company in April said it completed a reorganization of its fulfillment network, dividing the U.S. into eight regions to shorten delivery distances and get merchandise to shoppers faster.\n\n\"What we find is when we open up same-day (delivery), you generally see customer engagement go up and purchasing go up,\" Sarah Mathew, vice president of global delivery experience at Amazon, told Reuters in a recent interview. \"But the lift of how much it goes up varies from product to product.\"\n\nThe company will continue to build fulfillment centers, expanding same-day service, Mathew said.\n\nSame-day delivery also boosts Amazon.com's website traffic. This positions the retailer to bring in more advertising revenue, which has grown at least 20% each quarter this year compared to 2022.\n\nColumbia Threadneedle Investments analyst Mari Shor said Amazon and its top competitor, Walmart.com, have become go-to destinations for online shopping because of their investments in fulfillment centers, warehousing and speedy deliveries.\n\nStory continues\n\nSundaram said that same-day and one-day delivery is key to e-commerce growth, which along with advertising revenue will improve Amazon's margins over the next three to five years.\n\nScott Devitt, an analyst at Wedbush, said that he expects Amazon's fast delivery will help it maintain or grow its market share as well as fend off newer e-commerce players such as Shein, PDD Group's Temu and ByteDance's TikTok Shop.\n\n\"Next-day and same-day (delivery) is going to be much more beneficial to Amazon's volume growth than any degradation that we see from Temu,\" Devitt said.\n\nAnalysts expected Amazon's North American retail business to show $85.9 billion in third-quarter revenue, up 9% compared to last year, according to a LSEG estimate.\n\nBy comparison, analysts forecast Walmart will show a 1% decline in e-commerce revenue for the third quarter when it reports in November.\n\n(Reporting by Arriana McLymore in New York; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)", "link": "https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-analysts-expect-same-day-191418718.html", "symbols": ["AMZ.F", "AMZ.XETRA", "AMZN.MX", "AMZN.US", "AMZO34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.988, "neg": 0.019, "neu": 0.875, "pos": 0.106}}, {"date": "2023-10-25T18:50:04+00:00", "title": "Dow futures slip, Meta falls 2.8% after earnings", "content": "Investing.com - US stock futures were trading lower during Wednesday's evening deals, as major US indices continued to sell off throughout the regular session amid a slew of corporate earnings results.\n\nBy 6:30 pm ET (10:30 pm GMT) Dow Jones Futures lost 0.1%, S&P 500 Futures dipped 0.4% and Nasdaq 100 Futures fell 0.8%.\n\nStay ahead of the curve this earnings season with InvestingPro!\n\nIn extended deals, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) lost 2.8% after the company reported Q3 EPS of $4.39 versus $3.64 expected.

This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates, which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.\n\nThe Zacks rating relies solely on a company's changing earnings picture. It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell-side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure -- the Zacks Consensus Estimate.\n\nSince a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near-term stock price movements, the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors. They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.\n\nAs such, the Zacks rating upgrade for Amazon is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price.\n\nMost Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices\n\nThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock.\n\nFundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Amazon imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher.\n\nHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nAs empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions for Amazon\n\nThis online retailer is expected to earn $2.24 per share for the fiscal year ending December 2023, which represents a year-over-year change of 215.5%.\n\nAnalysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Amazon. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 44.5%.\n\nBottom Line\n\nUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.\n\nYou can learn more about the Zacks Rank here >>>\n\nThe upgrade of Amazon to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

While Alphabet's cloud revenue rose in the quarter, it didn't rise as much as analysts had forecast as the parent of Google continues to build out its AI capabilities to compete with other cloud services providers. At the same time, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s cloud revenue notched a strong showing.\n\nTech investors have also been beaten down by sharply rising interest rates in recent weeks, with the 10-year Treasury hitting over 5% this week before drifting lower. But Wednesday's selloff in the Nasdaq -- on pace for its worst performance in months -- could bring the dip buyers back in.\n\nAnalysts are watching to see what happens at next week's meeting at the Federal Reserve, which is expected to hold interest rates steady when it issues its decision on Wednesday. Chair Jerome Powell's press conference remarks that afternoon will be closely scrutinized for the Fed's thinking heading into the end of the year. The Fed will have fresh data to consider, including the first reading of third quarter gross domestic product, due out Thursday, and the September reading on inflation in the form of the personal consumption expenditures index.\n\nHere are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:\n\n1. Amazon reports\n\nE-commerce and cloud computing giant Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is expected to report earnings per share of 58 cents on revenue of $141.5 billion. Analysts will be listening to what it says about the upcoming holiday sales season.\n\n2.

Upon the strong earnings report, Spotify shares closed 10% up on Tuesday with its stock having more than doubled year to date, giving the company a market value of\u00a0$33.22 billion.\n\nChallenging Amazon\n\nAfter branching out into podcasts in 2015, Spotify\u00a0made a major push into audiobooks\u00a0to further diversify its revenue streams. It\u00a0announced earlier this month it will be providing\u00a0its\u00a0subscribers access to more than 150,000\u00a0audio books,\u00a0challenging Amazon and its Audible.\u00a0Its subscribers in the U.K and Australia already got this perk, while its U.S. launch is scheduled for winter.\n\nAccording to the latest earnings figures, Spotify is approaching profitability on the podcasting front. Spotify CFO Paul Vogel reiterated that the podcasting segment is expected to reach breakeven by next year. Amazon undoubtedly changed how people read but Spotify is poised to challenge its audiobook monopoly.\n\nQuarterly Highlights\n\nCost cutting measures such as lowered marketing spending and personnel costs that came from trimming 2% of its workforce enabled Spotify to post a\u00a0profit of 65 million euros ($68.9 million)\u00a0or 33 euro cents in earnings per share, topping LSEG\u2019s expectation of a loss of 22 euro cents. During the quarter that ended on September 30th, revenue expanded 11% YoY to\u00a03.36 billion euros, topping LSEG\u2019s expectation of\u00a03.33 billion. Price increases contributed to revenue growth, but Spotify also gathered\u00a0226 million\u00a0subscribers, topping\u00a0StreetAccount\u2019s estimate of\u00a0224 million. Advertising revenue grew 16% YoY and 11% quarter-over-quarter to \u20ac447 million (approximately $473.4 million).\n\nStory continues\n\nDuring the quarter, Spotify gathered\u00a0574 million monthly active users, also topping\u00a0572.1 million\u00a0that StreetAccount estimated.\u00a0Monthly active users drove 447 million euros of ad-supported revenue\u00a0that grew 16% YoY.\n\nSpotify is now deeply embodied in our everyday culture.\n\nView more earnings on NFLX\n\nStreaming is cheaper than buying music, while also being easier to get and nominally more ethical than piracy.\u00a0In 2022, Recording Industry Association of America revealed that streaming services accounted for 84 percent of recorded music revenues, while physical media made only 11 percent and falling digital downloads brought in merely 3 percent of revenue.\n\nOutlook\n\nThe music streaming giant is expecting\u00a0quarterly profits\u00a0to continue\u00a0both during the undergoing quarter and throughout the upcoming year while guiding for\u00a0fourth-quarter operating profit of \u20ac32 million.\u00a0Spotify expects to end the year with 235 million premium subscribers, which implies adding about 9 million in the final quarter, and 601 million monthly active users which implies 27 million additions.\n\nSpotify succeeded because it bailed large music groups out.\n\nSony Group Corporation (NYSE: SONY)\u00a0and Tencent Holdings Limited (OTC: TCEHY) who owns substantial portions in\u00a0Warner Music Group and\u00a0Universal Music Group\u00a0are all part-owners of Spotify which became their valued partner instead of aiming to cut them out. By doing so, it became the music industry\u2019s default platform.\n\nSince conquering the global streaming market one decade ago, one that it continues to dominate, it\u2019s safe to say that Spotify has successfully expanded from being a music streamer to an all-purpose audio platform and it is more than poised to challenge Amazon\u2019s dominance in the audio book universe.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

What I learned at an early age from him was to have the right habits early. Savings was an important lesson he taught me.\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes parents wait until their kids are in their teens before they start talking about managing money \u2014 when they could be starting when their kids are in preschool.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s teaching kids the value of a dollar, the difference between needs and wants or the value of saving \u2014 these are all concepts that kids encounter at a very early age, so it\u2019s best to help them to understand it.\u201d\n\nAll these are the sayings of Warren Buffett, the best money manager and investor in the world. Like most successful people in the world, Buffett\u2019s path to success started early in life, thanks to his parents.\n\nPerhaps one of the best gifts one could give to their child is helping them in achieving financial freedom early in life. Millions of Americans are struggling to buy a home, save for retirement, pay for education and cover basic expenses amid rising inflation and no savings. In a latest poll conducted by YouGov for Bankrate, about 56% of the respondents said they believe they are not able to save enough for retirement, while 37% them said they are \"significantly behind\u201d when it comes to retirement savings. The ideal nest egg amount Americans believe required to live a comfortable life in retirement is also increasing. Americans now feel that need about $1.8 million to retire comfortably, a whopping $100,000 more than the nest egg amount estimated last year.\n\nAmericans are notorious for being heavy spenders and bad savers. This problem is exacerbated by the rising inflation that is not showing any signs of cooling down significantly. The Bankrate survey showed that 1 in 4 baby boomers and 1 in 5 Gen Xers said they are not saving enough for retirement this year and they did not save anything last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn this backdrop, it\u2019s important to teach investing to kids and show them the importance of compounding. Analysts recommend average Americans to not only teach basic money management and investing to kids early in life, they also urge people to start stacking away small chunks of money for their kids. And this is where the magic of investing comes in. Instead of keeping money in your bank, it\u2019s always useful to let it do the work out there and increase. A detailed research paper by the Connecticut Government has a revealing data point to establish the importance of investing. Suppose you deposit $5,000 in a savings account for a \u201csafe\u201d 2% rate of interest, compounded annually. After 20 years you\u2019ll have $7,430. But imagine you\u2019d have put this $5,000 in one-year certificates of deposit (CDs) at the same bank, with instructions to roll over the proceeds into a new CD every 12 months. In addition, every month you also buy a $100 CD. After 20 years you\u2019d have made 3.44% annually and $44,000 in total. See the difference.\n\nBut what if you were told that you could covert this $5,000 into $171,000 in the same time period (20 years) with minimal risks?\u00a0 The research paper says:\n\n\u201cSince 1926, the stocks of large companies have produced an average annual return of about 10%. (Remember, that includes such lows as the Great Depression, the stock slide that followed the September 11 terrorist attacks and the financial crisis of 2008.) If we assume a long-term annual return of 8%, you\u2019ll need to add $382 a month to the initial $5,000 to reach your quarter-of-a-million-dollar goal in 20 years. If you can earn 10% annually, $279 a month will do the trick.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to long-term investments for a child, a common advice from experts boils down to this: put your money in broader market indices and let the markets do the work for you. Since investing for kids gives you a long time horizon, by the time your kid comes of age, they\u2019d have a sizable chunk of money thanks to the upward trajectory of the market.\n\nA McKinsey report provides some data which shows why it\u2019s useful to invest in ETFs and mutual funds tracking the broader market:\n\n\u201cIn 2001, the market capitalization of the companies that made up the S&P 500 was about $10 trillion. As of mid-June 2022 (even after a bearish opening to the year), S&P 500 market capitalization was about $32 trillion. The mean total yearly returns (including dividends) of the S&P 500 from 1996 to mid-June 2022 is 9 percent in nominal terms, or 6.8 percent in real terms\u2014in line with historical results.\n\nThere were fluctuations, of course. The S&P 500 declined in 2000, 2001, and 2002, followed by a 37 percent fall in 2008 and a 22 percent fall in the first half of 2022. But from 1996 to mid-June 2022, S&P 500 returns declined annually only five times.\n\nThe lesson for investors? Don\u2019t get sidetracked by short-term stock movements, which tend to stir up lots of headlines.\u201d Best Long-Term Investments for a Child\n\nCredit: Unsplash\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we scoured investing forums, analyst reports, and advice from money managers and billionaires and compiled a list of all investment options that are deemed the best for a child in the modern world. Investing for your kid via these vehicles is not guaranteed to make them rich, but data shows that these investment vehicles do give people an edge and increase their wealth over longer time horizons.\n\nBest Long-Term Investments for a Child\n\n12. Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF (NYSEARCA:SCHD)\n\nSchwab US Dividend Equity ETF (NYSEARCA:SCHD) is an ETF that tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100\u2122 Index. The ETF is safe and gives exposure to companies that have solid dividend-paying policies and history. For example, some of the top holdings of the ETF include AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) and Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO).\n\n11. VTI Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund ETF (NYSEARCA:VTI)\n\nVanguard Total Stock Market ETF is one of the best long-term investments since the ETF gives exposure to some of the major companies in the US. Its portfolio includes over 3800 companies, including mega-cap names like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA).\n\nBank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) recently said in a note that Apple could see an increase in its licensing and subscription revenues. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the most popular stocks among the elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey. Out of the 910 hedge funds in Insider Monkey\u2019s database, 135 hedge funds had stakes in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\n10. Starting a 529 Plan\n\nA 529 college savings plan is a state-sponsored investment that you can use to save money for your kid\u2019s education. You can withdraw funds tax-free to cover nearly any type of college expense. New regulations earlier this year paved way for 529 plans to be converted to Roth IRAs. People using 529 accounts usually set up small automatic payments from their bank to 529 to save up money for their kids\u2019 education.\n\n9. Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:VOO)\n\nVanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:VOO) is one of the best ways to let the money work over the long term. The ETF invests in the S&P 500 Index, representing 500 of the largest U.S. companies.\n\nSome of the top holdings of the ETF include Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the most popular stock among the 910 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey.\n\nAs of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 300 hedge funds had stakes in Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). The biggest stakeholder of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) after Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation was Chris Hohn\u2019s TCI Fund Management which owns a $4 billion stake in the company.\n\n8. SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY)\n\nInvesting in SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY) is another smart and easy way to gain exposure to the US stock market. The US stock market tends to go up over time, albeit slowly. The S&P 500 average return over the past decade has been around 12.39%, beating the long-term historic average of 10.7% since the benchmark index was introduced 65 years ago. You can invest in the broader index for your kid and by the time they grow up they\u2019d have a decent amount to use for their education and other life expenses.\n\nA Business Insider report quoted\u00a0 Jordan Gilberti, CFP and senior lead planner at\u00a0Facet., who said:\n\n\"Investing can be a good way to grow wealth over the long term, and offers the potential for higher returns compared to a typical checking or savings account.\u201d\n\n7. Schwab\u00ae S&P 500 Index Fund (MUTF:SWPPX)\n\nSchwab\u00ae S&P 500 Index Fund (MUTF:SWPPX) is another low-cost index fund to gain exposure to the broader S&P 500 companies. With no minimum investment conditions, the fund seeks to have exposure to the leading 500 leading U.S. companies. Some top holdings of the fund include Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\n6. Uniform Gifts to Minors Act (UGMA)/Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA) Accounts\n\nYou can open a custodial account under the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act (UGMA) or Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA) to hold gifts or transfers that a minor has received. The biggest benefit of using this kind of custodial account is that you don\u2019t need to establish a trust to gift money to your kids. Transferring money to custodial account is free of any tax up to a certain amount. When you cross this limit, the effective tax rate is still lower than normal tax rate because the government uses minor\u2019s tax rate instead of adult tax rate.\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Best Long-Term Investments for a Child.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n12 Best Upwork Alternatives for Freelancers and Employers Top 20 Countries With Most Natural Resources in the World 23 High-Paying Trade and Vocational Jobs in 2023\n\nDisclosure: None. 12 Best Long-Term Investments for a Child is originally published on Insider Monkey.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/12-best-long-term-investments-152616994.html", "symbols": ["AAPL.MX", "AAPL.US", "AAPL34.SA", "ABBV.US", "AMZN.US", "APC.F", "APC.XETRA", "BAC.US", "CSCO.US", "CVX.US", "GOOG.US", "GSPC.INDX", "MSF.F", "MSF.XETRA", "MSFT.MX", "MSFT.US", "MSFT34.SA", "PFE.US"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 1, "neg": 0.02, "neu": 0.866, "pos": 0.114}}, {"date": "2023-10-25T15:15:00+00:00", "title": "Should You Buy Amazon ETFs Ahead of Q3 Earnings?", "content": "Amazon AMZN is set to release third-quarter 2023 results on Oct 26, after market close. Being a market leader in e-commerce, it is worth taking a look at the company\u2019s fundamentals ahead of its results (see: all the Consumer Discretionary ETFs here).\r\n\r\nAmazon has lost 0.5% over the past three months and underperformed the industry, with an average decline of 7%. The underperformance might reverse if the online behemoth comes up with an earnings beat.\r\n\r\nThis has brought ETFs \u2014 ProShares Online Retail ETF ONLN, Fidelity MSCI Consumer Discretionary Index ETF FDIS, Vanguard Consumer Discretionary ETF VCR, Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund XLY and VanEck Vectors Retail ETF RTH \u2014 with a substantial allocation to this online behemoth in focus.\n\nInside Our Methodology\n\nAmazon has an Earnings ESP of -2.11% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). According to our surprise prediction methodology, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\r\n\r\nThe stock saw no earnings estimate revision in the past 30 days for the third quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate implies year-over-year earnings growth of 190% for the to-be-reported quarter. Additionally, Amazon\u2019s earnings surprise history is impressive, with a surprise of 40.96%, on average, in the last four quarters. However, the company is expected to report revenue growth of 11.4%. The stock has a solid Growth and Momentum Score of B each and falls under a top-ranked Zacks industry (top 37%).\r\n\r\nAmazon currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.14 on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell etc.) made by 40 brokerage firms. The current ABR compares to an ABR of 1.20 a month ago based on 38 recommendations.\r\n\r\nOf the 40 recommendations deriving the current ABR, 35 are Strong Buy and four are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy, respectively, account for 87.5% and 10% of all recommendations. A month ago, Strong Buy made up 84.21%, while Buy represented 10.53%.\r\n\r\nBased on short-term price targets offered by 39 analysts, the average price target for Amazon comes to $169.51. The forecasts range from a low of $118.00 to a high of $230.00.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat to Watch?\n\nIn its last earnings release, the world's largest online retailer said it expects revenues in the range of $138-$143 billion for the third quarter of 2023.\n\nETFs in Focus\n\nProShares Online Retail ETF (ONLN)\r\n\r\nProShares Online Retail ETF offers exposure to companies that principally sell online or through other non-store channels and then zeros in on the companies that reshape the retail space.

The robots are coming and they\u2019re being stuck with a truly thankless task.\n\nThe e-commerce company recently expanded its relationship with Agility Robotics, a startup developing Digit, a \u201chuman-centric\u201d multi-purpose robot designed for logistics work. And Amazon\u2019s initial plans for Digit involve tote recycling, which is described as \u201ca highly repetitive process of picking up and moving empty totes once inventory has been completely picked out of them.\u201d\n\nMost Read on IEN:\n\nUAW Strikes at GM Plant in Texas as Union Goes After Cash Cows Agility to Open World's First Humanoid Robot Factory Podcast: Yuengling's Struggles; Legacy Die Maker May Close; Old Lordstown CEO Buys Back In Company Debuts 'Industry's Tallest Mobile Robot'\n\nEmily Vetterick, director of engineering at Amazon, said \u201cDigit\u2019s size and shape are well-suited for buildings that are designed for humans, and we believe that there is a big opportunity to scale a mobile manipulator solution. Collaborative robotics solutions like Digit support workplace safety and help Amazon deliver to customers faster, while creating new opportunities and career paths for our employees.\u201d\n\nFor Agility, testing with Amazon will serve as an important proving ground for Digit, which is being built to safely work alongside people. Digit will first undergo testing at Amazon\u2019s robotics research and development facility near Seattle. If that goes well, Digit could soon be used to make the logistics process less tedious for Amazon\u2019s human workforce.\n\nAgility is betting big on the viability of Digit. The company recently announced plans to build RoboFab, a 70,000-square-foot robot manufacturing facility in nearby Salem, Oregon. Agility expects to produce hundreds of Digit robots in the first year and to eventually scale production up to 10,000 robots per year.

Going by the price targets, the mean estimate of $169.51 indicates a potential upside of 31.9%.\n\nThe average comprises 39 short-term price targets ranging from a low of $118 to a high of $230, with a standard deviation of $21.04. While the lowest estimate indicates a decline of 8.2% from the current price level, the most optimistic estimate points to a 78.9% upside. More than the range, one should note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts.\n\nWhile the consensus price target is a much-coveted metric for investors, solely banking on this metric to make an investment decision may not be wise at all. That's because the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable.\n\nHowever, an impressive consensus price target is not the only factor that indicates a potential upside in AMZN. This view is strengthened by the agreement among analysts that the company will report better earnings than what they estimated earlier. Though a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't give any idea as to how much the stock could surge, it has proven effective in predicting an upside.\n\nHere's What You Should Know About Analysts' Price Targets\n\nAccording to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading.\n\nWhile Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why?\n\nStory continues\n\nThey usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts.\n\nHowever, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces.\n\nThat said, while investors should not entirely ignore price targets, making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing ROI. So, price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism.\n\nHere's Why There Could be Plenty of Upside Left in AMZN\n\nThere has been increasing optimism among analysts lately about the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher. And that could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock. After all, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nOver the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.2%, as two estimates have moved higher compared to no negative revision.\n\nMoreover, AMZN currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on four factors related to earnings estimates. Given an impressive externally-audited track record, this is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential upside in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, while the consensus price target may not be a reliable indicator of how much AMZN could gain, the direction of price movement it implies does appear to be a good guide.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Amazon employs hundreds of thousands of warehouse workers in the US.\n\nAmazon didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment on the study.\n\nThe report, the broadest academic survey of Amazon workers to date, adds to the growing scrutiny of the company\u2019s sprawling logistics operation. Amazon is the second-largest private-sector employer behind Walmart Inc., and employs about 29% of the country\u2019s warehousing workers, the researchers estimate. That gives the company outsize influence over the industry\u2019s working conditions and compensation.\n\nCritics say Amazon pushes employees to work too hard and too quickly, leading to avoidable injuries. Workplace safety regulators in Amazon\u2019s home state of Washington allege a direct connection between employee monitoring and discipline and musculoskeletal disorders suffered by its workers. The federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration, meanwhile, has cited Amazon for exposing workers to ergonomic risks at several facilities across the country.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon says the regulators\u2019 allegations are inaccurate and is challenging them, including during weeks of hearings held recently on the Washington state citations. The company says its investments in worker safety, including a push to automate repetitive and arduous tasks, are helping reduce the injury rate.\n\nGutelius and co-author Sanjay Pinto say 63% of workers acknowledged that Amazon has made safety a high priority. But many suffer injuries anyway, and workers who say they have trouble keeping up are more likely to be hurt on the job, according to Gutelius.\n\n\u201cThe harder it is for a worker to maintain the pace of work, the more likely it is that they are injured,\u201d she said.\n\nEmployees also suffered work-related mental health issues. More than half of those surveyed reported feeling burned out. The portion of workers reporting burnout increases with job tenure, the researchers say.\n\nThe researchers excluded results that didn\u2019t take the questions seriously or appeared to feign employment with Amazon. Managers and drivers were also excluded. Responses were weighted to align demographically with Amazon\u2019s own published statistics on the racial and gender breakdowns of its workforce.\n\nOverall, 41% of workers reported being injured while working at an Amazon warehouse. The share rises to 51% for people who have worked at the company for more than three years.\n\nResearchers found their subjects using ads on Meta Platforms Inc. apps, targeting people who listed Amazon as their employer or lived in areas where the company operates. The project received funding from the Ford Foundation, the National Employment Law Project and Oxfam America.\n\n\u201cThey are taking some steps, but tinkering around the margins isn\u2019t going to work,\u201d Pinto said of Amazon\u2019s attempts to reduce injuries within its ranks. \u201cThere\u2019s something fundamental about the system that needs to change.\u201d\n\n(Updated with request for company response in fifth paragraph.

Its recent first quarter 2024 results showcased earnings per share of $1.83, outpacing analyst estimates by 11 cents while affirming its operational strength.\n\nP&G\u2019s CEO anticipates lower commodity prices in fiscal 2024 to effectively bring in $800 million in savings, potentially contributing an added 34 cents to its profits.\n\nFurthermore, the company\u2019s financial acumen shines with its astute projection to convert 90% of its net earnings into free cash flow, resulting in an impressive $13.4 billion.\n\nIts powerful cash position not only covers dividend payments but also supports its ongoing share repurchase initiatives. Looking ahead, P&G is poised for a rebound in sales volume, thanks to easing year-over-year comparisons and a strategic bump in advertising and retail execution.\n\nAlso, the potential for sales revitalization in China, P&G\u2019s largest market outside the U.S., adds another layer of optimism.\n\nJohnson & Johnson\u00a0(JNJ) A red Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) sign hangs inside in Moscow, Russia.\n\nSource: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.com\n\nJohnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), a renowned name in the healthcare space, recently unveiled third quarter results zooming past Wall Street estimates, with both earnings and revenues surpassing expectations.\n\nThis positive trend is part of a larger narrative of resilience and strategic growth, especially after it divested its consumer health segment, Kenvue, in August. This strategic move has allowed JNJ to channel its energies into its high-performing pharmaceutical and medical devices sectors, showing robust sales.\n\nAlso, JNJ is an established \u201cdividend king,\u201d boasting an incredible 60-year streak of escalating dividends, underscoring its reliability as an income stock. The current forward dividend yield stands at an attractive 3.1%, with dividends having surged by an average of 6% annually over the past five years.\n\nThe recent quarter saw JNJ record an earnings-per-share of $2.66, outstripping the predicted $2.52, and revenues touching $21.35 billion, higher than the anticipated $21.04 billion. Moreover, sales have witnessed a 6.8% upswing from the same period last year.\n\nEmboldened by these stellar figures, JNJ has revised its full-year guidance upwards, forecasting 2023 sales between $83.6 billion and $84 billion and an EPS range of $10.07 to $10.13.\n\nAmazon\u00a0(AMZN) Amazon LOGO ON THE SIDE OF A BUILDING.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Amazon is a top-tier tech giant birthed from a modest online bookstore in the \u201990s, which now stands as an indomitable force in global ecommerce.\n\nIts empire isn\u2019t just built on a growing Prime membership or an efficient delivery system; it\u2019s also anchored in AWS\u2019s cloud supremacy and strides into multiple areas, including entertainment, health, and even grocery. Innovation is Amazon\u2019s native language, spoken through ventures including satellite technology and AI-powered shopping vistas.\n\nWall Street is abuzz, with Amazon expected to report its earnings report on Thursday. Analysts project a modest EPS of 55 cents, along with a stunning revenue forecast of $134.2 billion.\n\nThis isn\u2019t baseless optimism, though, as the tech titan boasts a track record of jaw-dropping earnings surprises, topping 40% in recent quarters, and a predicted growth rate of an astounding 190% this quarter alone.\n\nRetail margins appear poised for expansion. Amid these variables, Amazon stands on the cusp of possibly delivering another round of applause from Wall Street, effectively defying market expectations.\n\nKellanova\u00a0(K) Kellogg's sign on their Canada's head office building in Mississauga\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nKellanova (NYSE:K), following Kellogg\u2019s strategic spinoff, now boasts high-margin names under its umbrella, including Eggo and Pringles, leaving WK Kellogg with the more sedate cereal segment. It is zeroing in on the profitable snack sector, poised to maintain its appeal backed by unwavering consumer indulgence in snacks.\n\nInvestors eyeing stability will appreciate the forward dividend yield of 4.56%, an annual forward payout of $2.25. While the five-year growth rate modestly ticks at 1.69%, the consistency is noteworthy with 18 years of dividend growth.\n\nAdding to its financial mettle, Kellanova has surpassed earnings estimates for ten straight quarters. Kellogg Company clocked a 4.6% rise in second quarter revenue, hitting $4.04 billion, albeit narrowly missing projected figures.\n\nHowever, a robust 7.1% jump in organic sales underscored the quarter\u2019s success, fueled by favorable pricing and a sustained snack segment upswing. Moreover, it trades at 1.3 times forward sales estimates, with a 28.2% upside potential from current price levels.\n\nAbbVie\u00a0(ABBV) Closeup of AbbVie (ABBV) building corporate office, an American biopharmaceutical company with its headquarters in Lake Bluff, Illinois, USA\n\nSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com\n\nAbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) is charting an impressive course through the pharma realm\u2019s choppy waters. While many companies flounder with the expiration of drug patents, the company has effectively navigated this common sector pitfall.\n\nIt\u2019s transitioning gracefully from reliance on its long-standing moneymaker, Humira, by boosting its portfolio with promising newcomers, including Skyrizi and Rinvoq. These innovative drugs aren\u2019t just filling the gap; they\u2019re registering substantial growth at 50% and 55%, respectively, redefining AbbVie\u2019s revenue streams.\n\nAbbVie isn\u2019t merely a tale of successful product transition; it\u2019s a dividend marvel, boasting uninterrupted growth since 1972 with a forward yield of 4%.\n\nWith 51 years of consecutive dividend increases and an upgraded earnings outlook, AbbVie stands as a testament to strategic adaptation in the pharmaceutical space. For investors, this could mean a blend of steady income and the potential for long-term growth as the company continues its evolution.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nMusk\u2019s \u201cProject Omega\u201d May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

The trend is expected to have continued in the yet-to-be-reported quarter.\n\nAWS\u2019 revenues were $22.1 billion in second-quarter 2023, accounting for 17% of net sales, rising 12% year over year.\n\nWe believe that an expanding customer base and a strong discount offering for long-term deals are likely to have driven AWS\u2019 top line in the quarter under review.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter 2023 AWS net sales is pegged at $23.19 billion, indicating an improvement of 12.9% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s reported figure.\n\nClick here to find out how the company\u2019s overall third-quarter performance is expected to have been.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Amazon.com, Inc. Quote\n\nFactors to Consider\n\nThe expanding data center network and an increasing number of AWS regions and availability zones are likely to have acted as tailwinds.\n\nIn the third quarter, the company launched an infrastructure region in Tel Aviv, Israel. AWS Israel (Tel Aviv) Region is comprised of three availability zones.\n\nIts strength across the AWS cloud services portfolio is expected to have continued benefiting the segment\u2019s performance in the third quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nBoth factors are expected to have aided Amazon in sustaining momentum among existing customers and attracting new ones.\n\nIn the quarter under review, AWS was selected by PT Telekomunikasi Selular (Telkomsel) and Abdul Latif Jameel as a preferred cloud provider. BMW Group and Dr. Reddy\u2019s Laboratories also picked AWS as the preferred cloud provider.\n\nFanDuel also picked AWS as its strategic cloud provider.\n\nOccidental favored AWS as its preferred cloud provider to enhance operational efficiencies and eliminate upfront capital expenditures.\n\nOccidental is transferring its core production applications and on-premises information technology infrastructure to AWS to accelerate its digital transformation and the development of systems for carbon removal plants.\n\nMeanwhile, Sumitomo selected AWS to drive its digital transformation by migrating its SAP environments to AWS.\n\nZacks Rank & Stocks to Consider\n\nCurrently, Amazon carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nSome better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Dell Technologies and Applied Materials.

Investors will be closely tuned into the releases as the market looks to extend its 2023 rally into year-end.\n\nPositive results from the bunch would undoubtedly be bullish for the market, particularly if we hear uplifting commentary surrounding current business conditions. Regarding this week\u2019s slate, Amazon and Meta Platforms are scheduled to report, representing two of the \u2018Big 7.\u2019\n\nBut how do expectations stack up heading into their respective release? Let\u2019s take a closer look at recent sentiment and a few key metrics as a light guide.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nIt\u2019s been the 'year of efficiency' for Meta Platforms, with the company\u2019s quarterly results in 2023 regularly bringing fireworks post-earnings. The company has exceeded the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by an average of nearly 20% across its last four releases.\n\nAnalysts have been bullish for the upcoming release, with the $3.62 Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate up roughly 5% since the beginning of August. Top line revisions have also been positive, as the $33.4 billion quarterly revenue estimate has moved 1.2% higher during the same period.\n\nMany will be interested in the company\u2019s Reality Labs performance, a segment that includes Meta\u2019s augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) related consumer hardware, software, and content. The segment has come under scrutiny in the past following concerns about its profitability.\n\nNonetheless, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Reality Labs revenue stands at $315 million, suggesting growth of 10.5% from the year-ago period. The company stated in its latest release that it expects Reality Lab operating losses to increase into 2024 as it continues investing to scale its ecosystem.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe consensus expectation is that the Reality Labs segment will post a $4.1 billion operating loss in Q3, above the $3.7 billion mark in the prior quarter.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that META shares aren\u2019t overly expensive given the forecasted top and bottom line growth, with shares currently trading at a 23.5X forward earnings multiple (F1), in line with the five-year median.\n\nMeta\u2019s earnings are forecasted to climb 38% in its current year (FY23) on 14% higher sales.\n\nAmazon\n\nAmazon\u2019s quarterly results in 2023 have consistently exceeded expectations, beating the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by at least 40% across its last three releases and snapping a streak of negative surprises that started in 2022.\n\nCurrently, the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $0.58 represents 190% growth from the year-ago quarter, with the estimate up a bullish 49% since the beginning of August. In addition, the $141.6 billion quarterly revenue estimate implies growth of 11.6%, being revised 2.5% higher during the same period.\n\nSimilar to META, Amazon\u2019s quarterly results in 2023 have been aided by a focus on efficiency. Throughout its latest quarter, operating income jumped to $7.7 billion from $3.3 billion in the year-ago period, and operating cash flow increased 74% to $61.8 billion.\n\nIn addition, it\u2019s worth noting that Amazon hosted its biggest-ever Prime Day event earlier in July, with over 375 million items purchased and reflecting a strong consumer.\n\nRegarding Amazon\u2019s key metrics, Amazon Web Services (AWS) results are the common focus among investors. Regarding AWS expectations for the upcoming print, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for AWS Net Sales stands at $23.2 billion, 13% higher than the year-ago figure.\n\nAs shown below, the company has recently exceeded expectations for AWS Net Sales in back-to-back releases. It\u2019s more than reasonable to assume Amazon will discuss AWS results heavily, particularly as investors seek further clarity surrounding enterprise demand.\n\nBottom Line\n\nMega-cap technology dominates the reporting docket this week, with the likes of these big companies scheduled to reveal quarterly results.\n\nBoth companies have enjoyed positive top and bottom line estimate revisions, with each also expected to post sizable growth relative to the same period last year.\n\nWhy Haven\u2019t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +6.2 average gain per year.

If you want to skip our overview of the telecommunications industry, then take a look at 5 Best Telecom Stocks To Buy Right Now.\n\nThe telecommunications industry is one of the most important in the world right now, and before the advent of the internet era, it was responsible for ushering in the wave of globalization. Before the telephone was invented, long distance communication could only be carried out through the telegraph, and this limited communications as the telegraph could only send messages in text form that were coded and then decoded.\n\nWith the spread of the internet, the telecommunications industry has also seen significant changes, in an interesting development as the early days of internet connectivity saw users rely on their telephone to go online in the 1990s and the early 2000s. Since then, traditional telecommunications mediums, such as the telephone and cellular connectivity have faced stiff competition as high speed internet courtesy of 4G, LTE, and now 5G has enabled users to rely on voice over internet protocol (VOIP) to make phone calls and send messages. VOIP services such as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s WhatsApp have allowed users to avoid paying for phone packages, and instead rely on internet coverage to communicate with each other.\n\nAdditionally, cell phone coverage provides users in most regions of the world with the ability to contact others thousands of miles away; a convenience that was unavailable to the mass market before the turn of the millennium. Satellite connectivity is a key drive of long distance telecommunications, and newer satellites even seek to help users who might be unable to gain a connection through a cell phone tower.\n\nWhile traditionally telecommunications satellites were located at much higher altitudes to expand their coverage map at the expense of coverage loss at higher altitudes, an opening of low Earth orbit (LEO) courtesy of existing and planned rocket systems is also ushering in changes to connectivity. Most telecommunications satellites before the recent developments circled the Earth around the equator, which limited their ability to end signals down to individual devices and towers at higher latitudes such as regions in the Arctic. Additionally, the higher altitude (geostationary satellites orbit at altitudes in excess of 30,000 kilometers) also left traditional satellite phones prone to latency, even when used inside airplanes.\n\nStory continues\n\nThese limitations are also present in internet networks that rely on the heftier geostationary satellites, with internet coverage being one area where LEO satellites have shown their disruptive potential to the telecommunications sector. Internet coverage has typically been the domain of carriers, particularly during the early days of dial up coverage. Then, as fiber networks and associated infrastructure required heftier investments and even today, firms such as Lumen Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:LUMN) (previously CenturyLink) offer both fixed line voice and internet services to users.\n\nLEO satellites are now filling the gap left by fixed wireless broadband in regions where large firms are hesitant to commit significant financial resources due to inadequate returns. Regions in the U.S., the polar areas, Canada, Australia, and other countries often have users living far away from cities and missing out on internet coverage as a result. At the same time, poor customer support often leaves many people seeking alternatives and choosing to settle down with satellite internet even if it's slower than broadband simply to avoid the hassle of dealing with complex billing procedures and charges.\n\nAlong with Lumen Technologies, other fixed internet and telecommunications firms include Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:SPB), Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), Cox Enterprises, Inc., and Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA)'s Xfinity. As the telecommunications industry matures, internet and telephony service providers are also starting to shift their infrastructure to fiber. For example, AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) does not offer new DSL connections as it encourages even existing DSL customers to shift to fiber networks instead.\n\nFinally, with space access becoming cheaper and easier courtesy of SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket, the Starlink satellite internet constellation has rapidly grown to become one of the largest internet networks in the world. SpaceX has launched thousands of small Starlink internet satellites to date, and even Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is entering this industry through its Kuiper satellites. Kuiper, an Amazon subsidiary, has earmarked $10 billion in investments for satellite fabrication, launch, user terminals, and ground system operations as part of a functioning internet network that promises to offer internet speeds ranging from 100 Mbps to 1 Gbps depending on the consumer terminal and coverage option.\n\nWith this backdrop, as traditional land coverage providers shift their networks to fiber and new entrants offer wider coverage, we made a list of telecommunications stocks that smart money is piling into. Within this list, some top hedge fund telecommunications stock picks are Charter Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHTR), T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS), and Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA). 12 Best Telecom Stocks To Buy Right Now\n\nA technician installing advanced cellular equipment at a 5G cell tower.

To skip the latest news and detailed analysis around the auto industry, go directly to the 5 Fastest Growing Auto Stocks to Buy.\n\nOver the last few years, the automotive industry has gone through significant changes, such as the increasing demand of electric vehicles (EVs) and the increased spending on autonomous vehicle research and deployment. However, these days, the latest strike by the United Auto Workers (UAW) is the hottest topic in the auto industry. The union is targeting Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), and Stellantis N.V. (NYSE:STLA) and its primary demand is a 40% wage hike with a 20% immediate increase. According to Wells Fargo analysts, the increase in demanded salaries and wages would \u201cadd an estimated $700 million to $1.2 billion in costs to each company over the four-year life of the contract.\u201d\n\nThe vice president of the union\u2019s GM department said on October 20 that both parties are moving toward a tentative agreement that could possibly end the 5-week strike. It has been reported that General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) is offering a 20% raise over the next four years while Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) offered 23%. The companies are eager to put things back to normal. General Motors Company (NYSE:GM)\u2019s management said:\n\n\"It is time for us to finish this process, get our team members back to work and get on with the business of making GM the company that will win and provide great jobs in the U.S. for our people for decades to come.\"\n\nEven though UAW President, Shawn Fain, believes that there is \u201cmore to be won,\u201d the union has not announced any further strikes yet. It is quite evident that these strikes are going to significantly affect the upcoming earnings reports of auto companies. However, Richard Hilgert, a Senior Equity Analyst for the automotive sector at Morningstar\u2019s research arm, says that the auto manufacturers can still evade massive losses if the strikes don\u2019t prolong.\n\nStory continues\n\nLatest in the Auto Industry\n\nAlthough the electrification of vehicles and autonomous vehicle technologies aren\u2019t that new, their demand and sales have certainly surged remarkably in the last few years. According to our previous report, the autonomous vehicle industry is expected to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 40% between 2021 and 2030. Some major companies that have introduced self-driving cars include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). Moreover, Honda Motor Co., Ltd. (NYSE:HMC) and General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), in a joint venture with GM\u2019s subsidiary, Cruise, are planning to start a self-driving taxi service in Japan in 2026.\n\nCompared to autonomous vehicles, EV adoption has been notably faster and EV stocks have been some of the fastest-growing vehicles stocks in 2023. In 2022, the number of alternative energy vehicles sold crossed 10 million, showing a 54% year-over-year (YoY) increase. In 2023, the International Energy Agency (IEA) believes that this number could reach 14 million.\n\nThe companies that are currently dominating the EV market include Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) and BYD Company Limited (OTC:BYDDY). Nevertheless, automotive giants such as General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM), and Stellantis N.V. (NYSE:STLA) have also started to invest heavily in the sector. In fact, Stellantis N.V. (NYSE:STLA) has already captured a noteworthy market share of the industry and is one of the top ten EV manufacturers in the world.\n\nDespite the recent events that put a bearish light on the automotive industry, it still is poised for growth in the future. Analysts believe that the total vehicle sales will surpass 69 million units in 2023, and reach around 74 million in 2024. For the current year, some of the fastest-growing automotive stocks include Modine Manufacturing Company (NYSE:MOD), Carvana Co. (NYSE:CVNA), and Li Auto Inc. (NASDAQ:LI).

At truck manufacturer PACCAR, operating margins remain strong, supported by new truck models, improved manufacturing efficiency, and a growing aftermarket parts division.\u201d\n\n8. Stellantis N.V. (NYSE:STLA)\n\n1-year stock price growth as of October 20: 40.79%\n\nStellantis N.V. (NYSE:STLA) is a well-known car manufacturer that came into being as a result of a merger between the Italian-American giant, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) and the French PSA Group. One of the fastest-growing automotive stocks, Stellantis N.V.

It distributes accessories, parts, and related services through its brand, Mopar while its Spoticar brand is responsible for selling used cars.\n\nIn Q2, Stellantis N.V.

(NYSE:STLA), which makes Jeep, Dodge and Fiat cars. The company has a nearly 8% dividend yield with enough net cash (cash minus debt) on the balance sheet to cover the dividend for almost five years. The company trades at 1.7x operating profits, which means the market is already expecting a likely drop in cash flow. Still, the shares appear to be worth meaningfully more than where they trade, and management is heavily aligned with stockholders with a 14% stake. They share our view that the valuation is compelling, as the company plans on repurchasing ~3% of shares outstanding this year.\u201d\n\n7. Honda Motor Co., Ltd. (NYSE:HMC)\n\n1-year stock price growth as of October 20: 47.28%\n\nHonda Motor Co., Ltd. (NYSE:HMC) is a Tokyo-based automotive corporation that is famous for producing motorcycles and automobiles while also selling power products. It is one of the fastest-growing car stocks and has a foothold in North America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia.\n\nEarlier in 2023, Honda Motor Co., Ltd. (NYSE:HMC) announced its plan to go full electric by 2040 and has been taking steps to fulfill that goal. The sales of the company\u2019s new EV models are set to be in 2024 in the U.S. and Japan.

(NASDAQ:EVGO) to provide various perks to eligible Honda and Acura EV drivers like access to EVgo\u2019s 900 public fast charging locations, charging credit, and more.

(NYSE:MUFG) to monitor and improve energy management by optimizing the usage of Honda Motor Co., Ltd. (NYSE:HMC)\u2019s mini-EV model battery.\n\nHonda Motor Co., Ltd.

(NYSE:HMC), a manufacturer of cars, motorcycles, general-purpose engines, and a range of other power products in the consumer discretionary sector. The company has struggled to make progress in improving its recent mediocre sales trends while its current plan for transitioning to electric vehicles and motors is less compelling than its more transparent peers. Given the risk of the Japanese yen strengthening as yet another headwind to the company\u2019s intermediate performance, we elected to close the position in favor of other opportunities.\u201d\n\n6.

Located and operated within Europe, the AWS European Sovereign Cloud will be physically and logically separate from existing AWS Regions, with the same security, availability, and performance of existing AWS Regions, giving customers additional choice to meet their data residency, operational autonomy, and resiliency needs. The AWS European Sovereign Cloud will launch with its first AWS Region in Germany and will be available to all European customers. To learn more, visit aws.amazon.com/compliance/europe-digital-sovereignty/.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs with existing AWS Regions, customers will have the control and assurance that AWS will not access or use customer data for any purpose without their agreement, as well as access to the strongest sovereignty controls among leading cloud providers. Only EU-resident AWS employees who are located in the EU will have control of the operations and support for the AWS European Sovereign Cloud. For customers with enhanced data residency needs, the AWS European Sovereign Cloud will allow customers to keep all metadata they create (such as the roles, permissions, resource labels, and configurations they use to run AWS) in the EU, and will feature its own billing and usage metering systems.\n\n\"The AWS European Sovereign Cloud reinforces our commitment to offering AWS customers the most advanced set of sovereignty controls, privacy safeguards, and security features available in the cloud,\" said Max Peterson, vice president of Sovereign Cloud at AWS. \"For more than a decade, we\u2019ve worked with governments and regulatory bodies across Europe to understand and meet evolving needs in cybersecurity, data privacy and localization, and more recently, digital sovereignty. With this new offering, customers and Partners across Europe will have more choice to achieve the operational independence they require, without compromising on the broadest and deepest cloud services that millions of customers already know and use today.\"\n\n\"The development of a European AWS cloud will make it much easier for many public sector organizations and companies with high data security and data protection requirements to use AWS services,\" said Claudia Plattner, president, German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI). \"We are aware of the innovative power of modern cloud services, and we want to help make them securely available for Germany and Europe. The C5 (Cloud Computing Compliance Criteria Catalogue), which was developed by the BSI, has significantly shaped cybersecurity cloud standards, and AWS was, in fact, the first cloud service provider to receive the BSI\u2019s C5 testate. In this respect, we are very pleased to constructively accompany the local development of an AWS cloud, which will also contribute to European sovereignty, in terms of security.\"\n\nThe AWS European Sovereign Cloud will be sovereign-by-design and will be built on more than a decade of AWS\u2019s experience operating multiple independent clouds for the most critical and restricted workloads. Customers who need more options to address stringent isolation and in-country data residency needs will be able to leverage existing offerings like AWS Outposts or AWS Dedicated Local Zones to deploy AWS European Sovereign Cloud infrastructure in locations they select. AWS Outposts are fully managed solutions that deliver AWS infrastructure and services to virtually any on-premises or edge location for a consistent hybrid experience. They are designed for workloads that need to remain on-premises due to latency, data processing, and data residency requirements, where customers want those workloads to run seamlessly with their other workloads in AWS. AWS Dedicated Local Zones are a type of infrastructure built for exclusive use by a customer or community and placed in a customer-specified location. They are designed to reduce the operational overhead of managing on-premises infrastructure at scale, and can be configured to meet a customer\u2019s specific regulatory requirements.\n\nAWS European Sovereign Cloud customers will benefit from the same low latency and high availability they expect from existing AWS Regions, and from access to the world\u2019s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud to drive innovation. The AWS European Sovereign Cloud will offer multiple Availability Zones, infrastructure that is placed in separate and distinct geographic locations, with enough distance to significantly reduce the risk of a single event impacting customers\u2019 business continuity, yet near enough to provide low latency for high availability applications that use multiple Availability Zones. Each Availability Zone has independent power, cooling, and physical security, and is connected through redundant, ultra-low latency networks.\n\nAWS offers the largest and most comprehensive cloud infrastructure globally, with 102 Availability Zones across 32 geographic regions, and has plans to launch 15 more Availability Zones and five more AWS Regions in Canada, Germany, Malaysia, New Zealand, and Thailand. AWS infrastructure in Europe currently includes eight AWS Regions in Frankfurt, Ireland, London, Milan, Paris, Stockholm, Spain, and Zurich and more than 120 Content Distribution Network (CDN) points of presence in more than 25 cities across 19 European Member States. Some of the largest AWS development teams are located in Europe, with key centers in Dublin, Dresden, and Berlin. Today, Amazon is creating thousands of high-quality jobs and investing billions of euros in European economies. Across the EU, Amazon has created more than 100,000 permanent jobs, and many major components of AWS, including the AWS Nitro System and Amazon CloudWatch, are built in the EU. AWS European Sovereign Cloud will drive economic development through investing in infrastructure, jobs, and skills in communities and countries across Europe. As part of a continued commitment to contribute to the development of digital skills, AWS will hire and develop additional local personnel to operate and support the AWS European Sovereign Cloud.\n\nCustomers, AWS Partners, and regulators welcome AWS European Sovereign Cloud\n\nOrganizations across the European Union are among the millions of active customers using AWS in more than 190 countries around the world. AWS provides the most comprehensive compliance controls, supporting 143 security standards and compliance certifications, to help customers satisfy regulatory requirements around the globe. To meet additional data residency, operational autonomy, and resiliency needs in Europe, AWS is collaborating closely with European regulators and national cybersecurity agencies to build the AWS European Sovereign Cloud. Many regulators, customers, and AWS Partners across Europe welcome the new AWS European Sovereign Cloud.\n\n\"We welcome the commitment of AWS to expand its infrastructure with an independent European cloud. This will give businesses and public sector organizations more choice in meeting digital sovereignty requirements,\" said Dr. Markus Richter, chief information officer of the German federal government. \"Cloud services are essential for the digitization of the public administration. With the \u2018German Administration Cloud Strategy\u2019 and the \u2018EVB-IT Cloud\u2019 contract standard, the foundations for cloud use in the public administration have been established. I am very pleased to work together with AWS to practically and collaboratively implement sovereignty in line with our cloud strategy.\"\n\n\"The German and European economies are on course for digitization. The strong German \u2018Mittelstand\u2019 which are small and medium-sized enterprises, in particular need a sovereign digital infrastructure that meets the highest requirements in order to continue to be competitive in the global market,\" said Stefan Schnorr, state secretary at the German Federal Ministry for Digital and Transport. \"For our digital independence, it is important that computing power is generated locally in Germany and that further investments are made in the digitalization of the local economy.

The 10-year Treasury yield fell by 0.64% to 4.815.\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) shares rose by over 4.5% in extended-hours trading after the company reported fiscal first-quarter results that exceeded expectations. This was largely due to the strong growth in its Azure cloud. Microsoft's cloud services revenue, which is primarily comprised of Azure, grew by 29%, or 28% year-over-year in constant currency. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) shares also rose in extended-hours trading due to the strong cloud results.\n\nWarning!

Revenues grew by 11% to $76.69B, breaking a string of single-digit revenue gains amid an ongoing advertising-market recovery.

Revenue of $8.6B (+10.3% Y/Y) also beat expectations by $50M.

Looking ahead, Texas Instruments expects fourth-quarter sales to be between $3.93B and $4.27B, below the $4.49B that analysts were anticipating.\n\nStory continues\n\nMarathon Digital (NASDAQ:MARA) filed for a prospectus relating to a mixed shelf offering for an initial offering price of up to $750M.

Amongst them will be Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) with the ecommerce behemoth slated to deliver its third-quarter financial statement on Thursday (Oct 26) after the close.\n\nLooking ahead to the results, Monness\u2019 Brian White, a 5-star analyst ranked in the top 1% of Street experts, is looking for Amazon to deliver revenues of $142.34 billion (above the Street at $141.43 billion). White\u2019s figure factors in a 12% year-over-year increase, which represents a \u201cslight acceleration\u201d from the 11% uptick seen in Q2, but not quite at the level of the the 15% growth posted in the year-ago period. On a sequential basis, the Q3 revenue forecast amounts to a 6% quarter-over-quarter improvement, which is a tad higher than the four-year, September quarter average of +5%.\n\nWhite is calling for operating income of $8.46 billion and a 5.9% operating margin and at the bottom-line, projects EPS of $0.63 (also higher than consensus at $0.58). However, White also notes that as Amazon has \u201cdemonstrated in the past, EPS is susceptible to quarterly swings in the share price of Rivian Automotive and non-operating charges.\u201d\n\nAmazon for its part has guided for Q3 revenue between $138.0-143.0 billion and operating income between $5.5 billion to $8.5 billion.\n\nMoving forward to the holiday season quarter, for Q4, White estimates sales of $174.13 billion (a 17% year-over-year increase and above the Street at $166.67 billion) and EPS of $0.76, also higher than consensus at $0.66.\n\nSumming up, while White sees Amazon as a long-term winner, he signs off with a warning about what might be coming next. \u201cWe believe Amazon is well positioned to benefit from digital transformation, capitalize on the cloud, innovate with AI, participate in new healthcare-related opportunities, and leverage a leaner cost structure,\u201d said the 5-star analyst. \u201cHowever, regulatory headwinds have grown stronger this year, and we believe the darkest days of this downturn are ahead of us.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nNevertheless, White remains onside, touting a Buy rating along with a $170 price target, implying shares will generate returns of 32% in the months ahead. (To watch White\u2019s track record, click here)\n\nOverall, the bulls are out in heavy attendance for AMZN. Barring a single Hold rating, all 42 other analysts who issued a research report over the last 3 months, recommend the stock as a Buy. With an average price target of $174.67, the analysts foresee further upside of ~36% in the months ahead.

Investors will be closely tuned into the releases as the market looks to extend its 2023 rally into year-end.\n\nPositive results from the bunch would undoubtedly be bullish for the market, particularly if we hear uplifting commentary surrounding current business conditions. Regarding this week\u2019s slate, Amazon AMZN and Meta Platforms META are scheduled to report, representing two of the \u2018Big 7\u2019.\n\nBut how do expectations stack up heading into their respective release? Let\u2019s take a closer look at recent sentiment and a few key metrics as a light guide.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nIt\u2019s been the 'year of efficiency' for Meta Platforms, with the company\u2019s quarterly results in 2023 regularly bringing fireworks post-earnings. The company has exceeded the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by an average of nearly 20% across its last four releases. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAnalysts have been bullish for the upcoming release, with the $3.62 Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate up roughly 5% since the beginning of August. Top line revisions have also been positive, as the $33.4 billion quarterly revenue estimate has moved 1.2% higher during the same period. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMany will be interested in the company\u2019s Reality Labs performance, a segment that includes Meta\u2019s augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) related consumer hardware, software, and content. The segment has come under scrutiny in the past following concerns about its profitability.\n\nNonetheless, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Reality Labs revenue stands at $315 million, suggesting growth of 10.5% from the year-ago period. The company stated in its latest release that it expects Reality Lab operating losses to increase into 2024 as it continues investing to scale its ecosystem.\n\nThe consensus expectation is that the Reality Labs segment will post a $4.1 billion operating loss in Q3, above the $3.7 billion mark in the prior quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that META shares aren\u2019t overly expensive given the forecasted top and bottom line growth, with shares currently trading at a 23.5X forward earnings multiple (F1), in line with the five-year median.\n\nMeta\u2019s earnings are forecasted to climb 38% in its current year (FY23) on 14% higher sales. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAmazon\n\nAmazon\u2019s quarterly results in 2023 have consistently exceeded expectations, beating the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by at least 40% across its last three releases and snapping a streak of negative surprises that started in 2022.\n\nCurrently, the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $0.58 represents 190% growth from the year-ago quarter, with the estimate up a bullish 49% since the beginning of August. In addition, the $141.6 billion quarterly revenue estimate implies growth of 11.6%, being revised 2.5% higher during the same period. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nSimilar to META, Amazon\u2019s quarterly results in 2023 have been aided by a focus on efficiency. Throughout its latest quarter, operating income jumped to $7.7 billion from $3.3 billion in the year-ago period, and operating cash flow increased 74% to $61.8 billion.\n\nIn addition, it\u2019s worth noting that Amazon hosted its biggest-ever Prime Day event earlier in July, with over 375 million items purchased and reflecting a strong consumer.\n\nRegarding Amazon\u2019s key metrics, Amazon Web Services (AWS) results are the common focus among investors. Regarding AWS expectations for the upcoming print, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for AWS Net Sales stands at $23.2 billion, 13% higher than the year-ago figure.\n\nAs shown below, the company has recently exceeded expectations for AWS Net Sales in back-to-back releases. It\u2019s more than reasonable to assume Amazon will discuss AWS results heavily, particularly as investors seek further clarity surrounding enterprise demand. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nMega-cap technology dominates the reporting docket this week, with the likes of Meta Platforms META and Amazon AMZN scheduled to reveal quarterly results.\n\nBoth companies have enjoyed positive top and bottom line estimate revisions, with each also expected to post sizable growth relative to the same period last year.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

However, it should be noted that AMZN stock has languished over the last three years, losing -21% over that period, and underperforming the broad market.\n\nFor discerning investors this should be looked at as an opportunity. Although the stock is down over that period, annual sales have climbed nearly 40%, cloud services has maintained its dominant industry position, and new high margin businesses like Amazon ads have exploded from seemingly nowhere.\n\nThat means the business has grown deeper and wider over that time, while the relative valuation has eased significantly. Furthermore, and most notably, Amazon is projected to grow its EPS faster than any other Mega Cap technology stock over the next 3-5 years. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nEarnings Estimates\n\nEarnings estimates have trended higher for most of 2023, although in the last two months they have been unchanged. This gives Amazon a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), reflecting a mixed earnings revision trend.\n\nNonetheless, sales and earnings are expected to grow at a healthy pace despite the mixed macroeconomic environment. Current quarter sales are forecast to grow 11.4% YoY to $141.65 billion and earnings are projected to climb 190% to $0.58 per share. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMost impressive is its EPS forecasts, which expect Amazon to see earnings grow an average of 29.5% annually over the next 3-5 years. These projections dwarf the expectation of its mega cap tech counterparts, most of which expect growth under 20%. Not that those are anything to balk at, but the figures from Amazon are especially impressive. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAds Sales Surging\n\nOne of the key drivers of sales growth, and the fastest growing segment at Amazon is its relatively new business Amazon Ads. Amazon has quickly grown to be the third largest digital ad platform in the world, behind only Meta Platforms META and Alphabet GOOGL.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe advertising business is expected to bring in $45 billion this year, which is up 21% since last year and more than double since 2020. That is especially compelling because both Meta Platforms and Alphabet have struggled in the last year.\n\nAdditionally, since 2020 Amazon has increased its market share in the digital ad space from 10.3% to 13%. In comparison, Alphabet and Meta Platforms had shares of 28.9% and 25.2%, respectively.\n\nWeb Services\n\nOne of the more impressive feats from Amazon over the last few years is its ability to maintain such a dominant position in the cloud services industry. In what is one of the most competitive, fastest growing, and high margin big businesses in the world, AMZN continues to draw in new customers and hold on to current ones.\n\nToday, Amazon owns a third of the half a trillion-dollar cloud services market, well above competitors Microsoft MSFT (23%) and Alphabet (10%). Although Amazon owns the largest market share in cloud computing, it is also the slowest growing. Last quarter AWS grew sales 12% YoY, while Microsoft grew them 15%, and Alphabet 28% YoY. Statista\n\nImage Source: Statista\n\nValuation\n\nAs noted earlier, because of the lackluster three-year performance of AMZN stock, its earnings multiple has fallen off its highs and is well below its historic median.\n\nToday it is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 56.7x, below the 10-year median of 113x, and very near its low of 50.5x. And this is all right as its earnings begin a period of acceleration. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nAmazon is by far one the best performing stocks in the market, as well as the broadest and most solid business model out there. Its stock has compounded at 21% annually over the last 25 years adding up to a cumulative return of 12,000%.\n\nThe company continues to execute at the highest level \u2013 entering new markets like ads, controlling cloud services and e-commerce, and will dramatically boost profits in the near future. Because of this I think Amazon is an extremely convincing investment, whether you buy it before or after earnings.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company faces headwinds from \"choppy\" mall-retail traffic and key brand allocation shifts like Nike (NKE), the firm tells investors in a research note. Piper Sandler downgraded Monster Beverage(MNST) to Neutral from Overweight with a price target of $50, down from $63. The firm says Monster's near-term and long-term growth momentum \"look likely to lag historical levels.\" JPMorgan downgraded Bath & Body Works(BBWI) to Underweight from Neutral with a price target of $27, down from $41. The firm says the combination of moderating same-store-sales relative to pre-pandemic comp growth, ongoing separation-related investments, and pressure as the model returns to a normalized cadence of promotions present potential earnings headwinds. Daiwa downgraded Enphase Energy (ENPH) to Neutral from Outperform with a price target of $100, down from $145. The firm believes inventory destocking will continue into the first half of 2024. Morgan Stanley downgraded FMC Corporation (FMC) to Equal Weight from Overweight with a price target of $70, down from $100. The severity of the company's sales and EBITDA rebase resets risk/reward balance and no longer provides suitable base case upside for an Overweight rating, the firm tells investors in a research note.\n\nStory continues Amazon's new MK30 Prime Air drone.

The company has industry-leading scale, a conservative balance sheet, and expected growth outperformance versus industry averages through 2025, the firm argues. Loop Capital initiated coverage of Trade Desk (TTD) with a Buy rating and $95 price target. The firm views Trade Desk as one of the best long-term growth opportunities available to technology and media investors today. Wells Fargo initiated coverage of Extra Space Storage(EXR) with an Underweight rating and $115 price target. The firm sees elevated near-term risks from the LSI integration, and says recent declines in Street rates puts pressure on estimates for 2023 and 2024. KeyBanc initiated coverage of Criteo (CRTO) with an Overweight rating and $40 price target.

It will also facilitate effortless exploration of fresh programming with an integrated, content-centric interface and voice-activated remote.\r\n\r\nThis streaming device is driven by Comcast's EntertainmentOS, a fresh entertainment platform designed to simplify content discovery, regardless of its source. Entertainment OS is the result of CMCSA's extensive content aggregation expertise, merging the cutting-edge UI technology of Sky Glass with the search and discovery capabilities found in platforms like Xfinity X1 and Xfinity Flex.\n\nXumo Enters Into a Competitive Streaming Device Market\n\nStreaming is a method employed to distribute content to a range of devices, including computers, laptops, tablets and mobile devices, via the Internet. This technology typically conveys data through both audio and video formats. Additionally, it facilitates the linkage of televisions or home theaters to the Internet, enabling the streaming of video and music from online services.\r\n\r\nAccording to a Report Linker report, the global streaming media devices market is expected to reach $14.42 billion in 2023 from $12.31 billion in 2022 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.1%. The streaming media devices market is expected to reach $26.84 billion by 2027 at a CAGR of 16.8%.\r\n\r\nThe streaming device market has some prominent players like Roku ROKU, Amazon AMZN and Apple AAPL.\r\n\r\nRoku has an interface to navigate and includes all the major streaming services. The most recent model is the 4K Plus. Customers find the stick appealing due to its affordability and improved performance, along with a longer-range wireless receiver. The stick easily connects to the TV's HDMI port, eliminating any dangling cables.\r\n\r\nAmazon\u2019s second-generation Fire Stick 4K Max is the ideal choice for users primarily watching Amazon Prime content. It offers access to major streaming apps and its design is clearly oriented toward enhancing the Amazon Prime experience. Notably, a new Ambient Experience feature has been introduced, which displays and cycles through artwork or natural scenes.\r\n\r\nApple TVs come with a higher price tag and justify the high price by providing an extensive content library. These devices feature an elegant user interface and offer impressive capabilities, such as the ability to simultaneously play audio on two sets of AirPods without disturbing the room's quietness. They also enable co-watching movies with a friend via FaceTime. The latest model incorporates HDR10+ support, ensuring the most vibrant and lifelike colors.\r\n\r\nComcast already owns a streaming device Xfinity, which already has experience in the streaming device market.

The report will also provide fresh insights into whether Google\u2019s recent AI advancements are driving revenue for the company\u2019s cloud and enterprise businesses.\n\nThe announcement comes as Google is battling two antitrust suits filed by the Department of Justice accusing the company of abusing its power and distorting competition in the online search and digital advertising markets.\n\nRevenue excluding traffic acquisition costs for the third quarter is expected to come in at $63 billion, a 10% jump from the same time last year when the company brought in $57.3 billion. Analysts are also expecting adjusted earnings per share of $1.44, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

(AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nGoogle has been pouring money into its generative AI efforts after being caught off guard by Microsoft, which began rolling the technology into its products in February after investing in AI company OpenAI. Since then, Google has debuted a host of generative AI products for both its consumer and enterprise businesses, as it seeks to regain its standing as Silicon Valley\u2019s AI leader. Now investors want to see how that rollout is paying off.\n\nThe company also released its latest smartphones earlier this month, putting a heavy focus on its AI capabilities including adding foundational AI models to the phones themselves.\n\nGoogle\u2019s cloud business, meanwhile, is expected to take in $8.6 billion in the quarter, up 25.3% year-over-year. But that growth is slowing. The company posted cloud revenue growth of 37.6% in Q3 2022, 32% in Q4 2022, 28.1% in Q1 2023, and 28% in Q2 2023.\n\nGoogle is working to slice away at rival Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft\u2019s (MSFT) shares of the cloud computing market.

Analysts expect revenue of $58.9 billion from the segment, up 8.1% year-over-year. That would mark a solid improvement in ad revenue, which has been slowly improving since Google reported negative growth in the business in Q4 2022.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoogle, and advertising industry rival Meta (META), are seen as bellwethers for the industry, so any negative performance could have a dramatic impact on shares of other digital ad firms.\n\nGoogle, however, is facing a slew of regulatory problems. Not only is it battling the DOJ over its search and ad businesses, the European Commission is also working to break up the company\u2019s ad segment. Then there\u2019s Japan\u2019s antitrust watchdog, which is investigating whether Google asked smartphone makers to favor search products over competing services, according to Bloomberg.\n\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

Unfortunately, relatively higher costs have prevented hydrogen energy from receiving as much investment as solar and wind projects. The\u00a0Inflation Reduction Act passed by the Biden Administration in 2022 provides both tax incentives and subsidies to clean energy projects, and this piece of legislation had initially caused investors to give hydrogen stocks another look.\n\nHowever, now that we are in the second half of 2023, some equity investors have become impatient with the deteriorating near-term earnings potential of some hydrogen companies. The Global X Hydrogen ETF (NASDAQ:HYDR), for example, has fallen 42.4% year-to-date.\n\nDespite this, with hydrogen stocks reaching new lows and while energy prices are likely to continue upward due to broader geopolitical events, it may be a good time to consider what hydrogen stocks to buy. Below are three of my suggestions.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBallard Power Systems (BLDP) Ballard Power Systems Inc logo visible on display screen\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nFor those already familiar with the hydrogen stock space, Ballard Power Systems (NASDAQ:BLDP) has to already be on their buying list. For those unfamiliar, Ballard is a pioneer in the hydrogen fuel cell industry. The company primarily develops proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell products and has been for more than 30 years. These fuel cells help generate reliable electricity for various applications, such as buses, trucks, trains, ships, and backup power systems.\n\nBallard Power Systems has been gaining traction in the global market, as more countries and companies are adopting hydrogen as a green alternative to fossil fuels. That does not mean there have not been any macro hurdles to overcome.\n\nThe fuel cell company has been impacted by slumping demand in certain international markets, particularly in Europe and China, where hydrogen fuel cell demand has fallen due to slumping economic growth in both regions. These short-term headwinds are likely to diminish as the global economy picks up steam and hydrogen demand recovers. Solaris Bus & Coach, a Polish manufacturer of public transportation vehicles, recently ordered 177 hydrogen fuel cells from Ballard, suggesting there is still demand for their product.\n\nStory continues\n\nPotential investors should get excited for what is to come.\n\nBloom Energy (BE) An image of a hydrogen fuel pipeline running through a grassy field, with wind turbines and solar panels in the background. top hydrogen stocks to buy\n\nSource: petrmalinak / Shutterstock\n\nBloom Energy (NYSE:BE) is another pure-play innovator in the hydrogen industry. The company specializes in solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) technology, which can generate electricity from various fuels, including natural gas, biogas, and hydrogen. The \u201cBloom Energy Server,\u201d in essence, produces electricity through an electrochemical process.\n\nThis reduces the need for combustion and thereby reduces emissions. Bloom\u2019s Energy Server can provide reliable, 24/7 power, making them an attractive option for businesses and institutions that require constant power supply. The server also operates independently of the grid. This can be a crucial advantage during power outages or in areas with unstable grid infrastructure.\n\nBloom Energy had been impressing investors in the last few years with its financial performance and product innovation. In 2022, the\u00a0company posted a record revenue of $1.2 billion, up 23% year-over-year, and a gross margin of 21%. In July, Bloom Energy announced the groundbreaking launch of Series 10, 10MW fuel cell offering.\n\nWhile shares have fallen 40.8% year-to-date, Wall Street analysts are still projecting a 102.1% upside, which could put potential investors in a good spot if they invest now.\n\nPlug Power (PLUG) Person holding mobile phone with logo of American hydrogen fuel cell company Plug Power Inc. (PLUIG) on screen in front of webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nPlug Power (NASDAQ: PLUG) is the largest supplier of liquid hydrogen, and the company produces hydrogen fuel cells for mobility applications. In particular, Plug Power\u2019s hydrogen fuel cells mainly service supply chain and logistics industries, providing hydrogen-powered forklifts, trucks, buses and drones.\n\nAs fuel costs move upward, alternative energy sources, especially for powering industrial vehicles, can save immense costs and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the long run. The hydrogen fuel cell developer has successfully formed several strategic partnerships with major players in the mobility and logistics sector. This includes Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Walmart (NYSE:WMT), and Airbus (OTCPK:EADSY).\n\nPlug Power\u2019s shares are down 50.6%, despite beating revenue estimates consecutively in 2023. Investors have definitely grown impatient. While shares trade around 2.1 times forward revenue, investors interested in investing in the burgeoning hydrogen market should take notice.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Amazon AMZN, GoDaddy GDDY, Carrier Global CARR and Itron ITRI.\n\nHere are highlights from Monday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\nWhat to Expect Ahead of Amazon's Q3 Earnings Release\n\nAmazon is scheduled to report third-quarter 2023 results on Oct 26.\n\nFor the third quarter, Amazon expects revenues in the band of $138-$143 billion. Net sales are expected to grow 9-13% from the year-ago quarter's reported figure.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sales is pegged at $141.61 billion, indicating growth of 11.4% from the prior-year quarter's reported figure.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings is pegged at 58 cents per share, significantly up from 20 cents reported in the year-ago quarter.\n\nEarnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed the same once, the average surprise being 40.96%.\n\nPrime, Retail & Streaming Momentum to Note\n\nAmazon's solid Prime momentum, along with its strengthening distribution network, are expected to have aided online retail business' performance in the third quarter.\n\nPrime benefits, including a strong loyalty system, customer-friendly offers, quick grocery delivery services and robust Prime Free One-Day and Prime Free Same-Day Delivery services, are expected to have aided Amazon's customer momentum in the quarter under review.\n\nAMZN's strong performance during its mega shopping event Prime Day, conducted at the beginning of the third quarter, is likely to have driven sales in the to-be-reported quarter.\n\nThe introduction of the Buy with Prime app for Shopify, which enables Prime members to avail of various Prime benefits like quick and free delivery and easy returns while shopping from Shopify stores or merchants, might have been a plus.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for online store sales is pegged at $57.16 billion, reflecting growth of 6.9% from the year-ago reported figure.\n\nThis apart, strengthening relationships with third-party sellers on the back of solid solution offerings might have remained a positive. The consensus mark for sales generated by third-party sellers is pegged at $33.43 billion, reflecting growth of 16.6% from the figure reported in the prior-year quarter.\n\nAMZN's growing efforts in grocery retail are expected to have benefited its quarterly performance.\n\nSolid momentum across the company's Fresh grocery stores across the United States is anticipated to have contributed well to AMZN's grocery sales in the third quarter. A solid network of Whole Foods Store and Amazon Go stores might have driven the company's physical store sales.\n\nThe consensus mark for the third quarter's physical store sales is pegged at $5.02 billion, indicating growth of 7% from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe strength of Prime Video is expected to have contributed well. Expanding original content, regional content and the overall content portfolio on Prime Video are expected to have driven the Prime subscription in the to-be-reported quarter.\n\nWe expect retail perks associated with Prime, along with strength in Prime Video, are likely to have continued aiding Amazon's subscription revenue growth in the quarter under review. Also, the growing momentum in Amazon Music might have been a positive.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for subscription service sales is pegged at $10.12 billion, reflecting growth of 13.6% from the year-ago reported figure.\n\nAWS Portfolio Momentum to Consider\n\nAmazon's expanding Amazon Web Services (\"AWS\") portfolio is expected to have benefited its third-quarter performance.\n\nIn the quarter under review, AWS expanded Amazon Bedrock, a fully managed foundation model (\"FM\") service. It added Cohere as an FM provider to Bedrock. It also added the latest FMs from Anthropic and Stability AI, namely Claude 2 and Stable Diffusion XL 1.0, respectively, to Bedrock.\n\nThe company announced the general availability of AWS Entity Resolution, which enables organizations to analyze, match and link related records stored across various applications, channels and data stores seamlessly.\n\nIt also unveiled a new HIPAA-eligible service called AWS HealthScribe, powered by speech recognition and generative AI technology.\n\nWe expect all these initiatives to have helped Amazon win customers. This, in turn, is expected to have boosted AWS's third-quarter revenues, whose consensus mark is pinned at $23.19 billion, up 12.9% from the year-ago reported figure.\n\nSmart Device Portfolio Strength\n\nAmazon's strengthening Echo device family might have contributed well. It expanded its Echo devices' lineup by introducing Echo Show 8, Echo Hub and Echo Frames during the quarter under review.\n\nThe firm boosted its Fire TV family with the all-new Fire TV Stick 4K Max, Fire TV Stick 4K and Fire TV Soundbar. It also introduced an upgraded Fire TV experience with generative AI.\n\nThis apart, AMZN expanded its mesh WiFi system offerings with the launch of eero Max 7. Also, Amazon launched Blink Outdoor 4 to expand its smart camera offerings.\n\nAll the above-mentioned factors are expected to have aided AMZN's quarterly performance.\n\nHowever, the impacts of rising inflationary pressure and unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations might be reflected in the upcoming results.\n\nWhat Our Model Says\n\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Amazon this time around.

ROVR.\n\nHere are highlights from Monday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\n5 Online Retailers to Buy on Solid Sales in September\n\nOn Oct 17, the Department of Commerce reported that retail sales in September increased 0.7% month over month, significantly beating the consensus estimate of 0.3%. Moreover, the metric for August was revised upward to an increase of 0.8% from 0.6% reported earlier. Within overall retail sales, online sales grew 1.1% in September, second only to a 3% jump in miscellaneous store retailers.\n\nInternet - Commerce continues to evolve as the technologies driving it advance. On the one side are increasingly powerful and capable user devices. On the other are sophisticated, AI-enabled software platforms facilitating transactions more capable of delivering user satisfaction.\n\nDifferentiation comes from better technology for improved showcasing, easier navigation and payment, speedier delivery and returns, brand building, comparison shopping, loyalty, etc., as well as more shipping options, which generally tip the scales in favor of larger players.\n\nWithin the Retail sector, the Zacks-defined Internet-Commerce industry is currently in the top 37% of the Zacks Industry Rank. Year to date, the industry has provided 32% returns. Since it is ranked in the top half of Zacks Ranked Industries, we expect the e-commerce industry to outperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months.\n\nOur Top Picks\n\nWe have narrowed our search to five e-commerce stocks with strong potential for 2024.

Getty Images/Observer\n\nIt\u2019s Big Tech earnings season, this year against the backdrop of a volatile stock market and uncertain economy. Investors will look for key financial updates from the tech giants that have fueled the rebound of S&P 500 so far in 2023 and, more importantly, what their leaders think the future holds\u2014for both their companies and the economy.\n\nGoogle (GOOGL) parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Meta, Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) are all scheduled to report financial results for the three months ended September this week. Expectations for outperformance are high; of the 86 companies in the S&P 500 index that have reported third-quarter earnings so far, 78 percent have beat analysts\u2019 estimates, according to the LSEG data reported by Reuters. And after the financial release, CEOs and CFOs will answer investors\u2019 questions on earnings calls.\n\nHere are the questions Big Tech CEOs are expected to address in Q3 \u201923 earnings:\n\nAlphabet: How is the antitrust trial going?\n\nGoogle parent Alphabet is scheduled to report earnings tomorrow (Oct. 24). Investors are eager to hear CEO Sundar Pichai give an update on the company\u2019s ongoing legal battle against the U.S. government.\n\nThe Department of Justice sued Alphabet for squashing competition in a historic antitrust suit in 2020, and the trial finally began earlier this month. The government alleges that Alphabet crushed competitors in online search by forming exclusionary deals with smartphone makers, like Apple, that make Google the default search engine on their devices. Alphabet has argued that it simply has a superior product. So far, access to the trial is sporadic as the court keeps a lot of sensitive business information confidential.\n\nGoogle faces similar antitrust probes in its major foreign markets, too. Today (Oct. 23), the Japanese government launched an investigation into Google\u2019s ties with Android phone makers over search engine deals. The outcomes of these probes could drastically change the global online search market.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead Also: Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella: Google\u2019s Deal With Apple Is \u2018Oligopolistic\u2019\n\nMicrosoft: Is the $10 billion OpenAI investment paying off?\n\nMicrosoft will also report earnings on Oct. 24. CEO Satya Nadella will likely field questions on the company\u2019s progress in artificial intelligence, which he has made a cornerstone of Microsoft\u2019s business strategy. In the past year, Microsoft has committed to a $10 billion investment in OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, and incorporated OpenAI\u2019s advanced language models in the Bing search engine and Edge browser. Investors want to know how well those investments are paying off.\n\nMeta: What comes after the \u201cyear of efficiency\u201d? And is anyone using Threads yet?\n\nMeta will report earnings on the same day as Microsoft (Oct. 25). At the beginning of the year, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said 2023 would be the \u201cyear of efficiency\u201d marked by cost cuts and cautious spending. The measures worked; Meta\u2019s stock price is up more than 150 percent this year, beating every Big Tech peer. As 2023 draws to a close, is Zuckerberg considering new product investments and hiring again for 2024?\n\nInvestors also want to know whether Threads, Meta\u2019s text-based platform to compete with Elon Musk\u2019s X, retained users over the past quarter. At Meta\u2019s last quarterly earnings call, Zuckerberg admitted Threads saw many challenges following its explosive debut, and his team was working hard to keep users on the platform.\n\nApple: How is the iPhone 15 selling? Should investors worry about China\u2019s probe into Foxconn?\n\nApple is scheduled to report earnings on Oct. 26. A central item will be the initial market reaction to the iPhone 15 lineup launched in September. iPhone sales make up more than half of Apple\u2019s total revenue. So, early iPhone 15 sales data will gauge Apple\u2019s financial soundness in the current quarter and next year.\n\nCEO Tim Cook may also be pressed to answer questions about a new probe in China into Apple\u2019s largest supplier, Taiwan\u2019s Foxconn, and whether it could affect Apple\u2019s production. Foxconn has many factories in mainland China. The Chinese government could exert a considerable impact on Apple\u2019s supply chain, as seen during the country\u2019s Covid lockdown in 2022.\n\nAmazon: Is Andy Jassy\u2019s ambitious return-to-office mandate working?\n\nAlso reporting earnings on Thursday is Amazon. Like some Big Tech peers, Amazon will face questions about its game plans in A.I. and antitrust concerns. Last month, the Federal Trade Commission and 17 states sued the e-commerce giant for using its monopolistic power in online retail to charge high prices. CEO Andy Jassy may be asked about his latest effort to bring employees back to the office. Earlier this week, reports surfaced that Amazon managers were given permission to fire any employees who fail to report to the office at least three days a week.\n\nTrending Observer Stories\n\nMartin Scorsese's Strengths Seem Wasted in 'Killers of the Flower Moon' What to Watch on Streaming This Week: October 20-26 Jet Set: The Best Travel Tote Bags 10 Extraordinary UNESCO Sites to Explore Across America X Continues to Lose Users\u2014And It Could Be a Problem for Elon Musk's Subscription Plan\n\nRead the original story Big Tech Q3 Earnings: Top Questions for the CEOs of Google, Meta, Apple, Amazon and others by Sissi Cao at Observer.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-tech-q3-earnings-top-005842811.html", "symbols": ["AMZ.F", "AMZ.XETRA", "AMZN.MX", "AMZN.US", "AMZO34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.942, "neg": 0.043, "neu": 0.886, "pos": 0.071}}, {"date": "2023-10-24T00:23:01+00:00", "title": "These 2 \u2018Magnificent Seven\u2019 Stocks Have up to 155% Upside Potential, Analysts Say", "content": "Recent months have seen increased volatility in the stock markets, as both the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ have given back some of the gains they posted earlier in the year. Stocks are coming under pressure from a variety of headwinds \u2013 but one that stands out recently comes from the bond market.\n\nTreasury bond yields and stocks tend to move in opposite directions, and earlier today the 10-year treasury bond rose to a peak of 5.02%, its highest level since July 2007. The yield was as low as 3.3% as recently as this past April, and has been rising steadily ever since.\n\nContrarian market expert Jim Cramer has been watching current conditions, and he sees the \u2018Magnificent Seven,\u2019 the seven largest stocks in the S&P 500, as the ultimate defensive plays in this environment.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in an unusual situation, but skyrocketing bond yields are bad news for the vast bulk of the market. The mega-cap techs are the one big exception. You want to make it through this difficult moment? You need the Magnificent Seven, and then the rest,\u201d Cramer opined.\n\nWith this in mind, we used the TipRanks database to pull up the details on two of these \u2018Magnificent Seven\u2019 stocks to find out what makes them compelling buys. According to the platform, both have received plenty of love from Wall Street analysts, earning a \u2018Strong Buy\u2019 consensus rating and are projected to have up to 155% upside potential for the year ahead.\n\nNvidia Corporation(NVDA)\n\nWe\u2019ll start with the semiconductor chip giant Nvidia. This is a well-known name, a leader in the chip markets whose products, particularly the high-end GPUs, are in high demand for AI applications, data centers, and high-end gaming. Since last November when ChatGPT woke everyone up to the potentialities of AI, Nvidia has seen that demand rise and continue to rise; the stock is up an impressive 194% since the beginning of this year, and Nvidia boasts a market cap of $1.06 trillion.\n\nThe company\u2019s success has been powered by strong growth in its AI-related products. Nvidia has, since 2020, been a leader in the supply of GPU chips to OpenAI, the Microsoft-supported firm behind ChatGPT. OpenAI, already a heavy buyer of Nvidia chips, has said it will require as many as 10,000 new GPU chips heading into 2024, in order to maintain the chatbot\u2019s performance parameters. Having a ready customer with high demand has given a boost to Nvidia\u2019s revenues and earnings in recent months.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat can be readily seen in the chip company\u2019s most recent quarterly earnings report, from fiscal 2Q24. For that quarter, Nvidia reported $13.5 billion in quarterly revenue \u2013 a result that was a company record, a 101% year-over-year gain, and was $2.43 billion ahead of the forecasts. The company\u2019s bottom line, reported in non-GAAP measures, came to $2.70 per diluted share, beating the estimates by 61 cents per share. The results were driven by solid performance in the AI-adjacent data center segment, which was up 171% y/y to reach $10.32 billion in total revenue.\n\nThe Street\u2019s analysts are anticipating more gains for Nvidia next month when it reports its fiscal Q3 earnings. The forecast for revenue is $15.89 billion, and the outlook for the non-GAAP EPS is $3.36 per share.\n\nFor 5-star analyst Hans Mosesmann, from Rosenblatt Securities, the company\u2019s AI and data center exposure are key supports. He writes of the stock, \u201cNVDA remains our top conviction idea\u2026 With data center and AI inferencing opportunities massive and most of the $1 trillion server market shifting to accelerated computing, NVDA is poised for multi-year growth as supply expands. New platforms like Hopper, L40S, and Grace-Hopper will drive further inflections\u2026 NVDA\u2019s unmatched software capabilities and exposure to secular AI and data center tailwinds reinforce its position as a top secular grower even amidst competition.\u201d\n\nFor Mosesmann, this adds up to a Buy rating on the share, and his Street-high $1,100 price target implies that a robust one-year gain of ~155% lies on the horizon for Nvidia. (To watch Mosesmann\u2019s track record, click here)\n\nOverall, the Strong Buy consensus on NVDA is based on 38 recent analyst reviews \u2013 and they are nearly unanimous, with 37 Buys against a single Hold. The shares have a selling price of $429.75 and their average price target, at $645.53, suggests a 12-month upside potential of 50%. (See Nvidia stock forecast)\n\nAmazon(AMZN)\n\nThe next mega-cap tech firm we\u2019ll look at is Amazon, one of the world\u2019s truly iconic brands. Amazon\u2019s ubiquitous smile logo has become synonymous with rapid delivery, as the company has cemented its position over the past decade as the world leader in e-commerce and online retail. Amazon survived the dot.com bubble more than 20 years ago and has built on that, remaking itself as the one-stop-shop for everything online. Today, Amazon boasts a market cap of $1.29 trillion, and its online retail activity saw approximately $690 billion in gross merchandise volume last year.\n\nAmazon\u2019s online retail service may be the 800-pound gorilla in the room, but the company\u2019s other divisions give it a depth and breadth that can insulate the company from most shocks. Amazon Web Services is a major player in the cloud computing world, and the company\u2019s AI-powered technology products show tremendous promise; these include AWS, which the company is working to integrate with AI, and other AI products include a software code development tool, an image-building platform, and a chatbot. Amazon clearly has the resources to develop all of these avenues simultaneously; the company\u2019s cash holdings may have declined by 8% from the end of 2022 to the end of 2Q23, but it still had $49.5 billion in liquid assets on hand at the end of Q2.\n\nIn other Q2 metrics, Amazon reported sky-high revenue of $134.4 billion, a figure that was up 11% year over year and came in $3 billion better than expectations. The firm\u2019s bottom line, at 65 cents per share, was 31 cents ahead of estimates. Amazon\u2019s Q2 earnings showed a benefit from a non-operating expense gain in the company\u2019s Rivian equity holdings, where the prior year\u2019s equivalent figure had been a loss of $3.9 billion.\n\nAmazon will report its Q3 results later this week, and analysts are looking to see a 59-cent EPS based on $141.6 billion in revenues.\n\nAmong the bulls is Evercore analyst Greg Melich who believes that Amazon is a go-to story for investors, and outlines why: \u201cWe are keeping AMZN on our Tactical Outperform list, and AMZN remains our #2 pick among Large Cap \u2018Nets\u2026 We believe the AMZN Long Thesis is very well intact. AMZN still faces several very large $T TAMs; benefits from a very positive mix shift to faster growth/higher margin AWS and Ads revenue streams; has very strong competitive positions in Retail, Cloud & Advertising; has a very powerful business model in terms of Growth & FCF generation; and has a very competent management team. Among our coverage space, AMZN is arguably the strongest, most successfully diversified company.\u201d\n\nTo this end, Melich rates AMZN an Outperform (i.e. Buy), with a $190 price target that indicates his confidence in a 50% potential gain heading into next year. (To watch Melich\u2019s track record, click here)\n\nOverall, this behemoth of a company has picked up no fewer than 42 recent analyst reviews; their lopsided 41 to 1 split in favor of Buys over Holds gives AMZN its Strong Buy consensus rating. The shares have an average price target of $175.38, implying an upside of ~38%.
