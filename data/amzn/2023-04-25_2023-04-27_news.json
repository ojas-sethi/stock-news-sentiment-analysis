We're working to build customer relationships and a business that will outlast all of us.\"\n\nAmazon stock popped as much as 10% late Thursday as investors digested revenues, profits, margins, and current quarter guidance that all blew past Wall Street's expectations.\n\nHere are the headline numbers from Amazon's report, compared to analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg:\n\nNet sales: $127.36 actual versus $124.7 billion estimated EPS: 31 cents actual versus 20 cents estimated Amazon Web Services (AWS) net sales: $21.35 billion actual versus $21.03 billion estimated Operating margin: 3.7% actual versus 2.38% estimated Q2 net sales guidance: $127 billion - $133 billion actual versus $130.1 billion estimated\n\nStory continues\n\n\"There\u2019s a lot to like about how our teams are delivering for customers, particularly amidst an uncertain economy,\" Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said in the earnings statement.\n\nThe company's efforts to rein in costs, which ran Amazon about $500 million in the first quarter, are expected to be a central focus on the company's earnings call Thursday evening. The company announced plans to lay off a total of 27,000 employees over the last few months.\n\n\"Our Stores business is continuing to improve the cost to serve in our fulfillment network while increasing the speed with which we get products into the hands of customers (we expect to have our fastest Prime delivery speeds ever in 2023),\" Jassy said.\n\n\"Our Advertising business continues to deliver robust growth, largely due to our ongoing machine learning investments that help customers see relevant information when they engage with us, which in turn delivers unusually strong results for brands.\"\n\nOn the company's earnings call, both Jassy and Olsavsky also spoke about the still-wary customer, both on the e-commerce and AWS sides of the business.\n\n\"We saw moderated spending on discretionary categories as well as shifts to lower-priced items and healthy demand in everyday essentials, such as consumables and beauty,\" said Olsavsky.\n\nThis in some ways mirrors what Amazon is seeing among cloud customers, Jassy added.\n\n\"In AWS, what we're seeing is enterprises continuing to be cautious in their spending in this uncertain time,\" he told analysts. \"Customers are looking for ways to save money however they can right now. They tell us that most of it is cost-optimizing versus cost-cutting, which is an interesting distinction because they say they're cost optimizing to reallocate those resources on new customer experiences.\" AWS CEO Andy Jassy, discusses a new initiative with the NFL that will transform player health and safety using cloud computing during AWS re:Invent 2019 on Thursday, Dec. 5, 2019 in Las Vegas. (Isaac Brekken/AP Images for NFL)\n\nMuch of the initial excitement around Amazon's quarter, however, can be seen in the growth that returned to some parts of the business.\n\nIn its North America retail operations, for instance, the company's gone back to making money. This time last year, the segment was operating at a loss of more than $1.5 billion in the three months leading up to March 31, 2022. This year, this segment reported operating income of $898 million.\n\nAnother case in point: Last year, in Q1 2022, online stores sales declined 1% year-over-year. In the first quarter of this year, sales rose 3%.\n\nAllie Garfinkle is a Senior Tech Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

But they're understanding as well the intricacies of how they need to communicate with the street in underpromising and overdelivering. And I think the call out on AWS.

Shares shot up over +10% initially on the news, but have since pulled back to around +7% in after-hours trading.\r\n\r\nThe company topped expectations pretty much across the board: Amazon Web Services (AWS \u2014 its cloud computing component) came in at $21.4 billion versus $21.1 billion expected.

Advertising reached $9.5 billion versus $9.1 billion consensus.\r\n\r\nWe see margins holding up nicely for the e-commerce leader, with guidance raised for Q2 revenues and Operating Income. The company also reported a -10% contraction in company headcount year over year; Amazon now has about 1.47 million employees. Shares continue to outperform the Nasdaq overall, +28% year to date, after a very sluggish full-year 2022.\r\n\r\nIntel INTC also put up improvements over expectations, with a bottom line of -$0.04 per share 4x better than the -$0.16 per share anticipated on revenues of $11.72 billion in the quarter surpassing the $11.01 billion in the Zacks consensus (though still down -36% year over year). Data Center came in higher at $3.7 billion, and the Client Computing Group posted a big beat: $5.8 billion versus $4.9 billion expected. But negative quarterly earnings guidance for Q2 helped move shares from +3% to the positive in late trading to -1.2% at this hour.\r\n\r\nBy far the biggest disappointment among late traders was Snap SNAP following its Q1 release: earnings of +$0.01 per share swung to a positive from -$0.01 expected, but sales of $989 million missed expectations of $1.01 billion by -7% \u2014its first year-over-year revenue decline in its publicly traded existence \u2014 with Q2 revenue guidance brought down as well.

This compares to earnings of $0.21 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 47.62%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this online retailer would post earnings of $0.15 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.21, delivering a surprise of 40%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.\n\nAmazon , which belongs to the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, posted revenues of $127.36 billion for the quarter ended March 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.07%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $116.44 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nAmazon shares have added about 25% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 5.6%.\n\nWhat's Next for Amazon?\n\nWhile Amazon has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nStory continues\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Amazon: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.28 on $129.38 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $1.37 on $555.43 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Internet - Commerce is currently in the top 31% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nOne other stock from the same industry, Expedia (EXPE), is yet to report results for the quarter ended March 2023. The results are expected to be released on May 4.\n\nThis online travel company is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.04 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +91.7%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nExpedia's revenues are expected to be $2.68 billion, up 19.3% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

PC revenue for the quarter fell 38%, while datacenter revenue dropped $39%.\n\nIntel is undergoing a turnaround plan spearheaded by CEO Pat Gelsinger as the company aims to regain market share.\n\nYear-to-date Intel shares are up 12%.\n\nInes is a senior business reporter for Yahoo Finance.

We've got Amazon, Snap, Pinterest, and Intel. To kick it off with Amazon, we're looking at gains of just over 7% and a solid report here from the company. AWS coming in slightly better than expected. Also, overall revenue beating The Street's expectations, also giving upbeat outlook. We know Amazon has certainly been off to a strong start this year. Shares climbing just about 30%.\n\nThey also made some comments here about AI. That's certainly been the theme so far of this earnings season in tech, their foray into AI, how exactly they're incorporating AI into their AWS efforts. So that, I'm sure, will be one of the focal points on the call this afternoon. But again, year to date, we're looking at shares up just about 30%.\n\nMoving on down to Snap, that stock under pressure here in extended trading. We're looking at losses of about 18% right now. Certainly a very tough ad environment, and that is certainly having an impact on Snap here. Sales falling for the first time as a public company, their revenue declining 7% on a year-over-year basis.\n\nSnap saying that they do continue to see demand disruption when it comes to advertising and that it is going to take some time for some advertisers to recover here. Year to date, we're looking at gains of just about 17%. The after hours action though would wipe out the gains for the year.\n\nLet's move on down to Pinterest. That stock also under pressure here in extended trading, off just about 9%. The company saying that it sees 2Q revenue growth in line with what we saw in the first quarter, what we saw at the end of the fourth quarter. That was not what The Street was looking for. Again, putting some pressure here in extended trading. Average revenue per user, that also declined 1% on a year-over-year basis, also slightly missing The Street's expectations, coming in at $1.32. Year to date, the stock had been up just about 12%.\n\nAnd rounding it out with Intel, that stock now off just about 1% here in extended trading. We just talked to Angelo Zino of CFRA, and he did say that the report did clear a bar, but it was a very, very low bar. So wasn't too impressed by the numbers here.\n\nAngelo also pointed out that the guidance was a bit worrisome. So that's why we're seeing some pressure here in extended trading. Now, when it comes to Intel and the recovery that The Street has been waiting for for quite some time, Intel did say that they do expect a modest recovery in the second half of the year. Year to date, up just about 13% [INAUDIBLE].", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/video/stocks-moving-hours-amazon-snap-205620693.html", "symbols": ["1SI.F", "1SI.XETRA", "AMZ.F", "AMZ.XETRA", "AMZN.MX", "AMZN.US", "AMZO34.SA", "INL.F", "INL.XETRA", "INTC.MX", "INTC.US", "ITLC34.SA", "PINS.US", "SNAP.US"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": -0.412, "neg": 0.055, "neu": 0.885, "pos": 0.06}}, {"date": "2023-04-27T20:47:22+00:00", "title": "Amazon shares jump as it bucks inflation crisis to post best profit in over a year", "content": "Amazon posted its best profit in more than a year - FASSBENDER/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nAmazon shares jumped on Thursday after the online retail giant bucked a global inflation crisis to post its best profit in more than a year.\n\nThe online retail giant said sales had climbed by 9pc in the first quarter of the year to $127.4bn (\u00a3102bn), above the company\u2019s own financial forecasts.\n\nIt recorded a profit of $3.2bn, compared to a $3.8bn loss in the same period a year ago.\n\nIt was the company\u2019s strongest quarterly profit since 2021, suggesting the world\u2019s biggest online retailer has turned a corner on a punishing post-pandemic slowdown in online shopping, which has been exacerbated by a cost of living crisis.\n\nAmazon shares jumped by more than 10pc in after-hours trading as the figures beat expectations.\n\nHowever, the company reported another decline in its powerhouse cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS). Chief executive Andy Jassy said companies were \u201cspending more cautiously in this macro environment\u201d.\n\nRevenues at AWS grew by 16pc in the first three months of the year, down from 20pc in the previous quarter and 28pc in the three months before that. Chief executive Andy Jassy said companies were \u201cspending more cautiously\" as Amazon Web Services reported further declines - David Paul Morris/Bloomberg\n\nAmazon\u2019s booming advertising business, which has helped ease pressure on its online shopping division, grew by 23pc.\n\nMr Jassy took control of Amazon in 2021 when the company\u2019s founder Jeff Bezos stepped down as chief executive. Mr Bezos remains the company\u2019s executive chairman and its biggest shareholder, owning around 10pc of the $1.1 trillion company.\n\nUnder Mr Jassy\u2019s tenure, sales have slowed as the lockdown shopping boom loses momentum and a downturn in tech valuations has sent the company\u2019s share price tumbling.\n\nThe company hired rapidly during the pandemic and invested heavily in new distribution centres. But this year Mr Jassy has overseen thousands of job cuts and closed warehouses in an attempt to get a grip on costs. It is also closing many of its physical stores.\n\nThe company said it expected sales to grow by up to 10pc in the next quarter. Mr Jassy said Amazon was increasing delivery speeds. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to like about how our teams are delivering for customers, particularly amidst an uncertain economy,\u201d he said.\n\nAmazon\u2019s results came a day after Facebook owner Meta beat Wall Street forecasts.

Operating income was $4.8 billion. Analysts, on average, projected $3 billion.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest online retailer and cloud-computing provider has been working for more than a year to streamline its businesses to adjust to slowing sales growth in online shopping and its Amazon Web Services division. The company is cutting 27,000 jobs, the largest such cull in its history, with the latest round of layoffs announced Wednesday landing mostly on employees of AWS, its cloud unit.\n\nSales in the cloud unit rose 16% to $21.4 billion, more than Wall Street projected, although it was the fifth straight quarter that AWS year-over-year sales growth declined. Some analysts have speculated that a slowdown in corporate technology spending could push the cloud unit\u2019s growth rates to single digits later this year.\n\nAmazon\u2019s results suggested the company\u2019s efforts to reduce costs are starting to bear fruit. Operating expenses increased 8.7% in the quarter, the slowest pace in at least a decade. The company\u2019s North America segment was profitable on an operating basis for the first time since late 2021.\n\nThe Seattle-based company projected sales of $127 billion to $133 billion in the current period ending in June and operating profit of $2 billion to $5.5 billion. Both were in line with estimates.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon\u2019s positive results follow similar good news this week from fellow big tech companies Alphabet Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc. Microsoft, like Amazon, reported sustained sales for its public cloud business while Alphabet\u2019s Google Cloud produced a profit for the first time. Meta\u2019s digital advertising business rebounded, returning the company to sales growth after three straight quarters of declines. Amazon reported a 21% increase in its advertising sales to $9.51 billion.\n\nThe shares rose to a high of $123 in extended trading after closing at $109.82 in New York.

Analysts surveyed by FactSet had expected $124.6 billion.\n\nProfits came out to $3.2 billion, or 31 cents per share, higher than the $2.24 billion industry analysts had expected. It's also a strong improvement from the same period last year, when the e-commerce giant reported its first quarterly loss in years mainly driven by a loss in value of its investment in the electric vehicle company Rivian Automotive.\n\nAmazon's stock rose 9% in after-hours trading.\n\nThe report on Thursday rounds out a busy earnings week for major tech companies. On Wednesday, Facebook parent Meta beat profit and revenue expectations, leading to a bounce in its stocks in after-hours trading. Microsoft posted a spike in profits on Tuesday driven by a strong showing in its cloud segment Azure, which recently saw some slowdowns in growth. Google reported its cloud business grew by a strong 28%, leading to its first operating profit. But it grew at a slower pace compared to the same period last year.\n\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy wrote in his annual shareholder\u2019s letter released earlier this month that AWS, the leader in the cloud market, was facing short-term headwinds as companies are becoming more cautious in their spending amid more uncertainty in the economy. The company said Thursday the segment grew 16% during the first quarter, which beat analyst expectations but had a much slower showing than a 37% growth rate a year prior.\n\nCompany executives have also said shoppers have become more conscious about their spending and are trying to save costs when they can. On top of that, many shoppers have let go of their pandemic-fueled reliance on e-commerce, which led Amazon to report record revenue figures at the time.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon reported no growth in the first quarter in its online retail business. It grew by 3% excluding foreign exchange rates.\n\nAmazon too has been cutting its expenses amid sluggish online sales and concerns over whether the U.S. will dip into a recession.\n\nThe company began trimming its spending last year by canceling some of its warehouse expansion plans and reducing headcount in its facilities through attrition. It accelerated cost-saving measures over the past couple of quarters by cutting 27,000 corporate roles in different units, including devices, advertising, AWS and Twitch, the popular live streaming platform it acquired in 2014. It has also axed several businesses that weren\u2019t bringing in enough cash, such as its healthcare startup Amazon Care, subsidiary fabric.com and the video calling device Amazon Glow. On Wednesday, the company said it would shut down its health-focused Halo devices and related membership service on August 1.\n\nIn February, the retailer said it would shut down some of its Amazon Fresh and Go convivence stores and pause expansions as it attempts to find the right formula for its grocery business.

Amazon Sidewalk is a low-bandwidth, long-range community network that connects devices across long distances where Wi-Fi and Bluetooth signals often cannot reach. With Sidewalk coverage extending to 90% of the U.S. population, developers can now build and connect a new range of devices for the network. Launched a loyalty linking capability for Amazon One, Amazon\u2019s palm recognition service that lets customers enter, identify, and pay. Panera is the first restaurant chain to offer the new loyalty linking capability, allowing customers to easily enroll in and redeem rewards, and pay for their purchases with just their palm.\n\nEmpowering employees and delivery service partners\n\nIn addition to its focus on customers, Amazon strives to make every day better for its employees and delivery service partners. For example, in the first quarter, the company:\n\nAnnounced plans to spend $200 million on safety technologies across Amazon\u2019s U.S. transportation network in 2023. These innovations include front-collision warning, lane-departure warning, speed limiters, and 360-degree camera detection systems. They are part of Amazon\u2019s work to ensure that vehicles and delivery partners are safe on the road, and the innovations are better for the environment. Announced that Amazon improved recordable incident rates worldwide by 11% from 2021 to 2022 and by almost 24% from 2019 to 2022. The company shared the data in the second edition of its safety report, Delivered With Care, which details how Amazon is advancing safety across its operations through investments in capital improvements, safety technology, vehicle safety controls, and engineered ergonomic solutions to reduce risks for employees, partners, and communities. Reached 1 billion packages handled by Robin, a robotic system used across Amazon\u2019s operations network in the U.S., Canada, and Europe.

New managers enrolled in the program participate in group sessions, on-the-job training, and self-paced learning to help them gain skills and confidence to lead successful teams and foster connections between new leaders.\n\nSupporting communities and protecting the environment\n\nAmazon believes that success and scale bring broad responsibility to help the planet, future generations, and local communities in which the company has a significant presence. Amazon employees have passion for investing in these areas, and a sampling of the efforts from this past quarter are that Amazon:\n\nActivated the company\u2019s global logistics network to support communities impacted by earthquakes in T\u00fcrkiye and Syria. The company turned its fulfillment center in Istanbul into a Disaster Relief Hub and partnered with local organizations to ship hundreds of thousands of relief items to affected regions. Amazon also made cash donations to non-governmental organizations and set up donation campaigns across 16 Amazon online stores globally to make it easy for customers to support communities impacted by these earthquakes. Set a record in 2022 for the most renewable energy purchased by a single company in one year. Amazon\u2019s renewable energy portfolio now includes 164 wind and solar farms and 237 rooftop solar projects in 22 countries, totaling over 20 gigawatts\u2014an amount of energy that could power 5.3 million U.S. homes.

Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, and the various factors detailed below.\n\nSecond Quarter 2023 Guidance\n\nNet sales are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from foreign exchange rates. Operating income is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 2022. This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded.\n\nA conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company\u2019s financial and operating results.\n\nThese forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com\u2019s financial results is included in Amazon.com\u2019s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.\n\nOur investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us.

If you want to see more places in this selection, go to the 5 Best Places to Live in South Carolina for Retirees.\n\nDespite the possibility of a recession in the US in 2023, South Carolina's economy remains strong and is expected to weather any potential impacts relatively well. Concerns regarding a potential recession stem from the current climate of high inflation and increasing interest rates. Research economist at the University of South Carolina (USC) Joseph Von Nessen attributes the cause of high inflation to imbalanced supply and demand dynamics across the country, including in South Carolina.\u00a0 The influx of federal stimulus, amounting to $6 trillion, throughout 2020 and 2021 has resulted in a surge of consumer demand, contributing significantly to the current inflation levels. However, Von Nessen remains optimistic about South Carolina's economy and anticipates that it will continue to grow for the foreseeable future, barring any unexpected circumstances.\n\nThe state's recovery from the pandemic has also been robust, with strong employment gains across most industries and regions. In 2022, South Carolina experienced a historic $10 billion in economic investment, with a significant portion of that being driven by the automotive industry's shift towards electric vehicles. Investment in the industry has been spurred by major announcements, such as the expansion of the BMW Plant in Spartanburg, which includes a $1.7 billion battery assembly plant in Woodruff. Additionally, Envision AECS, a Japanese electric battery technology company, also announced its plans to invest $810 million in building a battery cell plant in Florence County, while Redwood Materials Inc. announced a record $3.5 billion investment in Berkeley County. The trend is expected to continue, with Richland County anticipating a $323 million investment in a manufacturing plant for electric battery components. In addition to the automobile companies, some of the other popular multinationals operating in South Carolina include McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Starbucks Corp (NASDAQ:SBUX).\n\nStory continues\n\nSouth Carolina's strong economy offers retirees easy access to a wide range of amenities and services, making it an attractive destination for retirement.

By the Fall of 2022, it appears pet adoption levels have returned to pre-pandemic era levels. That said, people may be too worried about near-term weakness in the pet market.

The firm is a leader in the animal labs and testing space.\n\nAs people treat their pets more like humans, they are willing to spend far more to try to keep their animals in top health. In prior years, people often put a pet down once it developed a serious illness. Now, folks are far more open to advanced medical procedures for their cats and dogs.\n\nIdexx has a great position for this, having a reputation for being a one-stop shop across the industry. It offers rapid tests for vet\u2019s offices, off-site testing, and in-hospital settings. Regardless of the exact nature of future growth in pet wellness spending, Idexx should be involved.\n\nIDXX has been a tremendous performer, with shares rising from $9 in 2003 to nearly $500 today.

It has food, treats, toys, medicines and other health items. It has an extensive catalog, carrying more than 100,000 different products and services.\n\nCHWY stock had a tremendous run during the early days of the pandemic. The stock soared from $30 to a peak of almost $120. It has crashed back to around $30 now as the tailwind around pet spending has slowed from peak 2021 levels. In addition, e-commerce stocks have sold off more generally amid changing macroeconomic conditions such as high inflation.\n\nAt this price, Chewy could be set for a rebound as the company is already profitable, which sets it apart from various other online retailers. Chewy has done a fine job of building a solid brand for itself that seems to be capable of thriving against mass market competitors such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\nBark (BARK) a BarkBox (BARK) logo is seen displayed on a smartphone.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nBark (NYSE:BARK) is a smaller company focused on the pet food and toys business.

Traditionally, investors have been drawn to recurring revenue subscription models which would seemingly make Bark a winning stock idea.\n\nYet, the business has struggled to reach profitability. Over the past 12 months, the company brought in $538 million of revenues but lost $84 million overall. That\u2019s not an ideal profit margin.\n\nHowever, Bark already has a large revenue base and the company is seeking to expand its business into related items, such as pet food.

Both Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) bucked worries about a cloud slowdown earlier this week, dialing up the pressure on AWS to deliver. Google Cloud hit a milestone, clocking profitability for the first time, and Microsoft, leaning on its AI prowess, talked Wall Street into forgiving that Azure's growth has been declining every quarter since at least Q3 2022.\n\nSo, AWS may or may not stack up on Thursday, but it's possible that AWS weakness is also already priced into Amazon, according to UBS analyst Lloyd Walmsley, who has the stock rated at a Buy with a price target of $125.

Amazon is an online company and is the largest retailer in the world.\n\n\"We remain constructive on AMZN shares over a 12-month view and think that line of sight to an eventual AWS stabilization is the focus among investors,\" he wrote on April 24. \"We do not expect to get that this [quarter]. But sentiment is so weak and we think investors expect continued weakness already.\"\n\nAdditionally, updates on retail margins and \"broader context\" on cost-cutting will be important topics on the company's earnings call, as will how the company is \"positioned for Generative AI for AWS or otherwise,\" Walmsley noted.\n\nAmazon has announced plans to lay off a total of 27,000 employees over the last few months. On Wednesday, the company reportedly fired off a round of layoffs hitting both HR and at AWS. Previously, the company conducted layoffs in highly-visible segments of the business such as Alexa and gaming.\n\nStory continues\n\nAllie Garfinkle is a Senior Tech Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Given the industry\u2019s continued growth, e-commerce stocks can make for good investments.\n\nHere are three e-commerce stocks with huge return potential for long-term investors.\n\nMELI MercadoLibre $1,235.63 AMZN Amazon $104.98 EBAY eBay $43.36\n\nMercadoLibre (MELI) MercadoLibre (MELI) homepage on a smartphone\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvestors looking for a stock that has a track record of out-performance should definitely checkout MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI), the e-commerce and online auction company that is based in Argentina.\n\nMELI stock is up 50% this year and has gained 265% over the last five years. That kind of growth is impressive and leaves most other e-commerce companies in the dust.\n\nThis huge multi-year rally has given MercadoLibre a sky high valuation, with its stock currently trading at a price-earnings (P/E) ratio of 130, which is expensive.\n\nInvestors who prize growth might pay up for MELI stock. The company continues to expand at breakneck speed and its profits are accelerating. In 2022, MercadoLibre\u2019s revenue grew 49% from a year earlier to $10.5 billion.\n\nIts full-year profit swelled nearly 500% to $482 million from only $83 million in 2021. MercadoLibre\u2019s online payments unit, Mercado Pago, is growing fastest for the company, with payment volumes rising 60% last year. That kind of growth may justify a premium price for this stock.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) A photo of Amazon's (AMZN) logo on the side of a building.\n\nSource: Ioan Panaite / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nA lot of Wall Street analysts continue to pound the table on U.S. e-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\nMizuho (NYSE:MFG) just became the latest in a string of banks to slap a \u201cbuy\u201d rating on AMZN stock, along with a price target of $135, suggesting a 33% gain from current levels.\n\nWhile most analysts acknowledge that the online retailer faces some near-term headwinds as it restructures its business coming out of the pandemic, they continue to forecast long-term gains for shareholders.\n\nMoving through this year, Amazon should benefit from the employee layoffs, warehouse closures, and other cost reduction measures it has undertaken.\n\nThe company should also get a tailwind from its on-demand cloud computing platform, Amazon Web Services, which continues to be the fastest growing segment of its business.\n\nWhile AMZN stock remains nearly 30% lower than where it was trading at a year ago, the share price has recovered 21% so far in 2023, with more gains likely in coming months.\n\neBay (EBAY) ebay app on a smartphone\n\nSource: BigTunaOnline / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother option for investors in the e-commerce space is eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY).\n\nThe company that facilitates consumer and business sales through its website has seen its stock recover over the past six months and is down about half (17%) of the decline seen in rival Amazon\u2019s stock over the past 12 months.\n\nSince bottoming last September, EBAY stock has risen 26%. Unlike most technology and e-commerce companies, eBay pays its shareholders a generous dividend that currently yields 2.27% or 25 cents a share per quarter.\n\nOther reasons to be bullish on eBay is that the company is specializing in live shopping events through its \u201ceBay Live\u201d platform, recently hosting a sports trading card event. The company is also focusing on exclusive products such as a new line of sneakers designed for women. And, eBay is increasingly promoting refurbished items that are for sale on its website as a means of helping the environment. These differentiators are helping to separate eBay from its competitors and could help drive future sales, say analysts.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nJoel Baglole has been a business journalist for 20 years.

While many investors embrace a buy-and-hold philosophy, others are looking to buy low when the prices are right and then take their profits when the stock price reaches a crest.\n\nSure, there are some stocks out there that are already at a peak. But there are also a few winning stocks that are not only on the rise but are showing the potential for continued growth.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe Portfolio Grader is a fine tool for this exercise. It\u2019s a free tool that grades every stock on an A through F scale based on a series of metrics, including recent performance, earnings history, analyst sentiment, momentum and other factors.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for winning stocks, the Portfolio Grader is among the first places on your stop. Here are seven to consider now.\n\nLI Li Auto $22.48 TRKA Troika Media Group $0.19 BABA Alibaba  $83.01 AI C3.ai  $17.66 BBAI BigBear.ai $2.93 APO Apollo Global Management $61.17 BE Bloom Energy $16.43\n\nLi Auto (LI) a lithium ion battery\n\nSource: Olivier Le Moal/ShutterStock.com\n\nYou don\u2019t have to look too far to find a Chinese electric vehicle startup hoping to duplicate what\u00a0Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has done in the U.S. But my favorite that trades on a U.S. stock market exchange has to be Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI).\n\nOther EV startups are struggling now that Beijing\u2019s EV subsidies ended last year, but not Li. The automaker delivered 20,823 vehicles in March, an 88.7% increase from February. And first-quarter deliveries of 52,584 was a 65.8% increase from a year ago.\n\nLi launched its L7 luxury electric SUV in February and plans to add two new models, the L7 Air and the L8 Air. Excitement about the new models should help Li\u2019s growth even as other EV companies struggle.\n\nStory continues\n\nLI stock is up 8% this year, with a \u201cB\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nTroika Media Group (TRKA) Team job.

TRKA stock\n\nSource: SFIO CRACHO / Shutterstock.com\n\nPenny stocks are historically volatile, which is the case with Troika Media Group (NASDAQ:TRKA), a New York company in the advertising, marketing and consulting business.\n\nThe company\u2019s stock started the year at 11 cents and by March spiked to 76 cents (a gain of 560%) on the backs of short-sellers looking for a squeeze.\n\nBut the bottom fell out, and now the stock\u2019s down again to just under 20 cents per share. That\u2019s still a gain of 68% so far this year, and now the stock\u2019s looking oversold.\n\nAfter acquiring Converge Direct last year, Troika had a 1,125% increase in revenue for the six months ending Dec. 31, 2022. The company also posted adjusted EBITDA of $4.95 million \u2013 a year after recording a $4.58 million EBITDA loss.\n\nTrue, this is not for the faint of heart. But Troika has the potential to build on its gains if it can continue to show improvement in its revenue.\n\nTRKA stock has a \u201cB\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nAlibaba (BABA) The Alibaba (BABA) logo featured outside of an office building with bushes in the background\n\nSource: zhu difeng / Shutterstock.com\n\nHere\u2019s one that I don\u2019t think is risky at all.\u00a0Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) is the massive Chinese e-commerce stock with a growing cloud business that many compare favorably to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\nBABA is the superior stock that is still deeply discounted. In 2020 shares were more than $300 \u2013 they dipped as low as $63 late last year before beginning a slow climb back. Shares are up 14% from those lows, even after a recent slide.\n\nAlibaba had roughly 900 e-commerce customers in its 2022 fiscal year, handling more than $1 trillion in transactions. It also has a 37% market share with the Alibaba Cloud, making it the most significant player in China.\n\nMorgan Stanley analyst Gary Yu recently speculated that\u00a0BABA stock could hit $200, more than doubling its current price because of its current plan to divide into six separate businesses. The plan should help BABA avoid unwelcome antitrust probes that hurt Alibaba in recent years.\n\nBABA stock is an outstanding pick, with a \u201cB\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nC3.ai (AI) Close-up of letters \"AI\" written on a computer chip, symbolizing artificial intelligence and AI stocks\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/YAKOBCHUK V\n\nI would never say you should buy a stock just because of the boom of interest in artificial intelligence. But it\u2019s undeniable that C3.ai (NYSE:AI) is riding that wave of interest, much to the delight of shareholders.\n\nC3.ai stock is up 58% so far this year. The company works with many private sector clients, as well as the U.S. Air Force and the Department of Defense, to build enterprise AI applications.\n\n\u201cAI will soon be a\u00a0$600 billion addressable software market,\u201d CEO Tim Siebel predicts. \u201cEveryone will be using enterprise AI applications, just like they use PCs, just like they use relational databases, just like we use [customer relationship management software].\u201d\n\nEarnings for the company\u2019s fiscal Q3 2023 were much better than expected. Revenues of $66.67 million topped analysts\u2019 estimates for $64.25 million. And the company reported losing 6 cents per share in earnings, which was much better than the 22-cent EPS loss that Wall Street expected.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT is a game-changing product, and rival companies are also developing other AI applications that will continue to give C3.ai some extra fuel. AI stock has a \u201cB\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nBigBear.ai (BBAI) Purple and blue graphic of brain over top of data center, smartphone, laptop and various other tech, symbolizing artificial intelligence and AI stocks\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Nadya C\n\nIf C3.ai interests you, consider buying BigBear.ai (NYSE:BBAI). This Maryland company is located strategically close to Washington, D.C., and possesses a $900 million contract to be a prime contractor for the Air Force.\n\nBigBear.ai uses an end-to-end data analytics platform, coupled with AI and machine learning, to provide strategic insights to its clients.\n\nThe stock spiked to over $6 per share in February but has since fallen back to about $2.40. Even so, that\u2019s still a gain of 259% so far this year.\n\nHowever, a word of caution. Currently, BBAI stock is a little depressed because the company proposed a public stock offering. It disclosed that investors intend to sell more than 113 million shares of BBAI stock. While the company won\u2019t receive any proceeds from that sale, it will have to cover the costs, expenses and fees related to that offering.\n\nBut none of that is enough to shake me off BBAI stock, and it shouldn\u2019t worry you, either. BBAI has a \u201cB\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nApollo Global Management (APO) Apollo Global Management logo on website. APO stock.\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock\n\nBased in New York,\u00a0Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) is one of the world\u2019s leading alternative asset managers. It invests in credit, real estate and private equity and manages many annuities following its $11 billion purchase of Athene early last year.\n\nApollo is also working on an\u00a0$8.1 billion deal to purchase Univar Solutions (NYSE:UNVR), a specialty chemical and ingredient distributor. And it\u2019s weighing a bid for THG, a U.K. software and online retail company.\n\nYes, a lot is happening with Apollo, but that\u2019s to be expected for a company that has nearly $550 billion in assets under management, but it\u2019s a profitable business for investors. Bloomberg recently reported that Apollo\u2019s ninth private equity fund has a 25% net internal rate of return. Apollo is raising capital to launch its 10th fund.\n\nAPO stock may be less lucrative than that, but good potential exists. It has a \u201cB\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader. Apollo stock is up 14% over the last year, including 5% last month.\n\nBloom Energy (BE) BE stock Bloom Energy logo on a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock\n\nCalifornia\u2019s Bloom Energy (NYSE:BE) builds, sells and installs solid oxide platforms used to generate electricity and hydrogen. The renewable energy company is at the forefront of efforts to help businesses shift from fossil fuels.\n\nBloom should also see some benefits from the Inflation Reduction Act signed into law earlier this year. The federal legislation includes $10 billion in new energy tax credits to help industries convert to renewable energy sources. Bloom CEO KR Sridhar\u00a0called the legislation \u201ca game changer for Bloom Energy.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s music to investors\u2019 ears, as Bloom recorded a loss in the fourth quarter of $47.17 million, or 23 cents per share. But revenue of $462.5 million was better than expectations for $398.7 million. And the company is forecasting 2023 revenues between $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion.\n\nBE stock is up 28% since reaching a low in May 2022, although the stock has been up and down in recent months. It currently has a \u201cB\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nOn the date of publication, Louis Navellier held BABA and APO.

Television series are set to premiere on JioCinema on the same day as the U.S.,\" the companies said.\n\nClement Schwebig, President for India, Southeast Asia and Korea for Warner Bros, said the agreement was part of its commitment to the South Asia market, as the company looks to further strengthen the scale of its regional business.\n\nOne source told Reuters that the partnership would be exclusive and see most of Warner's marquee content on the JioCinema platform. Warner cannot offer most of its popular titles to other Indian rivals including Amazon Prime Video and Disney Hotstar, the source added.\n\n\"It's a deep exclusive arrangement which will make JioCinema the house of Warner, HBO in India,\" the source said.\n\nThe content deal will bring thousands of hours of streaming content onto JioCinema, which has become popular for showing the IPL cricket tournament on the platform for free in the ongoing season.\n\nStory continues\n\nViacom18 won the IPL digital streaming rights from 2023 to 2027 for around $2.9 billion, rights which Disney previously held. Viacom18's shareholders include Reliance, Paramount Global as well as Bodhi Tree, which is a joint venture between James Murdoch and a former Star India executive, Uday Shankar.\n\nBodhi Tree recently invested $528 million in Viacom18.\n\nSeveral of HBO's top rated shows, including Succession, had aired in India on the Disney Hotstar platform until March 31 as part of a deal between the two companies that ended on the date.\n\nThe source told Reuters that Warner so far had various arrangements with Indian streaming giants, but the Viacom-Warner deal will see consolidation of that library and will include HBO, Max and Warner content, among others.\n\nJioCinema is seeking to compete with rivals including Netflix and Amazon in a market where such platforms are becoming increasingly popular, thanks to cheap data prices.\n\n\"These marquee deals from IPL to HBO are great for not only user acquisition but also for stickiness and mind share,\" said Neil Shah, research director at Counterpoint Research.\n\nFor now, JioCinema is a small player. Netflix outperforms rivals in the subscription video-on-demand market, commanding a 39% share by revenue in 2021 compared to nearest rival Hotstar's 23%, according to Media Partners Asia.

Elsewhere, House Republicans pass a new debt ceiling bill, but the political wrangling in Washington over the issue looks to be far from finished.\n\n1. Growth data on the horizon\n\nU.S. stocks are seen opening higher on Thursday, as investors await the release of key economic data and gauge renewed concerns over the health of the country's banking sector.\n\nBy 05:15 ET (09:15 GMT), the Dow futures contract was up 78 points or 0.23%, S&P 500 futures traded 20 points or 0.49% higher, and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 105 points or 0.81%.\n\nGrowth in the U.S. is projected to have slowed to 2.0% annually in the first quarter, according to Reuters projections, down from 2.6% in the prior three-month period. Economists anticipate that relative weakness in inventories and exports will be countered by an uptick in consumption in the world's biggest economy.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's recent aggressive string of interest rate hikes is also expected to show signs of weighing on broader activity. Over the past year, the U.S. central bank has lifted borrowing costs at an unprecedented clip in an attempt to cool red-hot inflation.\n\nNext week, the Fed is widely tipped to increase rates by another 25 basis points, which would bring the federal funds target to a range of 5% to 5.25%. However, officials may be mulling over a pause in the tightening cycle to give themselves time to examine the impact of last month's turmoil in the financial services sector.\n\nA sharp dip in shares of regional lender First Republic has stoked fresh worries that the banking tumult may only be in remission, and not yet completely eradicated. First Republic Bank (NYSE:FRC), which reported $100 billion in customer withdrawals in March, saw its stock tumble by 29.75% on Wednesday, extending a series of sharp declines throughout this week.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Meta Reels in ad sales\n\nGrowth in advertising sales has returned to Facebook parent Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) for the first time in almost a year, which chief executive Mark Zuckerberg credited to solid performance of Reels, the tech giant's answer to the craze for TikTok-like short-form videos.\n\nAd revenue moved higher by 4.1% in the January to March period to $28.10B, topping Bloomberg consensus estimates of $26.76B. The total top-line figure in Meta's second quarter increased by 2.6% year-on-year to $28.65B, also beating expectations.\n\nIn a call with analysts, Zuckerberg said Reels was helping drive overall app engagement, adding that the company believes it is gaining share in the short-form video market.\n\nShares in Meta, which also delivered a higher-than-anticipated second quarter revenue forecast of $29.5B to $32B, gained more than 11% in after-hours trading on Wednesday.\n\nThe initial signs of recovery in advertising at Meta may help assuage some investor concerns over the heavy spending the firm has doled out on developing Zuckerberg's metaverse project. The slowdown in advertising and the big bet on artificial intelligence has proved costly for Meta, leading it to heavily slash expenses, particularly through tens of thousands of layoffs.\n\nZuckerberg has previously defended the belt-tightening as a necessary part of what he has called a \"year of efficiency.\" But his message to analysts was noticeably more upbeat on Wednesday.\n\n\"When we started this work last year, our business wasn't performing as well as I wanted. But now we're increasingly doing this work from a position of strength,\" Zuckerberg said.\n\n3. Tech earnings parade marches on\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) will report its first quarter results after the close of U.S. trading on Thursday, rounding out a week of earnings from some of the biggest names in the U.S. technology industry.\n\nInvestors will be particularly keen to see just how deep a recent downturn in sales growth has been at the e-commerce behemoth's key cloud-computing division.\n\nAmazon Web Services, or AWS, has in the past accounted for the lion's share of the group's total operating profit. But the unit has seen its revenue growth slump to 27% earlier this year, the lowest level since Amazon began separating cloud results from the broader company, as potential customers rein in technology spending amid worries over an impending economic downturn.\n\nOn Wednesday, Amazon also unveiled layoffs at both AWS and its human resources division as part of a sweeping round of job cuts that are estimated to impact 9,000 workers. Analysts expect the reduced expenses will help improve margins in the second half of 2023.\n\nAlong with Meta, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) have also posted their latest earnings this week, with both sets of returns pointing to continued resilience in cloud spending and advertising sales.\n\n4. U.S. House passes debt ceiling bill\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives approved a bill on Wednesday that would raise the country's debt ceiling by $1.5 trillion as the threat of an upcoming default looms.\n\nIn a narrow 217-215 vote that had zero Democratic support, the Republican-controlled lower chamber of the U.S. Congress passed a measure that featured cuts to government spending plans backed by the Biden administration, including a proposed cancellation of some student loan debt.\n\nLawmakers now face a deadline, estimated to be sometime in June, for the federal government to avoid default. But the politics around the debt ceiling remain deeply complex, with Biden and Democratic leaders in Congress already accusing Republicans of using the issue to gain concessions on key policy areas.\n\nKevin McCarthy, the Republican House Speaker credited with shepherding through the passage of the bill, has said that Biden \"should sit down and negotiate.\" For his part, Biden has said he is happy to meet with McCarthy, but not over whether the debt limit gets extended.\n\nHowever the matter shakes out, fears are growing that the U.S. government may not be able to meet its debt obligations should the talks over $31.4T borrowing limit fail. Many investors are racing to snap up short-term government debt that matures before the ominous so-called \"X-date\" when extraordinary measures put in place by the Treasury Department earlier this year to prevent a default expire. Debt that matures in midsummer, meanwhile, is being avoided, causing massive distortions in the short-term T-bill market.\r\n\r\n5. U.S. crude inventories fall, but oil demand concerns persist\n\nOil prices edged higher on Thursday due in part to a drop in weekly U.S. crude inventories that was far bigger than anticipated.\n\nU.S. crude stocks decreased by about 5.1 million barrels last week, following a 4.6M-barrel drawdown in the prior week, according to data from the Energy Information Administration released late Wednesday. The reading was expected to show a 1.5M-barrel decrease.\n\nBy 05:17 ET, U.S. crude futures were 0.19% higher at $74.44 a barrel, while the Brent contract climbed 0.30% to $77.95 per barrel.\n\nBut both benchmarks are on course to post losses of almost 4% this week, close to a one-month low, as concerns remain over how a possible slowdown in economic growth will hit future oil demand. Oil prices have largely erased gains made on the back of a surprise production cut by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies at the start of this month.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nMeta earnings, U.S. growth data, debt ceiling bill passed - what's moving markets\n\nEurope battles to shake off nagging banking concerns\n\nTravel demand fuels American Airlines revenue rise, guidance tops expectations", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-earnings-u-growth-data-060156523.html", "symbols": ["ABEA.F", "ABEA.XETRA", "ABEC.F", "ABEC.XETRA", "AMZ.F", "AMZ.XETRA", "AMZN.MX", "AMZN.US", "AMZO34.SA", "FRC.US", "GOGL34.SA", "GOGL35.SA", "GOOG.MX", "GOOG.US", "GOOGL.US", "META.US", "MSFT.US"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": -0.305, "neg": 0.102, "neu": 0.796, "pos": 0.102}}, {"date": "2023-04-27T01:38:15+00:00", "title": "Analysts Agree: 3 Stocks That Are Epic Must-Buys", "content": "It\u2019s been a weird year.

If that comes to fruition, it leaves shares trading at roughly 20.5 times this year\u2019s earnings and 17.1 times next year\u2019s earnings.

That said, I am surprised at just how badly it has lagged in the recent rally. Admittedly, investors are confused about this name. Is it a growth stock or a value stock? Where does it fit within the tech space?\n\nI mentioned above that a handful of mega-cap tech names have led the upside rally. PayPal is clearly not one of them. Shares are up just 8.5% from their 2022 low despite suffering a decline of more than 78% from their high. It seems investors want nothing to do with PayPal stock right now.\n\nThat\u2019s despite management turning in some pretty decent earnings reports and amid solid upside estimates. Analysts expect more than 18% earnings growth this year and roughly 15% growth next year. Yet, shares trade at just 15 times forward earnings.\n\nThere are 31 analyst recommendations on the stock and the consensus target suggests 62.5% upside potential.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nEnding this list of analyst-recommended stocks to buy now, we have another mega-cap tech stock: Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which has a market capitalization of $1.08 trillion. Whether it stays in the trillion-dollar club likely depends on how the market reacts to its earnings report, which is scheduled to be released after tomorrow\u2019s close.\n\nWhile you may want to wait to see what the stock does after earnings, analysts are quite bullish on the online retail giant. With 39 recommendations, the consensus price target points to roughly 37% upside potential.\n\nDue to its conglomerate nature, Amazon has become a bit of a tough one for investors to analyze. On the one hand, Amazon Web Services continues to drive strong financial results. On the other hand, there are worries about growth, as its retail unit is susceptible to rising logistic costs and a slowdown in consumer spending.\n\nThat said, Amazon has built an incredible business that is clearly on the mend after a tough 2022.\n\nOn the date of publication, Bret Kenwell held a long position in PYPL.

A recession is on the cards later this year, and if you are only worried about protecting what you have while having returns that can beat inflation, I would not recommend investing in many of the hotter growth stocks this year.\n\nNow don\u2019t get me wrong \u2014 growth names are an essential part of your portfolio and they can substantially amplify your returns over a long period of time. But for retirees and people looking to preserve their existing capital, the volatility that comes with growth stocks may not be worth it.\n\nWith that in mind, let\u2019s look at stocks that have returned at least 6% or more annually. The core consumer price index currently sits at 5.6% in the U.S., and it has been sticky for the past few months.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe following seven can comfortably beat that and some more with little downside risk:\n\nFlowers Foods, Inc. (FLO) A hand holds a bag of Dave's Killer Bread at the grocery store\n\nSource: TonelsonProductions / Shutterstock.com\n\nFlowers Foods, Inc. (NYSE:FLO) is a bakery company operating 47 bakeries. FLO is among the most recession-proof stocks on the market as it has consistently delivered a modest upside with its 3.24% dividend yield which allows it to beat losses from inflation easily.\n\nFurthermore, FLO stock outperforms the broader market during downturns. From December 2021 to October 2022, the S&P500 shed nearly a quarter of its value. Flowers Foods stock lost around 4% of its value during the same period.\n\nSales have also started to pick back up in recent quarters. It ended 2022 with double-digit growth in sales, and analysts expect it to grow 7.9% this year. I believe 10% is in the cards.\n\nThere\u2019s not much else to talk about this stable and consistent business except that it won\u2019t disappoint you as long as you hold it. If you\u2019re a retiree or looking for capital preservation, FLO is one of the top low-risk stocks you can get into.\n\nStory continues\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) McDonald's restaurant in Thailand.\n\nSource: Tama2u / Shutterstock\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) is a business that thrives during turmoil, and not only is that historically proven, but recent trends have also suggested that the business is booming. Its Q1 earnings report surprised analysts with an impressive 12.6% margin on sales.\n\nThe company has immense pricing power as there\u2019s no slowdown in demand, despite the price hikes. Sales increased by nearly 13%, which is remarkable for a restaurant business in this environment. But McDonald\u2019s business model allows it to pull off these figures as it attracts customers from all economic spectrums during periods of economic downturn and high inflation.\n\nNaturally, the stock is gaining momentum right now, as many see it as a safe haven. And I don\u2019t blame them. McDonald\u2019s has been a consistent performer for decades, delivering dividends and growth to its shareholders. It\u2019s also constantly innovating and adapting to changing consumer preferences and tastes. Whether it\u2019s plant-based burgers, digital ordering, or delivery services, McDonald\u2019s seems ahead of the curve.\n\nSo if you\u2019re looking for a stock that can satisfy your appetite for profits and comfort food, look no further than McDonald\u2019s. It\u2019s a no-brainer in my book, especially since analysts expect sales growth to continue the healthy trajectory, with a 6.6% forecast for 2024.\n\nPepsiCo (PEP) Pepsi (PEP) Factory in Samara, Russia. Pepsi logo on a blue warehouse.\n\nSource: FotograFFF / Shutterstock\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for one of the safest bets you can make in the market right now, look no further than PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) stock. This is a company that has proven its stability and consistency over the years and is unlikely to disappoint investors anytime soon.\n\nWhy do I say that? For starters, PepsiCo is a dividend king, with 51 consecutive years of dividend increases, a sweetener that adds up over time, along with consistent stock returns. Plus, you can count on PepsiCo to keep raising its payout every year, regardless of the economic conditions (as the company\u2019s cash position is among the strongest), with $5.35 billion in cash and an operating cash flow of $12.8 billion.\n\nPepsiCo has also shown its resilience during times of turmoil. For example, during the pandemic, the company only had one quarter of sales decline in 2020, while many other businesses struggled.\n\nFurthermore, speaking of economic conditions, PepsiCo is also a recession-proof stock. The company\u2019s portfolio of products is well-established, and consumers worldwide are unlikely to stop purchasing them regardless of ripples in the economy.\n\nAll things considered, PEP is worth every penny and then some and deserves a spot in every retirement portfolio. You won\u2019t regret holding it for the long run.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) The logo for Berkshire Hathaway displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, BRK-B) is a must-buy stock for a retirement portfolio. Warren Buffett is arguably the best person you can follow if you\u2019re a beginner in the stock market trying to craft a portfolio for long-term gains with little downside risk. The best way to do so is by buying stock in Berkshire Hathaway, which continues to be among the most consistent in the market.\n\nArguably, the best reason to buy Berkshire Hathaway stock is the man himself. Warren Buffett has proven time and time again that he can navigate the waters during a recession, finding bargains and opportunities that others miss. He has also shown a willingness to adapt to changing times, investing in companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). You can certainly trust Buffett to make the decisions for you during harsh times.\n\nEven if Buffett passes away, I believe the successors won\u2019t disappoint with the tools they\u2019d be left with. The company has a boatload of cash at $128.6 billion and a portfolio to boot.\n\nAstraZeneca (AZN)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) might\u2019ve slipped out of the purview since last year, as most people only know it for its coronavirus vaccine. However, the company does much more than that. AstraZeneca has a deep pipeline with multiple therapies in development for cancer, cardiovascular, kidney, and respiratory diseases, making it one of the top biopharmaceutical companies in the world.\n\nAstraZeneca\u2019s stock performance has also been wonderful if you compare it to other vaccine-developing companies. It has continued on a consistent and stable trajectory for the last decade, returning 15.4% per year if you reinvest all the dividends. That easily beats inflation.\n\nConversely, we are seeing a temporary sales decline due to the slowdown of Covid-19 related sales. AstraZeneca\u2019s Q4 revenue declined by 7%, which is making some investors choose Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) over AZN due to its higher dividend yield and lower valuation. Still, AZN\u2019s long-term prospects make it a clear buy, as some of the drugs in the pipeline can make it a winner.\n\nThe average price target presents a 61.9% upside here.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nVisa (NYSE:V) is Mastercard\u2019s (NYSE:MA) bigger counterpart, and I believe both are a buy, but I\u2019d bet my cards on Visa if you\u2019re looking for more stability (especially after the Q2 report). V stock has so far outperformed MA, offering a higher yield and even a lower price-to-earnings ratio. The company is widely regarded as a recession-resilient business, and it also profits from the higher interest rates.\n\nThe company\u2019s remarkable margins (a 50%-plus net margin) will allow it to weather the harshest of recessions and cushion investors from a stock market decline. Thus, I believe any dips will be temporary due to the strength of V\u2019s underlying business. It has also consistently outperformed the market.\n\nVisa reported its Q2 earnings yesterday, exceeding expectations with profits of $4.26 billion, putting earnings per share at $2.09 versus Zacks\u2019 estimate of $1.97. Sales also came in at $7.99 billion, surpassing analyst expectations of $7.75 billion. Thus, I believe its average price target with a 16% upside will likely be upgraded over the coming days.\n\nMondelez International (MDLZ) The Mondelez website magnified by a magnifying glass\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nMondelez International (NASDAQ:MDLZ) manufactures chocolate, cookies, biscuits, gum, confectionery, and powdered beverages. From a business standpoint, it\u2019s a solid investment for the long haul. If you held it for the last decade and reinvested the modest dividends, the annual return here would be near 11%. That\u2019s very compelling!\n\nI would still note that the company\u2019s high sales growth could slow down in 2024. Analysts expect its 3-year average sales growth of 8.6% to slow down to 3.7% next year. That might cause a slowdown or a decline in the near term, which is why I\u2019m putting MDLZ at the caboose of this low-risk stocks article.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The precarious nature of the current market regime makes this report quite significant.\n\nOf particular interest to investors will be revenue numbers in AWS Cloud, as it has been a major driver of growth for Amazon. Its primary competitors in the cloud space, Microsoft MSFT, and Alphabet GOOGL reported earnings Tuesday evening, and provided interesting insights into what to expect from AMZN.\n\nAmazon has been on a tear, rallying 25% YTD, considerably better performance than the S&P 500. However, investors shouldn\u2019t forget how painful 2022 was for AMZN. The stock price more than halved in 2022, leaving Amazon shares still down almost -40% over the last two years, well below the performance of the index. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTechnical Setup\n\nAmazon stock traded down to an area of strong buying interest over the last few months. After testing, and then trading below the pre-covid highs, AMZN stock price dove all the way down to the Covid-lows. But after testing the Covid-lows, buyers stepped in massively, pushing price back to the top of the range.\n\nIf Amazon can retake the pre-Covid highs ~$110 level, it should be an extremely bullish signal for the stock. Additionally, the $100 level seems to be a psychological level of interest, and I think so long ass price holds above there, investors can remain bullish. TradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nEarnings Expectations\n\nConsidering the forecasted weakness in business and consumer spending broadly, analysts still have fairly strong expectations for Amazon. Sales are projected to grow 7.2% YoY to $125 billion for the current quarter. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBut analyst estimates have been falling over the last two months. Earnings for the current quarter have been revised lower by -12.5%, and because of the amount of downgrades Amazon currently exhibits a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), indicating mixed earnings revisions.\n\nStory continues\n\nNonetheless, the Zacks Earnings ESP expects Amazon to beat estimates by 11.5%. Last quarter Amazon really blew away analyst expectations and reported earnings that were 40% above estimates. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nCloud Computing\n\nIn the Q4 report, Amazon\u2019s cloud computing segment reported 20% growth YoY, below Q3\u2019s 28% growth, and Q2 33% growth. While 20% growth in sales is nothing to scoff at, the deceleration is an extremely important development, as AWS is a major engine for growth. Because of the shifting macroeconomic environment, firms have clearly tried to cut some of their cloud spending.\n\nMicrosoft reported better than expected earnings on Tuesday, beating both sales and earnings expectations. But Microsoft posted a considerable deceleration in its cloud services sales as well. Cloud services reported a 27% YoY growth in sales which has declined every quarter since at least Q3 2022. Additionally, while MSFT did beat estimates, they were very moderate expectations, barely projecting growth.\n\nAlphabet too had very soft earnings expectations which they beat handily. GOOGL also followed the same trend as MSFT regarding slowing growth. Google cloud services grew 28% YoY, which again is a very impressive number, but still a quarter over quarter decline. Additionally, Alphabet reported its first profitable quarter in cloud services, which is a strong development.\n\nThese slowdowns are certainly not ringing any alarm bells \u2013 yet. Cloud is a maturing business, and at some point, growth was going to slow down. But investors should stay focused on Amazon\u2019s cloud services growth numbers. AWS is the leading provider of cloud services so an unexpected slowdown may shake things up.\n\nValuation\n\nAmazon is currently trading at a one-year forward price to sales ratio of 1.9x, which is well below its 10-year median of 2.7x and below the broad market average of 3.6x. This is a compelling valuation for the tech giant. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nIt is critical for investors to watch for the cloud services growth numbers from Amazon on Thursday\u2019s earnings call. As the biggest player in the industry, owning 34% market share (MSFT is 2nd with 21%), its results are a bellwether for the sector more broadly.\n\nAlso important will be the e-commerce and retail results. Because Amazon is such a massive player in the retail industry its business results provide valuable insight into the spending habits of consumers.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Arya noted that the adoption of AI applications is still in an early stage and 2023 \"is probably the first year of what could be a 5 or 10 year investment cycle\". Arya noted that managing AI workloads requires high levels of computational power and resources.\u00a0He talked about how NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is now competing with cloud services providers such as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet Inc.

On April 18, Reuters reported that Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has been working on its AI chip since 2019 and it is now in a testing phase.\n\nVivek Arya talked about chip pricing and how the increasing adoption of AI by cloud services providers is calling for more high performance semiconductors. He said that though NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) new chips are up to 3 times more expensive than the company's previous generation products, they are also offering higher performance and increased energy efficiency.

And now what we have in the valley is\u00a0three or four hundred startup companies\u00a0that are trying to develop new and innovative applications with this new\u00a0technology. So when they do that they need compute power that is\u00a0available on the cloud and that is where\u00a0the need for GPUs, we think, can grow even\u00a0faster than what we had anticipated last year.\"\n\nAs AI adoption increases, the need for more sophisticated and powerful semiconductors is expected to grow.

Unlike competitors Alibaba (BABA) and JD.com (JD), Pinduoduo offers a unique team buying value proposition. This enables a consumer to partner up with friends and neighbors in order to benefit from bulk buying discounts of products. This is an incredibly innovative business model and has been one of the keys to Pinduoduo's success in China.\n\nPDD 15-Year Financial Data The intrinsic value of PDD Peter Lynch Chart of PDD\n\nNow, the company has started to execute on its bold international expansion plans through the launch of its Temu app in the U.S. This article will take a look at the incredible tailwinds behind Temu and how it demonstrates the unique competitive advantages Pinduoduo has built for itself; lets dive in. Pinduoduo: Explosive Growth as Temu Disrupts E-Commmerce\n\nPDD Data by NASDAQ:AMZN), such as a pebble bath mat, lamps, etc., and found Temu to be around one third cheaper. This is where the tagline shop like a billionaire comes in, as its products are so cheap consumers effectively get a class upgrade.\n\nI also found the website user interface to be fairly international in its style, but it was extremely engaging. The products sold look to include many niche products which you didnt relize you need until you see them. For example, it even offers things like self heating socks, an avocado slicer and a soap box drainer that can be hard to find in stores.\n\nTherefore, I expect Temu to generate huge sales from niche goods at scale, which will of course benefit Pinduoduo. The app also has the potential to disrupt Amazon due to its cheaper prices, although since Pinduoduo doesnt have the vast U.S. logistics infrastructure like Amazon, its delivery times are likely to be less favorable.\n\nGrowing financials\n\nPinduoduo reported growing financial results for the fourth quarter of 2022. The business generated revenue of $5.7 billion, which rose by a solid 37% per year, which rose to a 46% growth rate in the local currency. \r\n\r\nI believe this growth rate was partially driven by the Temu app, but the full-quarter effects will show up in the first quarter 2023 results.\n\nStory continues Pinduoduo: Explosive Growth as Temu Disrupts E-Commmerce\n\nPDD Data by Pinduoduo: Explosive Growth as Temu Disrupts E-Commmerce\n\nPDD Data by GuruFocus\n\nPinduoduo's selling, general and administrative expenses also rose by nearly 300% to $237.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. This may seem terrible at first glance, but in the earnings call, management stated this was due to hiring in its core business and Temu segment. This is fine with me as it shows the company is still in growth mode - it must hire to meet demand. Research and development expenses also increased to $349 million, up 19% year over year. Given these R&D expenses only contribute to ~10% of total expenses, I deem these to be fairly reasonable.\n\nPinduoduo has a fortress balance sheet with $21.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities compared to total debt of approximately $2.4 billion.\n\nValuationIn order to value Pinduoduo, I have plugged its latest financial data into my discounted cash flow valuation model. Over the next four quarters, I have estimated 27% revenue growth, which I feel is fairly conservative given the company grew its revenue ~37% in the fourth quarter of 2022. \r\n\r\nIn years two through five, I have forecast an even faster growth rate of 28% per year, as the Chinese economy continues to roar and international e-commerce rebounds (benefiting Temu). Pinduoduo: Explosive Growth as Temu Disrupts E-Commmerce\n\nI have been fairly conservative with margin estimates, predicting just a 1.52% increase over the next eight years. This is because I expect the business to reinvest for growth, and e-commerce can be tough business in relation to margins, as I have discovered in my analysis of Amazon. One margin booster for Pinduoduo has been its R&D investments, which I have captialized. Pinduoduo: Explosive Growth as Temu Disrupts E-Commmerce\n\nGiven the financials and my forecasts, I get an intrinsic value estimate of $227 per share. The stock is trading at around $65 per share at the time of writing and thus it is ~71.35% undervalued.\n\nThe GF Value chart indicates a fair value of $132.82 per share, rating the stock significantly undervalued. Pinduoduo: Explosive Growth as Temu Disrupts E-Commmerce\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nPinduoduo is a tremendous e-commerce company and an incredibly creative business. I believe its team buying strategy is innovative and am honestly surprised to have not seen something similar in the West. The Temu app has taken the U.S. by storm and could potentially disrupt major players such as Amazon. This will definitely be one to watch as the e-commerce industry continues to grow.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pinduoduo-explosive-growth-temu-disrupts-171829292.html", "symbols": ["9PDA.F", "AMZ.F", "AMZ.XETRA", "AMZN.MX", "AMZN.US", "AMZO34.SA", "PDD.US"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.999, "neg": 0.014, "neu": 0.818, "pos": 0.168}}, {"date": "2023-04-26T16:45:04+00:00", "title": "Microsoft's (MSFT) Q3 Earnings, Revenues Beat on Cloud Strength", "content": "Microsoft MSFT reported third-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings of $2.45 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 10.4% and improved 10.4% on a year-over-year basis.\r\n\r\nRevenues of $52.8 billion increased 7.1% year over year and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.78%.

For more internet stocks, head on over to 5 Cheap Internet Stocks to Buy Now.\n\nThe world that we live in today is vastly different from the one just a couple of decades ago. Want a ride? Use your smartphone. Want to order food? Again, you're smartphone is right there. Bored and want to watch Netflix? Guess what gadget will help you once again. However, the smartphone would not have half the functionality that it has today were it not for the Internet. The project, initially started by the U.S. military, is now a global reality and its impacts are so profound that even the United Nations has adopted a non binding resolution that believes internet access is a human right. This definition builds on the human right to free speech and access to resolution, but the resolution was opposed by some countries such as Russia, Saudi Arabia, India, and China.\n\nAt the same time, the Internet has also given us multi billion dollar companies that rely on it as a primary component of their business model. The biggest example of this is the rise of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), which is one of the world's biggest electronic commerce retailers and whose latest market capitalization sits at a stunning $996 billion. Another mega company that owes its existence to everybody's favorite communications and entertainment medium, is Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). Finally, any mention of Internet companies is incomplete without Google, whose parent company Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is the largest on our brief set of examples through an absolutely massive market capitalization of $1.2 trillion.\n\nBut how big, or what really is the 'internet industry'? This is a tough question that is bound to leave you scratching your head, because after all, if it weren't for the Internet, Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) wouldn't exist either. So does this primary reliance on the Internet make Uber an internet company? Or is it simply a transportation services provider, and telecommunications firms such as Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) which actually do provide everyday users with Internet coverage are the true internet companies? We think it's both of them, and it's an important distinction to make as you'll find you below.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe distinction is important because it lets us place a value on the true worth of firms in this elusive internet industry since it has several sub segments with massive valuations of their own. For instance, consider the video on demand industry that's dominated by Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX). According to a research report from Fortune Business Insights, this industry was worth $69.5 billion in 2021 and is expected to grow through a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.6% until 2029 to sit at an estimated $257 billion by the end of the forecast period. Another estimate, this time for the transportation as a service (TaaS) industry which consists primarily of firms like Uber, suggests that this sector presents an unbelievable market opportunity of $8 trillion courtesy of its different constituent divisions such as micro mobility. Yet, while the TaaS sector presents an $8 trillion opportunity, the global electronic commerce industry has already crossed the lucrative trillion dollar valuation, with one research report outlining that this industry was worth $2.6 trillion in 2021, will have grown to $3 trillion in 2022, and from then until 2026 will demonstrate a CAGR of 12% for a final value of $4.79 trillion.\n\nFinally, even though it has shaken up human existence, the Internet still has more in store for us. This is courtesy of both 5G telecommunications (for 5G stocks, take a look at 13 Best 5G Stocks to Buy) and satellite coverage (for more on space, head on over to 11 Best Space Stocks to Invest In) - both of which have started to pick up the pace only recently and are projected to have a massive valuation. For instance, the global satellite internet market is estimated to grow at a stunning 20.4% CAGR between 2021 and 2030 and have a final value of $18.5 billion according to Allied Market Research, and according to estimates from the investment bank Morgan Stanley, the sector will represent at least 50% of the total growth in the global space economy by 2040. For reference, the bank believes that the space sector can cross $1 trillion by that time.\n\nAs for 5G, here's what Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ)'s chief executive officer Mr. Hans Vestberg had to say during the firm's latest analyst call:\n\nOur engineers have the best track record for designing and building networks that produce the best experience. Our network will continue to evolve with a relentless commitment to quality and reliability, adding capacity where needed and filling service gaps where they exist even as capital intensity declines in the coming years. In the shift to 5G, we have been rapidly building out our C-band spectrum with the most aggressive deployment plan in our company\u2019s history. We are tracking to 200 million POPs this quarter and are well ahead of schedule to reach our 250 million POP targeted by year-end 2024. C-band propagation is very similar to that of AWS and PCS spectrum, which covers more than 300 million POPs today. This gives us a clear path to scale C-band quickly and efficiently, including in the 330 markets where we expect to gain complete access to the C-band spectrum later this year.\n\nWith these details in mind, it's time to take a look at some cheap internet stocks, with the top picks being VEON Ltd.

AWS generates most of the company\u2019s profits but is experiencing slowing growth as corporate customers look to trim expenses.\n\nOverall, Amazon is axing 27,000 mostly corporate positions after a hiring spree during the pandemic left the company with too many people. Having wrapped up a round of job cuts earlier this year that totaled about 18,000 workers, Amazon announced another 9,000 layoffs in March, which Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy said would land on AWS, human resources, advertising and the Twitch livestreaming service. Cuts were rolled out in recent weeks in areas including Twitch and the company\u2019s video game group.\n\n\u201cIt is a tough day across our organization\u201d AWS chief Adam Selipsky said in the email reviewed by Bloomberg.\n\nAWS, like much of the rest of Amazon, expanded its headcount rapidly as the pandemic boosted demand for digital services.\n\n\u201cGiven this rapid growth, as well as the overall business and macroeconomic climate, it is critical that we focus on identifying and putting our resources behind our top priorities\u2014those things that matter most to customers and that will move the needle for our business,\u201d Selipsky said. \u201cIn many cases this means team members are shifting the projects, initiatives or teams on which they work; however, in other cases it has resulted in these role eliminations.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nSelipsky added that cuts in regions outside North America would roll out following local processes, including consultations with employee groups where mandated by law.\n\nSome AWS-related teams had already been hit by layoffs, including recruiters and members of the \u201cJust Walk Out\u201d physical stores technology group that joined the division in a reorganization last year. But the first rounds of cuts landed heaviest on the company\u2019s recruiting and human resources teams, its sprawling retail group and devices teams.\n\nWednesday brought more cuts to Amazon\u2019s beleaguered HR group, which has been subject to waves of buyout offers and cuts that began in November.\n\nBeth Galetti, who leads the People Experience and Technology team, as Amazon calls HR, announced the latest set of cuts in an email Wednesday. \u201cThese decisions are not taken lightly, and I recognize the impact it will have across both those transitioning out of the company as well as our colleagues who remain,\u201d she said.\n\nAn Amazon spokesperson declined to comment on the latest layoffs, referring back to Jassy\u2019s email in March saying that they would be coming.\n\nAmazon has instituted a hiring freeze for jobs outside its warehouses and delivery operations \u2014 with exceptions for certain projects and jobs \u2014 and managers say it\u2019s not clear when the company might begin hiring en masse again.\n\nAmazon employed 1.54 million people worldwide at the end of December. The vast majority of those workers are hourly employees who pack and ship products in warehouses. Before the first round of layoffs began in November, the company said it had roughly 350,000 corporate employees.\n\nOther tech giants have also reduced their headcount, including Meta Platforms Inc., Google parent company Alphabet Inc., Microsoft Corp., Dell Technologies Inc. and International Business Machines Corp.\n\nAmazon is scheduled to report financial results on Thursday, and investors will be watching to see if cost-cutting measures have helped profitability and whether cloud services sales growth is bottoming out.\n\n(Updates with details on human resources cuts, spokesperson declining to comment, beginning in the ninth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nMusk Bets the House of Tesla on Low Prices and Razor-Thin Margins Carvana Was Built for Low Interest Rates.

(NYSE: SPOT) reported a record first-quarter user growth but a soft ad business resulted in lower-than-expected revenue.\n\nRecord User Growth\n\nAccording to CEO Daniel EK, this was Spotify\u2019s second largest quarter of user growth since inception,\u00a0with\u00a0the result exceeding its own expectation by 15 million.\u00a0As of March 31st, Spotify\u2019s userbase soared to 515 million as it rose 22 percent since last year, and 5 percent since last quarter, leaving behind Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) whose Apple Music is expected to reach 110 million subscribers by mid-decade. However, Apple does not announce its user numbers regularly, so this is an estimate from JP Morgan\u2019s report and Apple does not comment on estimates. Apple officially issued numbers for its music business back in 2019 when Apple Music exceeded 60 million subscribers. Among those 515 million monthly users, Spotify has 210 million paid subscribers as they increased 15% YoY, leaving its competitors far behind. Although Google's YouTube had 32 billion monthly users at the end of last year, there\u2019s no direct comparison as Google-owned\u00a0platform hosts much more than music being primarily a user video streaming service. It\u2019s been years since competitors launched their music streaming services, including Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Tencent Holdings Limited (OTC: TCEHY), but Spotify remains at the top when it comes to most paid subscribers in its field. Even the e-commerce titan remained in the shadows with its Amazon Music that is included in Amazon\u2019s main subscription. With its massive library that counts more than 100 million songs and podcasts, along with giving users the ability to add their own music, Amazon serves as an example that Spotify\u2019s magic remains unparallel in the streaming music field.\n\nFirst Quarter Figures Show That User Growth Comes At a\u00a0Cost\n\nUnfortunately, despite the above success, Spotify still posted net loss of \u20ac225 million for the first three months of the year, which translates to about $248 million. Last year, it made a\u00a0net income of \u20ac131 million which translates to about $145 million during the comparable quarter. But still, this is an improvement from the previous quarter, fourth quarter of 2022, when it posted a net loss of \u20ac270 million which translates to about $298 million.\u00a0Margins came in at 25.2%, topping estimates of 24.9%.\n\nStory continues\n\nA Cautious, But Optimistic Outlook\n\nSpotify\u2019s management aims to become more efficient this year and therefore, stricter with spending which is to be reflected sequential margin improvements. Ek\u00a0reiterated that gross margins are expected in the range 30% to 35% over the long term.\u00a0As AI comes into the picture to disrupt the music industry as well, Ek\u2019s sentiment is both cool and scary as the company cautiously but optimistically, continues further scaling its ads and podcasting business.\u00a0Unlike Apple Music and Google\u2019s YouTube premium, Spotify decided not to join price hikes until the timing is right- which will be at some point later in the year.\n\nSpotify Seems To Be Playing The Right Tones, But Business-Wise, It Still Has A\u00a0Long Way To Go\n\nThis is the music streaming service\u2019s strongest quarter since going public five years ago. The boost in subscriber growth and the fact subscriber\u2019s base passed the half billion mark came at a good time after fourth quarter losses and layoffs at the beginning of the year that trimmed its workforce by 6%. Prioritizing user growth comes at a cost that Spotify is clearly willing to pay. Unfortunately, execution of monetization of its business remains murky in this weakening macroeconomic climate as ad softness has hurt revenue. But, shares went up 5% upon the report so the market and investors seem to be sharing Ek\u2019s positive sentiment of Spotify\u2019s prospects.\n\nDon't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

You can skip our detailed analysis of Pakistan\u2019s economic environment and go directly to the Top 5 Companies in Pakistan. The top companies in Pakistan mostly pertain to the petroleum, banking, construction, agriculture, and real estate industries.\n\nOutlook of Pakistan\u2019s Economy\n\nPakistan\u2019s GDP in 2022 amounted to $376.5 billion, an 8.13% increase from 2021. Currently, the country is at risk of default due to a gradually worsening balance of payment crisis over the years. In March 2023, its dwindling foreign reserves reached the rock bottom of $9.76 billion. Consequently, the Pakistani rupee crashed to 288.6 to the dollar in April 2023, down from around 188 during the same time in the previous year.\n\nThe decreasing value of the rupee and the perceived risk of economic default have caused the Pakistani stock market to decline by 20% during the last year, and investors are not expecting their earnings to grow in the foreseeable future. According to a survey conducted by the Overseas Investment Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Pakistan\u2019s Business Confidence Index has decreased by 21% since June 2022, causing various industries and companies such as Airlift to cease their business operations within the country.\n\nThe failure of Pakistan\u2019s economy was triggered by the recent wave of political instability, that started after ex-Prime Minister Imran Khan was ousted from the government. The ouster resulted in mass rallies and protests across the country, which threatened the security of the public and halted business activity. The PDM government, which replaced Khan, assumed office amid sky-high inflation and a staggering external debt of $126.07 billion.\n\nPakistan\u2019s economy is infested with structural issues such as excessive government interference in markets, existence of a large informal economy, insufficient investment in infrastructural and human resource development, inadequate tax revenue generation, and ineffectiveness of governance structures. These issues have led the country to slowed economic growth, high inflation, reduced investments, severe balance of payment crises, and rapidly diminishing foreign reserves.\n\nStory continues\n\nPakistan also ranks among the 10 most vulnerable countries to climate change, which also impedes economic development and is expected to diminish the country\u2019s GDP by 18-20% by 2050. The 2022 monsoon floods, which inundated one-third of the country, inflicted a loss of $30 billion on the economy. As a result, the inflation rate rose to 48.7%, further damaging the purchasing power of an average citizen.\n\nOne silver lining for Pakistan in these bleak economic conditions is the rise of the e-commerce industry, which can help decrease the country\u2019s balance of payment deficit. Less than three years after the launch of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Pakistani sellers earned a third rank among new sellers on the marketplace. Pakistan can further capitalize on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and increase its exports by $6 billion.\n\nSeeing a potential for growth due to this rise in online transactions, Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA) has also set up its office in Karachi, Pakistan. According to sources, Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA) is seeking to increase its revenue by introducing innovative payment technology to Pakistani consumers.\n\nPakistan also has a tremendous potential to earn revenue through digital exports, since its software developers are considered profitable hires by American companies like Turing. To further develop this potential, tech companies like Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) have launched training programs for students. Additionally, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) has also announced 1000 tech scholarships worth $500,000 for youth in the Pakistani province of Balochistan.\n\nEven though giant companies like TikTok and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) are setting up their offices in Pakistan due to increasing consumer demand and legislative requirements, the companies are still displaying hesitance due to political instability and unreliable government policies.

Microsoft and Alphabet reported strong cloud computing revenue, proving businesses are still spending big, but growth has slowed compared to peak rates in 2021. So what does the future look like for cloud tech? And joining us now, we've got Ted Mortonson, who is the Baird Technology strategist. And Ted, great to have you here with us this morning, first and foremost.\n\nWhen I looked at these numbers, and especially zeroed in on Alphabet's numbers particularly, it was noteworthy the growth that they saw in their cloud division, as well as the profitability, even at a time where we were talking about coming into this earnings season it being in an environment of more deals scrutiny. Interested in what you make of that and what this really kind of sets forth in terms of the growth narrative that these companies have really been pitching to the Street and to customers?\n\nTED MORTONSON: Well, I think what you're seeing is you're seeing a rationalization of really cloud spend by the global 2,000. I mean, we had a huge peak due to application loads during COVID. That has moderated. And you can see it both in the Microsoft and Google numbers.\n\nIf you look at Microsoft-- your previous guest summed it up well-- the previous quarter, they grew 38%, they guided to 31%, and they hit that number. And that was better than feared by the Street. They guided forward Azure growth at 26% to 27%. So you're seeing that moderation. This is all before you integrate generative AI so that's a positive.\n\nAs it relates to Google, I would somewhat challenge the thought process that Google is behind. They pioneered AI with DeepMind. And they just rolled out Bard. They're holding a lot of cards here. And I think to some degree, the Street may be leaning one way. These are two brilliant companies with unbelievable managements.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd generative AI is gonna affect every single industry for, you know, the next decade. It's probably one of the largest technology evolutions I've seen in my 30-year career of doing technology. And as an engineer, it is a feat, not only on the silicon side but on the software side.\n\nI think what happens tomorrow with Amazon is incredibly important for the tape. Last quarter, they grew 20%. The Street has a very negative bias on their channel checks on Amazon in relationship to AWS growth. And I think this is gonna be a very important report tomorrow.\n\nAlso, the Street is very, very focused, not only on AWS growth rate, but for Amazon this is a major contributor to operating margin. AWS contributed almost $5.2 billion of profitability last quarter with operating margins of 24.3%. That engine's got to keep going to fuel the investment that Amazon is doing on their core ecommerce.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: So Ted, let's talk about then the three big cloud players, given what you're saying about AWS. Because my read through from Microsoft and Alphabet was that companies are still spending on cloud, right? Not going up at the same rate, obviously. But that spending is not being eroded as much as we might have anticipated, given that it's the, quote-unquote, \"year of efficiency\" for many companies.\n\nAre we not going to see that same effect in AWS? Does AWS not have the same kind of bolt on services for cloud that the other players do? Or could they potentially surprise to the upside, also?\n\nTED MORTONSON: They could. And again, sentiment is pretty negative here on the AWS print. I think with AWS, you also have to realize in their infancy of cloud, the private companies were a very big contributor for AWS. When you were in the Silicon Valley and doing a start up, your cloud infrastructure bill was directly to Amazon.\n\nAnd I think post-Silicon Valley's failure, that smaller component now on the private side is definitely seeing some pressure. Now, with that said, you look at these three clouds-- AWS, Azure, and GCP-- they are true monopolies. They're worldwide monopolies. Outside of China, Baidu, and Alibaba, they're holding 90-plus-percent of the AI engineers. And as you move into generative AI, these three companies are going to be the leaders in a paradigm shift-- not only in search but across all industries as software changes.\n\nAnd Microsoft is incredibly well-positioned because of their enterprise reach. And I think Dan summed it up very, very well where you're-- when you look at Microsoft, they're already commercializing AI with what's called Copilot. And Copilot's being commercialized on the developer with GitHub. It's being commercialized on security with their E5 offering. It's through dynamics.\n\nMicrosoft is actually rolling it out to the enterprise right now and I think that's their core advantage, at least in the near term.\n\nBRAD SMITH: You know, the way of thinking among some of their portfolio clients in the past would be, all right, if we've already got our collaborative cloud suite with this company, then we might as well kind of have a data center that's housed by this company, as well. Kind of just summarizing everything up in one bill, if you will.\n\nIs that still the way of thinking? Are companies looking to piecemeal together a broader kind of cloud solution for themselves? Or are they kind of picking and choosing? And if so, is there a clear winner right now among some of the largest cloud players that you're tracking?\n\nTED MORTONSON: That's the million dollar question and it's a great question. I think if you look at AWS being kind of the number one cloud player, historically, and Azure being number two, and GCP being number three, and Oracle's OCI being a distant four, right now this is a battle between Microsoft and Google. Microsoft, again, has the enterprise, which is a huge advantage. You know, all corporate enterprises, essentially their foundation is Microsoft.\n\nAnd as you look at the roadmap, it is a scary roadmap. It's almost kind of like the technology Deskstar, if you will. Microsoft is an incredibly brilliant management that executes. And in that respect, I think as you move into generative AI-- they've been working with OpenAI for years in a huge investment. OpenAI is powered by NVIDIA, it sits on Azure.\n\nThat's a pretty big initial advantage in this next war. And it is a generational paradigm. So I would say, Microsoft is holding a lot of cards right now.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Just super quickly, Ted, does the lack of Activision affect that Deathstar ability?\n\nTED MORTONSON: No. It's a bolt-on that-- it's a bolt-on, quite frankly, that would have been nice to move their whole gaming business to the cloud. But the core IP within Microsoft is feeling multiple product cycles currently.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: So I guess I don't know what the vulnerability was, that you shoot the photons down into the middle and the whole thing blows up. I don't know what they-- well, the analogy only goes so far. Ted Mortonson, thank you so much. We love that analogy, though.

AMZN may be one such company.

After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings \u2014 with the most up-to-date information possible \u2014 is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for AMZN in this report.\n\nIn fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 25 cents per share for AMZN, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 21 cents per share.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) is heavily dominated by institutional owners", "content": "Key Insights\n\nSignificantly high institutional ownership implies Amazon.com's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions A total of 25 investors have a majority stake in the company with 44% ownership Analyst forecasts along with ownership data serve to give a strong idea about prospects for a business\n\nTo get a sense of who is truly in control of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 59% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.\n\nSince institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.\n\nLet's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Amazon.com.\n\nView our latest analysis for Amazon.com  ownership-breakdown\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Amazon.com?\n\nInstitutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.\n\nWe can see that Amazon.com does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Amazon.com, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too. earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Amazon.com. Our data suggests that Jeffrey Bezos, who is also the company's Top Key Executive, holds the most number of shares at 9.7%. When an insider holds a sizeable amount of a company's stock, investors consider it as a positive sign because it suggests that insiders are willing to have their wealth tied up in the future of the company. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 6.9% of common stock, and BlackRock, Inc. holds about 5.8% of the company stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.\n\nWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Amazon.com\n\nThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.\n\nMost consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.\n\nOur most recent data indicates that insiders own some shares in Amazon.com, Inc.. The insiders have a meaningful stake worth US$102b. we sometimes take an interest in  whether they have been buying or selling.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 31% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nIt's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Amazon.com better, we need to consider many other factors.\n\nI like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past.

Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG) has a market capitalization of $48.081 billion.\n\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy made the following comment about Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:\n\n\"Our February 2021 trades in Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG) and Amazon (AMZN) are illustrative of what we were seeing. We decided to sell our position in DG to fund a new purchase of AMZN. In Figure 2, one can see that DG was trading at a premium to its 10-year average, while AMZN was trading at a significant discount to its 10-year average.\n\nAt this point, we expected DG to be able to grow its EPS at just under a 15% annual rate over the coming five years, given its maturity and more limited ability to grow its store count from its huge base, which was approaching 20,000 stores in the U.S. We expected Amazon to grow its EPS at a greater than 30% pace, driven by the secular growth of e-commerce, cloud computing and digital advertising, while simultaneously experiencing a large margin-enhancing mix shift as its fastest-growing businesses have much higher margins than the company average. The combination of EPS growth and P/E multiple compression we were expecting for each company is laid out in Figure 3 below\u2026\u201d (Click here to read the full text)\n\nStory continues\n\nRishiken/Shutterstock.com\n\nDollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG) is not on our list of\u00a030 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

To skip our detailed analysis of the artificial intelligence sector, you can go directly to see the 5 Cheap AI Stocks to Buy in 2023.\n\nThe artificial intelligence sector has long been a prized area in the technology industry which has transformed the global economy. The sector has wide-reaching applications in a diverse range of industries, such as interactive media and entertainment and even cybersecurity. The AI market is thus highly diverse and immensely large, valued at about $119.78 billion in 2022, as we mentioned in a previous article. This market size can perhaps be best attributed to the importance of AI and machine learning (ML) in the operations of various businesses.\n\nThe Rise of AI and ML\n\nAccording to a report by Rackspace Technology published in February, a survey revealed that AI and ML were second only to cybersecurity when it came to the most important technologies for businesses today. The survey polled about 1420 IT professionals across the globe in several industries, including financial services, manufacturing, retail, hospitality, government, and healthcare. Of all the respondents, 69% of them ranked AI and ML as a high priority in their organizations in 2023. The survey further showed that companies today are using AI and ML to improve processes, predict business performance and industry trends, and reduce business risks.\n\nThe report also showed a focus on sustainability when it comes to these technologies. About 60% of the organizations surveyed noted that AI and ML helped them meet sustainability targets by improving worker safety and security. Another 54% of respondents stated that these technologies aided them in monitoring energy consumption, while 47% of respondents noted that AI and ML enabled predictive analytics for these businesses as well.\n\nInvesting in AI and ML\n\nWith the wide application of AI and ML in a variety of industries and businesses, it is no surprise that investment in these technologies has also been on the rise in recent years. Mega tech companies such as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) are among the biggest investors in AI as they try to ensure they are not left behind in the wake of this rapidly transforming sector. However, the report published by Rackspace Technology also illustrated how these technologies are not exclusively invested in by wealthy global multinational companies anymore. Of the organizations surveyed, the annual investment in AI and ML for these companies is as follows: 22% of the businesses invested up to $100,000, 28% invested between $100,000 to $500,000, 27% of the respondents invested $500,000 to $1 million, and 20% invested about $1 million to $5 million in these technologies. The global average annual investment in AI and ML came up to over $1 million between these organizations alone.\n\nStory continues\n\nBecause of this rising investment in AI and ML, IT leaders continue to see great potential in these technologies today. They believe that AI and ML will help improve innovation, reduce business costs, and enhance business performance. Most businesses today have been using these technologies to meet these goals while also attempting to increase their productivity and revenue streams through AI and ML as well. As such, we have compiled a list of some of the cheapest AI stocks to invest in today.\n\nLet's now take a look at 10 cheap AI stocks to buy in 2023.

(AP Photo/Elaine Thompson)\n\nThat's given Microsoft a perceived leadership position in the AI wars, leaving rival Alphabet's Google (GOOG, GOOGL) playing catch up. Amazon (AMZN), meanwhile, is working to bring generative AI to its services, while Facebook parent Meta (META) is cobbling together teams to kick start its own efforts.\n\nAnd while Microsoft\u2019s stock has seemingly benefited from both the AI hype and overall market rebound after a rough 2022, the company's main growth driver continues to be its cloud computing efforts in its Azure unit.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut that growth has slowed markedly over the last year. In Q3 2022, Microsoft reported Azure growth of 46% year-over-year. But that's since fallen each quarter, landing at 27% in Q3 2023.\n\nPart of the reason for this decline was large customers pulling back on spending as higher interest rates challenged global growth.

For more stocks to buy, head on over to 5 Cheap Reliable Stocks to Buy Now.\n\nThese days investing in the stock market is not for the faint of heart. The bloodbath of 2022, not only in the stock market but also in the cryptocurrency sector, shook the confidence that risk tolerant investors, including the retail sector, had in themselves in the market. The market fell due to a multitude of factors, not the least of which were soaring inflation, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and the interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.\n\nHowever, 2023 provided investors with some respite. For instance, shares of Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), which dropped from $342 at the start of 2022 to a stunning $123 as the year closed for a stunning 64% drop, are now up a whopping 79% year to date and have climbed back up to $193 year to date to claw back some of their losses. Another worst performer stock last year was Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) whose shares started at $336 in 2022 and closed at $120 as the year ended for a similar trading range as Tesla and for an equal 64% drop. However, year to date, Meta's shares are by a similar 64% and are trading around $205.\n\nA central theme for the stock market is whether there will be a recession in the U.S. This is due to the fact that the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes are precisely intended to slow down the American economy in an attempt to bring down prices before they become a permanent part of both the economy and the people's perception. Multiple investment banks and analysts have provided their views on inflation. For instance, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) has one of the latest takes on the matter as in a fresh post in March 2023, the bank had some tips for people who have invested in real estate. The bank published a piece with perspectives from its own analysts and from Moody's to share the likeliness of a recession in the U.S. and how those that had invested in the real estate sector. On the topic of a recession, the bank's research suggests that while a recession can take place later this year, it might be over in three months and last for a maximum of nine months. At the same time, since the recession will be relatively mild, firms that will lay off employees will also position themselves for recovery, and as far as the real estate sector goes, half of the firms expect to maintain their current headcount.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnother fresh take on the recession comes from the chief executive officer of Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) Mr. Brian Moynihan. The executive shared his thoughts at the Financial Review's Business Summit in Sydney at the start of March. At the event, Mr. Moynihan outlined that his bank expects negative GDP growth in the U.S. that will last three quarters that will primarily be dominated by companies slowing down their operations, with the consumer still having plenty of purchasing power. Bank of America's prediction sees the U.S. economy stop growing in the third quarter of this year and end at the start of next year's second quarter. He added that most people won't even notice a recession (kind of the same thing your dentist says before a procedure) since the economic output will drop at most by a single percentage point and could be as low as 50 basis points (0.50%).\n\nLooking at the broader consensus for a recession, a survey from the National Association for Business Economics (NABE) which was released in February 2023 outlined that 58% of the 49 economists polled believed that a recession will take place this year. Crucially, this percentage was similar to the economists that held the same view in a December 2022 survey. Yet still, the number of economists who believe that the economy will enter into a recession by the end of March 2023 was cut in half, with a quarter still believing this to be the case. This shift in the timeline of the recession comes due to the surprising resilience of the U.S. economy with data for the labor market and inflation still hinting at resilience despite the Fed's stunning interest rate hikes. In numeric terms, one third of those polled believe that a recession will start during the April quarter and a fewer one fifth expect it to start in the third quarter.\n\nSince it's all about recession, billionaire Ken Fisher of Fisher Investments compared the current turmoil with that during 1966 and 1967 as he's had the pleasure of having lived in both eras. According to him:\n\nBut if you weren't there, you kind of don't get it. I mean first, the world was still the world. U.S. markets correlated with non U.S markets. All that's been a constant. The U.S. was the world's biggest economy, more so than now relative to the world. But at the time, there was another regional war. And the U.S. spent money on that, other countries not so much, a few. That's very parallel to what's going with Ukraine. Just different players. We were a bit after presidential election. About same amount of time. President then, Lyndon Johnson, was thought to be a moderating force when he was elected but by 1966, there was the beginning of protests and hostility tied to the Vietnamese was and the aftermath of the spending associated with the great society, which in some ways parallels the spending associated with the covid phenomenon.\n\nBecause if you look at a lot of that spending, like a lot of the infrastructure spending, it wasn't spent on infrastructure, it was spent on social stuff. Then too, you had a sudden rise in short term interest rates in the United States and around the world tied to what? Oh yeah! Fighting off inflation! Now mind you it wasn't as big a in 2022, but up to that point, relatively to what the Fed had done, it was big. Then, too, you had people saying in media if you go back and study that we can't have a market bottom because we haven't had capitulation. You remember people saying that in 2022? But the market which in 1966 had peaked in the first week in January, and bottomed in the second week of October, parallels almost perfectly what happened in 2022, where we got a bottom in October without capitulation.\n\nMr. Fisher goes on to add that the categories that did well back then are also similar, and there were similar fears of a 'recession.' However, despite the fears of a recession in 1967, the market ended up doing well.\n\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at some cheap and reliable stocks, with the top picks being The TJX Companies, Inc.

Grainger: Winners Keep Winning", "content": "W.W. Grainger Inc. (NYSE:GWW) is a leading business-to-business (B2B) distributor of maintenance, repair and operations (MRO) products and services. These are necessary for the upkeep and maintenance of various types of facilities, machinery and equipment.\n\nThe company was founded in 1927 by William Grainger, and nearly 100 years later this industry continues to be a vital part of society. Grainger's clientele mainly consists of large enterprises with intricate procurement processes. These companies typically appreciate Grainger's expertise in handling their extensive, complex accounts and offering inventory management solutions with a high-touch approach distinguishes it from smaller industrial distributors and online competitors like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Business.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Sign with GWW. Click here to check it out.  GWW 15-Year Financial Data The intrinsic value of GWW Peter Lynch Chart of GWW\n\nImportantly for shareholders, Grainger has done a great job of achieving steady long-term growth, and it passes Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio)'s $1 retained earnings test with flying colors.\n\nGrainger has evolved\n\nGrainger's business model centers around providing a convenient, one-stop-shop experience for its customers. The company leverages its vast product catalog, efficient supply chain and robust e-commerce solution to facilitate seamless transactions and customer satisfaction. Its online platform has grown in importance in recent years, accounting for a significant portion of the company's sales.\n\nThe rapid expansion of e-commerce has heightened competition due to increased price transparency and access to a broader range of suppliers. As consumers increasingly preferred online and electronic purchasing methods, Grainger made significant investments to enhance its online capabilities and reorganize its distribution network. In fact, the new Zoro.com by Grainger surpassed $1 billion in sales in 2022 even though it has zero Grainger branding.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to Morningstar, Grainger is now the 11th-largest e-retailer in North America, offering offered more than 1.7 million SKUs in its product catalog. In fact, between 2010 and 2021, the company reduced its U.S. branch network from 423 to 246 while adding distribution centers in the U.S. to accommodate the growing volume of direct-to-customer shipments. This has helped curb operating costs, which is good because the company has needed to become more competitive on pricing, which was offset by an increase in volume. So, while the gross margins have fallen a few percentage points over the last decade, Grainger still maintains a healthy 38% gross profit margin versus the sector median 30%\n\nSlow and steady growth\n\nOver the past decade, W.W. Grainger experienced consistent revenue growth, with only a few minor slowdowns. The company concluded 2022 on a strong note, with sales rising by 13.2% and 17.0% over the three- and 12-month periods, reaching $3.8 billion for the fourth quarter of 2022 and $15.2 billion for the full year, up from $9.4 billion in full-year 2013. In fact, Grainger has increased sales every year since 2013. Net income did slightly better, rising 95% cumulatively in the last decade from $797 million to over $1.5 billion, equating to $30.06 per share. W.W. Grainger: Winners Keep Winning\n\nGWW Data by GuruFocus\n\nMore importantly, retained earnings grew from $5.8 billion to $10.7 billion, adding $3.38 in market value for every dollar retained. In his 1983 shareholder letter, Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio) described his retained earnings test as follows: ?\"We test the wisdom of retaining earnings by assessing whether retention, over time, delivers shareholders at least $1 of market value for each $1 retained.\" As we can see, Grainger breezes past this hurdle.\n\nGrainger's profitability also showed positive trends during this period, with an increase in both gross and net profit margins. The company's gross margin was north of 44% in 2011, and it remained relatively stable until 2018. Since then, Grainger has focused more on top line growth while remaining lean on operating costs. So, net profit as a portion of gross profit has actually increased from 19% to over 26% in 2022.\n\nRisks to the business\n\nAmazons B2B platform has undoubtedly experienced significant growth over the past decade, but not at the expense of Grainger so far. In contrast to Grainger's vast product assortment, Amazon Business primarily targets small businesses, whereas Grainger's approach is designed to cater to the requirements of large enterprises. Furthermore, Grainger offers supply chain solutions for its customers, whereas Amazon mainly concentrates on order fulfillment. Amazon has achieved substantial growth in the MRO market without needing to make considerable investments in building a high-touch business, but it does show a lot of Fortune 500 logos on its website, indicating it may be starting to gain traction in that area as well. Thats a big risk to Grainger.\n\nModeling future growth potential\n\nGrainger's management has set 2025 sales targets in the $19 to $20 billion range with a 14.5% operating margin estimate. These could change if Amazon really is encroaching on Grainger's market share.\n\nGrainger produced $8.476 billion in net income between 2013 and 2022, pushing $4.88 billion through to retained earnings. The companys market capitalization grew from $17.1 billion in April 2013 to more than $33.6 billion today. If all Grainger did was continue to retain 57% at zero growth, it would tack on $8.8 billion to retained earnings. If the company continued to enjoy that ratio, it could create nearly $30 billion in market value in the next decade If that rate came down to a one-to-one ratio, it might not be worth it, but Id be shocked if the company didnt grow earnings at similar rates in the next decade as the last. At the very least, I would expect it to have a higher ratio than one-to-one.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/w-w-grainger-winners-keep-174814244.html", "symbols": ["AMZ.F", "AMZ.XETRA", "AMZN.MX", "AMZN.US", "AMZO34.SA", "GWW.F", "GWW.US"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.997, "neg": 0.025, "neu": 0.836, "pos": 0.138}}, {"date": "2023-04-25T17:45:05+00:00", "title": "Will Solid AWS Momentum Aid Amazon's (AMZN) Q1 Earnings?", "content": "Amazon AMZN is set to report first-quarter 2023 results on Apr 27.\r\n\r\nThe company is expected to have continued gaining from solid momentum in the rapidly growing cloud market on the back of its cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services (\u201cAWS\u201d).\r\n\r\nWe note that the growing popularity and strong adoption of AWS have been aiding Amazon in generating high margins from the cloud business.

For more companies, head on over to 5 Biggest Cloud Providers by Revenue.\n\nThe boom in the Internet and the rise of computing have provided firms with a variety of new mediums to do business. While traditional businesses were restricted to analog computing and physical processes, these days firms have greater insights into their operations and can manage them even by sitting on opposite corners of the globe. A large part of this change is driven by cloud service providers, which is a diverse set of groups that ranges from firms such as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) that provide computing capacity, to others like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) which provide the hardware that powers the services, and even more such as Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP) and Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) that provide cloud based software as a service (SaaS) business process products.\n\nBroadly speaking, while a couple of firms dominate the cloud market, there are a lot of\u00a0 smaller companies operating in the space as well. The cloud segment is also one of the faster growing industries in the world. According to a research report from Grand View Research, the cloud computing market was worth $484 billion last year and can grow to $619 billion by the end of last year. The sector is further estimated to then grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.1% to sit at a whopping $1.5 trillion by the end of 2030.\n\nWhile we've mentioned some of the largest cloud companies in the industry, there's little talk that specifically looks at some of the smallest companies in the industry. Well, there's detailed coverage of this segment in 10 Cloud Computing Stocks Under $5, with some of the most popular cloud computing providers with a share price less than $5 being Lumen Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:LUMN), VNET Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:VNET), and Edgio, Inc. (NASDAQ:EGIO).\n\nStory continues\n\nBuilding on this, another research report, this time from Fortune Business Insights, has even more optimistic growth estimates for the cloud computing provider market. It believes that the industry was worth $480 billion in 2022 and is estimated to be a trillion-dollar sector by 2029 through growing at a 19.9% CAGR and sitting at $1.7 trillion by the end of the forecast period. The research firm believes that the growth in artificial intelligence and machine learning will stimulate the industry's growth since they are crucial to firms' ability to monitor and analyze their data. It adds that out of the three different kinds of cloud providers, namely public clouds, private clouds, and hybrid clouds, the hybrid segment will be the fastest growing. This is due to the fact that as opposed to large firms such as Tesla, small and medium enterprises will adopt it in the near future in order to streamline their business processes, reduce costs, and improve productivity. Additionally, public clouds, namely those that offer the same products to different consumers, will continue to be the largest portion of the market.\n\nFinally, taking a look at the situation on the ground, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s earnings call for its second quarter of the fiscal year 2023 provides some highlights as executives outlined:\n\nAnd lastly, we are going to lead in the AI era, knowing that maximum enterprise value gets created during platform shifts. With that as the backdrop, the Microsoft Cloud exceeded $27 billion in quarterly revenue, up 22% and 29% in constant currency. Now, I will highlight examples of our innovation starting with Azure. Moving to the cloud is the best way for any customer in today\u2019s economy to mitigate demand uncertainty and energy costs while gaining efficiencies of cloud native development. Enterprises have moved millions of calls to Azure and run twice as many calls on our cloud today than they did 2 years ago. And yet, we are still in the early innings when it comes to long-term cloud opportunity.\n\nAs an example, insurer AIA was able to save more than 20% by migrating to Azure and reduced IT provisioning time from multiple months to just an hour. We also continue to lead with hybrid computing with Azure Arc. We now have more than 12,000 Arc customers, double the number a year ago, including companies like Citrix, Northern Trust and PayPal. Now on to data. Customers continue to choose and implement the Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform over the competition because of its comprehensiveness, integration and lower cost. Bayer, for example, used the data stack to evaluate results from clinical trials faster and more efficiently while meeting regulatory requirements and ASOS chose Cosmos DB to power real-time product recommendations and order processing for over 26 million global customers.\n\nNow on to AI. The age of AI is upon us and Microsoft is powering it. We are witnessing non-linear improvements in capability of foundation models, which we are making available as platforms. And as customers select their cloud providers and invest in new workloads, we are well positioned to capture that opportunity as a leader in AI. We have the most powerful AI supercomputing infrastructure in the cloud. It\u2019s being used by customers and partners like OpenAI to train state-of-the-art models and services, including ChatGPT. Just last week, we made our Azure OpenAI service broadly available and already over 200 customers from KPMG to Al Jazeera are using it. We will soon add support for ChatGPT, enabling customers to use it in their own applications for the first time.\n\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at the world's biggest cloud providers in terms of revenue, out of which the top three players are Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). Biggest Cloud Providers by Revenue\n\nPhoto by Taylor Vick on Unsplash\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of the world's largest cloud providers in terms of revenue, we first cast a wide net and listed all firms that operate in the space, such as those that provide hardware, computing resources, and cloud products built on top of them.

Photo: Getty.\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL)\n\nAlphabet\u2019s revenue likely improved marginally while net income declined in the first quarter, according to analyst estimates compiled by Visible Alpha.\n\nGoogle\u2019s parent company will drop its quarterly financial results after markets close this Tuesday.\n\nInvestors will be listening for the company's outlook on artificial intelligence on the call, as well as advertising and company revenue.\n\n\u201cAI will be front, and centre of big tech earnings calls this week. Both Alphabet and Meta (META) are facing tough times in advertising and will be looking for AI to be their bodyguard in the meantime,\u201d Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Finalto, said.\n\nRead more: FTSE and European markets lower as investors await Big Tech earnings\n\n\u201cAlphabet three months ago reported only the second ever quarterly contraction in advertising sales as advertisers cut spending and competition continues to intensify. Cloud growth at Alphabet remained strong, up 32% to $7.32bn, though this was less than expected. Operating expenses rose 10% to $22.5bn.\u201d\n\nAlphabet, like its Big Tech peers, has undertaken a cost-cutting campaign, unwinding the pandemic hiring spree. The company began mass layoffs in January, cutting 12,000 jobs, or 6% of its global workforce.\n\n\u201cAfter a lukewarm set of figures from Netflix (NFLX) last week, and a sharp year-on-year drop in first-quarter profits from another tech darling, Tesla (TSLA), investors will be looking to five of the MAANAM sextet (or FAANGM group as they once were) to deliver good results and upbeat outlooks and help US equity markets maintain the run that began last October,\u201d said AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould. CEO of Microsoft Satya Nadella. Photo: Abdulhamid Hosbas/Anadolu Agency/Getty\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT)\n\nMicrosoft is seen by investors as one of the most obvious winners in the rapidly emerging AI market, with the stock up 17% this year.\n\nBut the company still faces headwinds, as a decline in cloud revenue could spoil the tech giant's quarter.\n\nAnalysts are expecting revenue to be around $51.1bn (\u00a340.97bn), according to data from Bloomberg.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft helped kick off Big Tech's AI obsession with its multi-year, multi-billion dollar investment in ChatGPT developer OpenAI.\n\nRead more: Microsoft earnings: AI hype could take backseat to cloud growth troubles\n\nTraders are betting that AI adoption will help Microsoft \u2014 which generated just $3.2bn in search revenue last year \u2014 challenge the market dominance of Google.\n\nInvestors will be keen to get some indication of the momentum from its steady stream of products and features integrating OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 and ChatGPT technologies, including Microsoft 365 and Bing.\n\n\u201cAmerica\u2019s S&P 500 (^GSPC) has added $2.4tn in market capitalisation so far in 2023 and just six stocks \u2014 Meta Platforms, Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Netflix, Google\u2019s parent Alphabet and Microsoft has provided $1.6tn of that gain between them, or two-thirds of the total,\u201d AJ Bell\u2019s Mould said.\n\nMicrosoft reports its third quarter earnings after the close of trading this Tuesday.\n\nUBS (UBS)\n\nIn Europe, UBS was among the big quarterly results being digested by investors.\n\nThe Swiss-based investment bank reported a 52% drop in quarterly income after it set aside an extra $665m in provisions for litigation costs relating to toxic mortgages in the US.\n\nIt comes ahead of the lender bracing for the huge challenge of integrating its embattled rival Credit Suisse (CS).\n\nVictoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor, said: \u201cUBS\u2019 update comes a day after Credit Suisse reported its first quarter results in which it suffered heavy outflows in the lead up to the acquisition.\n\nRead more: UK banks: Here\u2019s what to expect from Q1 results\n\n\u201cUBS\u2019 net profit attributable to shareholders hit $1bn versus forecasts for $1.7bn. Nonetheless it enjoyed inflows of $42bn with $28bn in net new money in its wealth management division. However, it warned that \u2018client activity levels could remain subdued in the second quarter.\u2019 Its investment banking unit struggled with quarterly revenue falling 19% and profit before tax down 49%.\u201d\n\nMoreover, the group\u2019s chief executive, Sergio Ermotti, said its share buyback plans have been temporarily suspended rather than cancelled as the group focuses on Credit Suisse first and foremost.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s earnings report was light on details around Credit Suisse, despite hopes for more clarity on what Ermotti is planning for the combined group,\u201d Scholar added.\n\nVisa (V)\n\nVisa is also reporting its quarterly results on Tuesday after the market close where it is expected to deliver steady growth.\n\nThe US company reported better-than-expected results in the last quarter, with net revenues increasing 12% year-on-year to $7.9bn, driven by a 22% rise in cross-border volume and a 5% growth in the payments volume. Additionally, it was boosted by a 10% increase in the number of processed transactions.\n\nZacks Equity Research highlighted that Visa has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports.\n\n\u201cFor the last reported quarter, Visa came out with earnings of $2.18 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.01 per share, representing a surprise of 8.46%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $1.86 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.93 per share, delivering a surprise of 3.76%.\u201d\n\nAs a result, Zacks said recent estimates have been moving higher for Visa.\n\nAnglo-American (AAL.L)\n\nShares in Anglo-American were down 2.15% on Tuesday despite the London-based mining company reporting the same day that overall first-quarter production had risen 9% from a year earlier.\n\nIt said the production boost was buoyed by a 28% jump in copper output from its Quellaveco mine in Peru and improvements in its steelmaking coal operations.\n\nHowever, copper production was still below analysts' expectations, according to Reuters, and was down from the previous quarter due to lower grades at Chilean mines Los Bronces and Collahuasi.\n\nThe company kept its full-year production and unit cost guidance unchanged.\n\nCiti analysts said in a note to clients: \"With mixed results and no change to production and cost guidance, we do not expect meaningful changes to consensus earnings estimates for 2023.\"\n\nWatch: Alphabet and Microsoft earnings: Here\u2019s what to expect from the call<a

Currently Trading at an Attractive Price?", "content": "Polen Capital, an investment management company, released its \u201cPolen Global Growth Strategy\u201d first-quarter 2023 investor letter. A copy of the same can be downloaded here. The fund returned 11.37% net in the first quarter compared to a return of 7.31% for the MSCI ACW Index. Global equity markets were volatile in the first quarter. The market rewarded quality fundamentals in January, and fear of inflation and central bank policy reemerged in February. However, despite the banking crisis, quality fundamentals were rewarded again in March. In addition, please check the fund\u2019s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2023.\n\nPolen Global Growth Strategy highlighted stocks like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in the first quarter 2023 investor letter. Headquartered in Seattle, Washington, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) provides consumer products and subscriptions. On April 24, 2023, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock closed at $106.21 per share. One-month return of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) was 9.22%, and its shares lost 23.80% of their value over the last 52 weeks. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has a market capitalization of $1.09 trillion.\n\nPolen Global Growth Strategy made the following comment about Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:\n\n\"We raised our position in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). During 2022, Amazon\u2019s business experienced revenue deceleration from pre-pandemic levels combined with higher expenses resulting from inflation pressures as well as costs in their fulfillment segment. The fulfillment costs were set in motion during the pandemic when demand overwhelmed their network. More recently, AWS \u2013 along with Azure and GCP \u2013 experienced a deceleration in growth as customers globally feel pressure to optimize their usage in this tough macroeconomic environment. We don\u2019t expect this deceleration to persist for the long-term given the secular trend of companies transitioning to the cloud.\n\nFor long-term investors, we believe this combination provides an opportunity and that Amazon is now poised to re-accelerate revenue growth, of which we are already seeing signs, while expanding margins and free cash flow. With respect to margins, given the fast growth in AWS and advertising, the latter generating almost $40 Billion in sales and growing at greater than 30% recently, the resulting mix-shift could result in operating margins of 10% or higher over time. This level would represent a 5x increase over 2022 levels. In sum, we are capitalizing on what we believe is arguably one of the most competitively advantaged business in the world, which is growing well, poised to accelerate that growth and expand margins, and is trading at an attractive price.\"\n\nStory continues Amazon\n\nPhoto by Bryan Angelo on Unsplash\n\nAmazon.com, Inc.

This week\u2019s list includes Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT, Meta Platforms META, Amazon AMZN and Snap SNAP.\n\nBig Tech Earnings: What to Expect\n\nTech stocks have been standout performers in the market this year, with a combination of favorable developments on the macro front driving this momentum. These factors include improved clarity surrounding an end-point to the Fed\u2019s tightening cycle and efforts from Tech management teams to rein in operating expenses (OpEx) through reduced headcount and other measures.\n\nWith many Tech companies on deck to report March-quarter results this week, the market will be looking for top-line growth trends and whether there is further room for profitability and margin-improvement measures beyond what has been already announced.\n\nThese questions will be front and center in this week\u2019s earnings reports from four of the \u2018Big 5 Tech players\u2019. Alphabet and Microsoft will report after the market\u2019s close on Tuesday (4/25), Instagram parent Meta Platforms will report after the close on Wednesday (4/26), and Amazon will report after the close on Thursday (4/27).\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned OpEx angle, reports from these players will give us the latest trends on the cloud front, particularly from Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft.\n\nDigital advertising has historically been seen as core to Alphabet and Meta, but Amazon has also become a major player in the space. Ad spending likely remained stable in the first three months of the year, but it will be interesting to see how these management teams see trends for the current and coming periods, given the macroeconomic uncertainties. This will have a direct read-through for Snap, which reports Q1 results this week on Thursday (4/27).\n\nAll of these companies are big players in the artificial intelligence (AI) space, with the Microsoft vs. Alphabet rivalry particularly intense. With the initial excitement around ChatGPT and other AI applications now behind us, the questions now center around how these AI capabilities will be monetized through new and existing business models. It is reasonable to expect each of these management teams to spend considerable time on their Q1 earnings calls on their AI offerings.\n\nStory continues\n\nTake a look at the chart below that shows current consensus expectations for this group for the current and coming periods in the context of what they achieved in the preceding period.\n\nAs you can see, the group is expected to have -11.2% lower earnings in 2023 Q1 on +1.9% higher revenues. This would follow the -28% drop in earnings on +1.4% higher revenues in 2022 Q4.\n\nThe group\u2019s phenomenal boost in 2021 partly reflected pulled-forward demand from future periods that is being adjusted last year and this year. As you can see above, the expectation is for \u2018regular/normal\u2019 growth to resume next year, but a lot of that is contingent on how the macroeconomic picture unfolds.\n\nBeyond the big 5 Tech players, total Q1 earnings for the Technology sector as a whole are expected to be down -17.3% from the same period last year on -4.4% lower revenues.\n\nThis big-picture view of the \u2018Big 5\u2019 players and the sector as a whole highlight the earnings growth challenge at present. The Tech space is expected to resume its growth-engine status from next year onwards.\n\nQ1 Earnings Season Scorecard\n\nIncluding Monday morning\u2019s results, we now have Q1 earnings from 90 S&P 500 members, or 18% of the index\u2019s total membership. Total earnings for these 90 index members are down -1.9% from the same period last year on +7.1% higher revenues, with 77.8% beating EPS estimates and 66.7% beating revenue estimates.\n\nWe have a super busy reporting docket this week, with almost 700 companies reporting Q1 results, including 178 S&P 500 members. In addition to the aforementioned mega Tech players, this week\u2019s docket has representation from every sector of the economy.\n\n2023 Q1 earnings are expected to be down -8.3% on +2.2% higher revenues. This would follow the -5.4% earnings decline in the preceding period (2022 Q4) on +5.9% higher revenues.\n\nEmbedded in these 2023 Q1 earnings and revenue growth projections is the expectation of continued margin pressures, which has been a recurring theme in recent quarters.\n\nEstimates for Q1 came down as the quarter got underway, in line with the trend that had been in place since the start of 2022. That said, the magnitude of negative revisions to Q1 estimates was smaller than we had seen in the preceding two periods.\n\nEstimates for full-year 2023 have also been coming down as well, as we have been pointing out consistently in these pages.\n\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>> 2023 Q1 Earnings Season Off to a Promising Start\n\nWhy Haven\u2019t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +6.2 average gain per year.

On a positive note, amid the ongoing supply-chain disruption and staffing shortages within healthcare, the retail pharmacy business has been in high demand, thanks to the exponentially growing demand for distant medical services and remote patient care.\n\nParticularly, mail-order pharmacies are registering growth on account of telehealth and remote monitoring services. Added to this, with digitization, retail industry players are significantly strengthening their omnichannel presence from sole brick-and-mortar dependency. All these are creating unique opportunities for stalwarts within the industry like CVS Health, Walgreens BootsAlliance and Rite Aid, which are investing strategically in easy patient access to prescription and maintenance medications.\n\nHowever, the majority of the retail drug store heavyweights have been southbound due to the ongoing pressure of inflation and labor shortages. Further, unfavorable drug pricing and reimbursement are a burden on this sector. Added to this, with a decline in the severity of COVID-19, the demand for related retail health support has decreased, resulting in a significant drop in pandemic-led revenue generation for the industry players.\n\nLast but not least, perceiving the huge growth prospects of this space, there has been a number of new entries in this industry, increasing the competitiveness of the space. Especially, a stalwart like Amazon\u2019s entry into the retail drugstore space has created a survival issue among the existing entities.\n\nStory continues\n\nIndustry Description\n\nThe Zacks Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry includes retailing of a range of prescription and over-the-counter medications. The broad retail network of companies within the retail pharmacy industry delivers advanced health solutions to patients, customers and caregivers. Over the past few years, the scope of the retail pharmacy and drugstore market has expanded exponentially.\n\nIn North America, some of these entities evolved to add wellness products and groceries to their traditional portfolio of prescription and over-the-counter medications. Looking at the attractive growth potentials of this industry,\u00a0 non-healthcare leaders like Amazon, in 2018, acquired pharmacy delivery startup PillPack to enter the U.S. healthcare space.\n\n3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores Industry\n\nOnline Pharmacy and Mail Order Boom: The widespread shelter-in-place regulations since the beginning of the pandemic have created a significant shift in demand toward mail order and online pharmacies. Experts say that this transition is expected to last even after the pandemic is over. Data claims that COVID-19 has only accelerated the already-growing demand for e-pharmacy and mail-ordered home delivery systems.\n\nGoing by a Patch report, \u201cTwo years ago, 11% of U.S. adult pharmacy customers got their prescription from an online pharmacy, based on a survey conducted by market research firm CivicScience, [.] That figure has been steadily rising over the years, according to Statista.com, an online statistics portal.\u201d With Amazon\u2019s big move into the healthcare space, the retail pharmacy industry entered a new phase of fierce competition. To counter this rivalry, the companies are strategically attempting to gain in size and scale.\n\nIndustry Trend Remains Dismal Amid Reimbursement Pressure: Brand-name drugs, which hold wide profit margins, are protected with a reliable supply chain. However, low-margin generic drugs, which have a fragile supply chain network, have been bearing the brunt of the pandemic-induced economic slump. Drug retailers are also witnessing a constant rise in medicine prices, stemming from the rising cost of raw materials of drugs.\n\nThe industry players are currently grappling with continued pressure from non-reimbursable pharmacy expenses, which are significantly pulling down the mass demand for prescription as well as over-the-counter drugs and vaccinations. It has been widely observed that patients are replacing prescription medicines with low-cost generic drugs.\n\nAmazon's Entry Steals Market Share: A Business Insider report in 2021 came up with the speculation that there have been discussions about Amazon setting up standalone stores in a few locations, including Boston and Phoenix. Further, per the report, which cites insider sources, Amazon is exploring plans to place the pharmacies inside Amazon-owned Whole Foods locations.\n\nEarlier, following its entry, the e-commerce giant grabbed a significant chunk of the online pharmacy market from the legacy retail drug store space. Amazon Pharmacy\u2019s omichannel performance has been significantly robust since the inception. Going by a Viseven report of Jan 5, 2023, Amazon\u2019s omnichannel experiences are the keystone to customer retention that help to cover previous sales reductions.\n\nThis has already significantly increased competition in the retail pharmacy market. Needless to say, the speculation of Amazon planning to enter the Brick-And-Mortar space has come as a major blow to the industry, putting retail pharmacy and drugstore stocks in a tighter spot.\n\nZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright Near-Term Prospects\n\nThe industry\u2019s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates encouraging near-term prospects. The Zacks Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry, housed within the broader Zacks Retail and Wholesale sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #114, placing it in the top 45% of more than 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nWe will present a few stocks that have the potential to outperform the market based on a strong earnings outlook. But it\u2019s worth taking a look at the industry\u2019s shareholder returns and current valuation first.\n\nIndustry Underperforms S&P 500 & Sector\n\nThe Zacks Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry has underperformed the Zacks S&P 500 composite as well as its sector over the past year. The stocks in this industry have collectively lost 27.6% over this period compared with the Retail-Wholesale Sector\u2019s decline of 10.7%. The S&P 500 composite has declined 4.3% over the said time frame.\n\nIndustry's Current Valuation\n\nOn the basis of forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E), which is commonly used for valuing medical stocks, the industry is currently trading at 8.11X compared with the S&P 500\u2019s 18.54X and the sector\u2019s 22.29X.\n\nOver the last five years, the sector has traded as high as 12.03X, as low as 7.53X, and at the median of 9.78X.\n\n3 Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores Stocks in Focus\n\nCVS Health is currently seeing greater engagement in an expanded set of digital health services such as antibody and PCR testing, vaccinations and omni-channel pharmacy. During the last-reported fourth quarter of 2022, the company\u2019s unique digital customers increased by seven million to over 47 million. Its individualized Health Dashboard reached eight million active users and interacted with nearly five million customers daily across the community footprint.\n\nDuring the third quarter, CVS Health launched a new functionality that gives patients more choices and convenience for filling prescriptions. Patients can expedite urgent prescriptions, have visibility into out-of-pocket costs, and track their order status, all before even coming into the pharmacy. Further, the company is launching various new MinuteClinic virtual care services that will be available 24/7 to support women's health.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 revenues indicates a 3.9% rise from 2021. CVS Health, a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, also has an impressive five-year expected earnings growth rate of 7.3%.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nWalgreens Boots continues to make progress in transforming the pharmacy business and the method of delivering healthcare, both through physical stores and digital channels. Currently, the company\u2019s U.S. retail business is demonstrating good momentum through digital and omnichannel growth from the myWalgreens loyalty program, owned brand innovation and alternative profit streams. In the last-reported second quarter of fiscal 2023, the company progressed with the transformation of the pharmacy business and the method of delivering healthcare through physical stores and digital channels.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2023 revenues indicates a rise of 2.6% from fiscal 2022. The long-term expected earnings growth rate is pegged at 3%. Walgreens Boots carries a Zacks Rank #3 at present.\n\nRite Aid is benefiting from the expansion of delivery services to its customers. It has been providing home delivery service to customers with an eligible prescription, with the benefit of zero delivery fees. It is also providing pick-up and drive-through services for prescriptions and over-the-counter products at its stores. It launched the Buy Online Pickup In Store initiative in a bid to offer better drive-through and curbside pickup options.\n\nThe company remains focused on accelerating the growth of riteaid.com\u2019s e-commerce sales and expanding its buy online, pick up at store offerings. Continued strength in on-demand delivery, third-party marketplaces, and buy online, pick up at store options is a positive.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2024 earnings indicates a rise of 5.6% from fiscal 2023. Rite Aid currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.\n\nWhy Haven\u2019t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +6.2 average gain per year.

Investors get a peek at how March's banking sector turmoil impacted two lenders near the center of the crisis, while two U.S. cable news channels announce shock departures by some of their brightest stars.\n\n1. U.S. futures in the red as tech earnings loom\n\nU.S. stocks are seen opening lower on Tuesday, as investors await the release of quarterly results from big global tech names.\n\nBy 05:22 ET (09:22 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 1548 points or 0.45%, S&P 500 Futures traded about 23 points or 0.55% lower, and Nasdaq 100 Futures slipped by 67 points or 0.52%.\n\nOn the docket for earnings this week are three out of the four largest U.S. companies by market value: Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). Microsoft and Alphabet are both slated to report later today, followed by Amazon on Thursday. Facebook-owner Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is also due out on Wednesday.\n\nShares in these firms have risen so far this year, and these results will likely serve as a test to see whether these moves are justified while concerns grow over a slowdown in broader economic activity.\n\nElsewhere, other major brands set to report include PepsiCo Inc (NASDAQ:PEP), McDonald\u2019s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), and Verizon Communications Inc (NYSE:VZ), along with General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) and General Electric Company (NYSE:GE).\n\n2. Depositors flee First Republic\n\nShares in First Republic Bank (NYSE:FRC) shed more than a fifth of their value in postmarket trading on Monday after the San Francisco-based bank said that it saw $100 billion in customer withdrawals last month.\n\nThe regional lender became a focal point during the banking sector crisis in March sparked by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. Customers raced to withdraw funds, fuelling concerns that First Republic would need to offload its mortgage portfolio at a heavy loss to cover the outflows.\n\nStory continues\n\nHigh-profile U.S. financiers and government officials eventually engineered a rescue deal that saw a group of 11 banks place $30B in deposits in First Republic. This helped lessen the slide in quarterly deposits, with the figure falling by $72B.\n\nIn a joint statement, executive chairman Jim Herbert and chief executive Mike Roffler noted that the company's deposit base has since stabilized. They also backed the \"strength of our credit quality and capital position.\"\n\nHowever, First Republic, which has seen shares plummet by 87% this year through to Monday's close, warned that it will slash headcount by about 20% to 25% in the second quarter. It also pledged to pursue \"strategic options\" to reinforce its capital position, and withdrew its financial guidance.\n\n3. \"Challenging\" times ahead for UBS\n\nUBS Group AG (SIX:UBSG) reported a $28B climb in net new money at its key wealth management division as the banking sector turmoil hit its merger partner (and old rival) Credit Suisse (SIX:CSGN).\n\nSwitzerland's largest bank noted that $7B of these inflows came in the final ten days of March following the announcement of its government-brokered acquisition of Credit Suisse.\n\nUBS chief executive Sergio Ermotti, who returned to the helm of the lender in March to oversee the tie-up, faces a mammoth task folding ailing Credit Suisse into its operations. On Monday, Credit Suisse reported CHF 61B- roughly $68B- in outflows over the first quarter, and warned that this asset flight has yet to abate.\n\nErmotti himself flagged that economic conditions remain \"challenging,\" telling Reuters after the release of its latest earnings that \"things are going to be hard.\"\n\nTo complicate matters even more, net profit attributable to UBS shareholders fell by 52% in the first quarter after the bank took out $665M in provisions to cover costs related to litigation surrounding U.S. residential mortgage-backed securities that were at the center of the global financial crisis some fifteen years ago.\n\nShares in UBS dropped by more than 4% in early European trading on Tuesday.\n\n4. Big changes in U.S. cable news\n\nTwo long-time stars of U.S. cable news are leaving their perches in a fresh shake-up in the country's television media landscape.\n\nHost Tucker Carlson has parted ways with Fox News, the network announced on Monday, putting an end to a more than decade-long career as one of the channel's most prominent voices.\n\nCarlson's departure comes after Fox News paid $787.5M last week to settle a legal dispute with Dominion Voting Systems, which had accused it of airing false claims that it rigged its voting machines in favor of Joe Biden during the 2020 U.S. presidential election.\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, citing sources familiar with the matter, Fox News executives had taken issue with comments from Carlson that were revealed during the course of the Dominion lawsuit which they viewed as derogatory.\n\nShares in Fox Corp. (NASDAQ:FOX), the owner of Fox News, dropped on Monday.\n\nMeanwhile, Fox News rival CNN said that 17-year veteran anchor Don Lemon is departing the channel.\n\nCNN did not provide further details, but the decision follows controversy sparked by recent comments made by Lemon about Republican presidential hopeful Nikki Haley. Lemon said Haley was not \"in her prime,\" a remark that was later criticized for being sexist.\n\n5. Oil steadies as key Chinese holiday approaches\n\nOil prices mostly stabilized, with traders eyeing a possible rebound in demand in China as the second-biggest economy nears a crucial holiday period.\n\nBookings in China for trips abroad during the upcoming May Day holiday showed signs of recovery from strict COVID-19 pandemic rules. Although the figures are still below pre-pandemic levels due to elevated fares for long-haul flights, investors are trying to gauge how the trend will help support fuel demand in the world's largest oil importer.\n\nContributing to sentiment as well is the prospect of further interest rate rise in the West, which could weigh on economic growth.

AWS accounted for 14% of Amazon\u2019s total revenue during Q4 and increased 4% from third-quarter cloud revenue of $20.5 billion. However, this was slower than many analysts expected and a notable decline from the 27% YoY growth rate in the third quarter. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s cloud revenue grew by 22% year over year during its most recent fiscal second quarter at $27.1 billion. This accounted for 51% of the company\u2019s total revenue and represented 5% growth from $25.7 billion in Q1 cloud revenue but below the 24% YoY growth rate for the first quarter. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMicrosoft Q3 Preview\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s fiscal third-quarter earnings on April 25 are expected to be virtually flat YoY at $2.22 per share.

The Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction (ESP) indicates that Microsoft should reach its Q3 earnings expectations with the Most Accurate Estimate also having third-quarter earnings at $2.22 per share. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nOverall, Microsoft earnings are now expected to be up 1% this year and jump 13% in FY24 at $10.54 per share. Total sales are forecasted to rise 5% in FY23 and edge up another 10% in FY24 to $229.88 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon Q1 Preview\n\nAmazon\u2019s fiscal first-quarter earnings on April 27 are also expected to be flat YoY at $0.21 per share with sales projected to rise 7% to $124.77 billion. Notably, the Zacks ESP indicates Amazon could beat its Q1 earnings expectations with the Most Accurate Estimate having first quarter EPS at $0.25. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAnnual earnings are anticipated to rebound and soar 90% in FY23 at $1.35 per share compared to EPS of $0.71 in 2022. Fiscal 2024 earnings are expected to climb another 61% at $2.18 per share. On the top line, sales are forecasted to rise 8% this year and jump another 12% in FY24 to $625.41 billion.\n\nPerformance & Valuation\n\nYear to date Amazon is up +26% to beat Microsoft\u2019s +17% with both topping the S&P 500\u2019s +8% and the Nasdaq\u2019s +15%. Even better, over the last decade, Microsoft\u2019s +787% and Amazon\u2019s +733% have easily topped the broader indexes. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAt $281 per share, Microsoft stock trades at 30.7X forward earnings which is not far above the industry average of 27.4X. Furthermore, Microsoft is an industry leader and trades nicely beneath its decade high of 37.4X but above the median of 24.5X.\n\nIn comparison, Amazon trades at $106 per share and 79.3X forward earnings which is well below its extreme decade-long high and a 37% discount to the median of 126.5X.\n\nHowever, Amazon still trades much higher than its own industry average of 21.6X but is the leader in its space and Wall Street has historically been ok with paying a premium for the company due to its growth and expansion.\n\nTakeaway\n\nGoing into their quarterly reports, Microsoft and Amazon stock land a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). There may be more upside for both tech giants' stocks this year but this could largely depend on their quarterly results showing they can sustain cloud growth along with expansion in other business areas.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Its chip technology is the backbone of the 5G sphere, positioning Qualcomm for long-term success ahead in the sector.\n\nIts business had been on a roll until its most recent quarter, generating double-digit revenue growth. The lackluster results in the first quarter were due to a cyclical slowdown in mobile-phone sales and supply-chain challenges. Consequently, it reported a 12% drop in sales year-over-year to $9.46 billion and a 27% decline in net income to $2.68 billion. Nevertheless, its long-term prospects remain as bright as ever, with the stock likely to bounce back with aplomb in the upcoming quarters. Forward estimates point to an 8% increase in revenue and EBITDA growth.\n\nDespite a recent surge in QCOM stock, its trades at just 3.5 times forward sales estimates, a rarity for a tech giant of its caliber.
