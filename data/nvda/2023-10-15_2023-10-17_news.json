Excluding auto sales, retail sales were up 0.6%.\n\n\"Retail sales defied expectations with a large September gain, putting consumer spending on very strong footing entering into Q4,\" says Jonathan Millar, senior U.S. economist at Barclays. \"The latest print comes on top of a series of stronger-than-expected readings for nearly all major indicators since the September Federal Open Market Committee meeting,\" Millar adds.\n\nStill, according to CME Group, futures traders are pricing in an 88% chance the Fed will keep interest rates unchanged at its upcoming meeting, slightly higher than the 87% probability from one week ago.\n\nBank stocks mixed after earnings\n\nOn the earnings front, Bank of America (BAC, +2.3%) and Bank of New York Mellon (BK, +3.8%) closed higher after both financial firms reported higher-than-expected third-quarter earnings.\n\nDow stockGoldman Sachs (GS), on the other hand, fell 1.6% after earnings.

The Biden administration expanding its curbs to prevent China, as well as Iran and Russia, from getting the upper hand in AI technology, and potentially using it to strengthen their militaries. Joining us now is Stacy Rasgon, who's Bernstein Research Senior Analyst.\n\nAnd Stacy, it's good to see you. I can think of no one better than to help us figure out what this all means. And you were doing that in your note that you put out today in the wake of this being released, trying to figure out what the effect is going to have. What's the bottom line? What do investors need to know?\n\nSTACY RASGON: Yeah. So it looks to me-- and again, this is our first early read. This thing is 300 pages long. So we do the best we could.\n\nHowever, it looks to me that most of the current mainstream data center GPUs that are getting sold into China are likely to come underneath a control regime. They're going to be subject to export controls. And likely, sales will be curtailed, unless and until the company can get a license to ship. And frankly, I wouldn't hold my breath on that.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo parts that NVIDIA has been shipping, actually, that were workarounds from some of the controls that were put on last year. They brought in products that were specific for the China market, that were designed to come in underneath the control thresholds a year ago. These new regulations close some of those workarounds and loopholes, and block off sales of that.\n\nSo I do think the stuff that NVIDIA has been selling into China as well as, frankly, even parts from Intel and AMD. It's not like they're selling any. But if you look at the specifications of those parts, they're not going to sell any into China. Those are going to come under the controlled regime as well.\n\nJOSH LIPTON: So Stacy, let me ask you this. This is what NVIDIA is saying, in response to this. Given the demand worldwide for our products, we don't expect a near-term meaningful impact on our financial results.\n\nSo maybe, that gives comfort to some traders, Stacy. But let's say you're an investor, and you're listening to this. Should you be concerned about what this is going to mean long-term for NVIDIA?\n\nSTACY RASGON: Well, sure. So you're right. They don't have any near-term impact. And that's because demand is off the charts.\n\nAnd the stuff that they were selling into China was almost the same as what they were selling elsewhere. There were only some few minor tweaks. And so, they can redirect that stuff. There's plenty of demand. Their backlogs are very high.\n\nBut long-term, yeah. Look, even the company themselves. NVIDIA has come out and said, if this stuff continues, that over the long term, the China TAM will likely be impaired. And I think that is the case. Now my own opinion, though, is that was-- is going to happen, anyway.\n\nSo let's imagine a scenario where these control thresholds, they're getting lowered today. Let's say that they were not lowered. Fine. They're never going to raise them, though. They're never-- as far as I can tell, the US government is never going to make it easier to ship stuff into China.\n\nBest case, these thresholds stay where they are. And the gap over time between what is legal to sell in China versus the rest of the world is going to get bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger, as we go along. And eventually, the stuff-- even the stuff they're selling today would be noncompetitive in anyway.\n\nSo my own opinion is that the China TAM for this is likely already to have been impaired. The question is, is this going to happen quickly or slowly? Looks like it's probably happening quicker. Maybe that's a good thing. You can rip the Band-Aid off.\n\nI do believe that over the long term, the overall opportunity is still very large, with or without China. But yeah. It's not like it's a positive. It's not.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/video/biden-admin-expands-curbs-shipments-200727576.html", "symbols": ["A1MD34.SA", "AMD.F", "AMD.MX", "AMD.US", "AMD.XETRA", "INL.F", "INL.XETRA", "INTC.MX", "INTC.US", "ITLC34.SA", "NVD.F", "NVD.XETRA", "NVDA.MX", "NVDA.US", "NVDC34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.995, "neg": 0.034, "neu": 0.875, "pos": 0.091}}, {"date": "2023-10-17T19:58:00+00:00", "title": "Nvidia Stock Takes a Hit Amid China Restriction News - Time to Buy the Dip?", "content": "This year\u2019s leading stock, Nvidia NVDA took a hit Tuesday in trading after the Biden administration announced plans to halt semiconductor shipments to China.

TradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nBiden Cuts Off China\n\nThe Biden administration announced its decision to stop shipments of advanced artificial intelligence chips, specifically those designed by Nvidia and other companies, to China. This move is part of a broader effort to prevent Beijing from accessing state-of-the-art U.S. technology that could enhance its military capabilities. These new regulations will further limit the export of advanced chips and tools associated with chipmaking to countries including Iran and Russia.\n\nNvidia, a leading AI chip designer, reported its compliance with the new regulations and does not foresee an immediate significant financial impact. However, its shares dropped by -5%, and other chipmakers like Advanced Micro Devices AMD and Intel INTC also experienced stock declines.\n\nIndustry Leader\n\nAfter releasing its Artificial Intelligence infrastructure products earlier this year, Nvidia has set itself apart from the industry. Now years ahead of the competition regarding its AI hardware and software, Nvidia stock has far outperformed competitors Intel and Advanced Mico Devices, as well as the industry.\n\nAlthough Intel has struggled in recent years, it has been receiving some earnings estimates upgrades, boosting the stock to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating. However, AMD has not convinced analysts to revise it earning higher as it currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating, indicating mixed earnings revisions.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nWhile many traders have been shaken out of their position on this surprising news, Nvidia still looks appealing at these levels.

Those measures were considered important because AI systems require chaining together thousands of chips at time to chew through huge troves of data.\n\nNvidia , the top AI chip supplier, responded by creating chips that stayed just under the communication limits for the Chinese market but that still proved useful for AI work.\n\nOn Tuesday, U.S. officials said they would focus on computing power alone, which has the effect of controlling a broader range of chips - including Nvidia's recent creations for China.\n\nThe new rules also require chip companies to notify U.S. authorities when they are selling chips that fall just below the restriction limits so that officials can track whether those chips are being used in large quantities for AI work.\n\nCLOSING 'CHIPLET' LOOPHOLES\n\nAnother issue that U.S. regulators sought to address is a new technology known as \"chiplets\" in which smaller sections of a chip are joined together to form a full chip. Analysts had expressed concern that Chinese firms could use such technology to acquire chiplets that stayed within the legal limits but that could later be assembled in secret into a larger chip that would break the rules.\n\nThe new rules imposed a \"performance density\" limitation that aims at preventing such workarounds.\n\nStory continues\n\nBLACKLISTING CHINA'S NVIDIA CHALLENGERS\n\nChip industry watchers believe that if U.S. AI chips are banned in China, Chinese firms will seek to fill the void in the market.\n\nOn Tuesday, U.S. officials added two leading Chinese chip startups, Biren and Moore Threads, to a U.S. trade blacklist. Both Biren and Moore Threads were co-founded by former Nvidia employees in China and were believed to be China's leading candidates to produce domestic alternatives to Nvidia's chips.\n\nTheir addition to what is known as an entity list could hobble the startups because it cuts them off from having their chips manufactured by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co or other leading chipmakers that use U.S. equipment.\n\nRED FLAGS FOR CHIP FACTORIES\n\nThe U.S. said that any chip that contains 50 billion or more transistors, the tiny switches at the heart of all computing chips, and uses what is called high bandwidth memory, presents a \"red flag\" an exporter should consider when deciding if they need a license to ship goods to China. That threshold would encompass nearly all advanced AI chips and is aimed at helping chip factories spot efforts to work around the rules.\n\nEXPANDED REACH\n\nU.S. officials expanded the license requirements for exporting advanced chips from China and Macau to all 22 countries on which the U.S. maintains an arms control embargo. The officials also extended the controls to any company whose ultimate parent company is headquartered in one those countries in an effort to prevent offshore subsidiaries from buying up banned chips.\n\n(Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by Marguerita Choy)", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/factbox-us-cut-off-china-185630010.html", "symbols": ["NVD.F", "NVD.XETRA", "NVDA.MX", "NVDA.US", "NVDC34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.956, "neg": 0.047, "neu": 0.871, "pos": 0.082}}, {"date": "2023-10-17T18:30:00+00:00", "title": "Nvidia\u2019s AI Backlog Will Spare Pain From China Bans\u2014For Now", "content": "Everyone wants Nvidia\u2019s latest chips.

This could mean that obtaining loans may become more accessible, which usually signals positive growth prospects for various industries.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSo, it is now time for investors to step in and invest in growth stocks that can deliver substantial earnings growth in the upcoming years. Here are the top 7 growth stocks that you can\u2019t ignore.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)\n\nSource: rvlsoft / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith technical advancement and the commitment to research and development, Alphabet is the leading company in the AI world. It never disappoints its shareholders, and it remains a solid bet for both long-term stability and potentially high returns.\n\nAlphabet\u2019s stock price has soared by a huge 50% this year. That\u2019s a lot better than the general stock market, which has grown by just 15%. The company earned $1.44 per share in the second quarter of this year and expected the same amount in the third quarter. Analysts are calling for 7.7% revenue growth this year and 11.4% revenue growth in 2024.\n\nFor now, I believe it is an opportune time to invest in Alphabet, as the stock is well-positioned for potential gains in the coming year.\n\nNvidia (NVDA)\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Nvidia, a leading player in the AI chip market, has been experiencing a significant boom in sales. The company is estimated to sell over half of a million of its high-end GPUs in 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company earned revenue of $6.7 billion, up 3% from a year ago in the second quarter of 2023. Analysts at Goldman Sachs have a price target of $800 on NVDA stock, representing potential upside of nearly 100% from current levels. Goldman Sachs believes that Nvidia is well-positioned to benefit from a number of long-term trends, such as the growth of gaming, artificial intelligence, and self-driving cars.\n\nNvidia has a solid history of being both innovative and profitable. However, PC and gaming markets have cooled down a bit since the pandemic, and the crash in the cryptocurrency market did affect graphics card sales. But Nvidia stood firm regardless, and now the company is in a strong position for the long run.\n\nSo, if you\u2019re thinking about where to invest, NVDA stock is definitely worth considering.\n\nAmazon (AMZN)\n\nSource: Mike Mareen / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is widely recognized as the platform for e-commerce and continues to be a hugely profitable entity. But this is a down period for Amazon. Its stock dipped 5% over the past month, creating an opportunity to buy Amazon stock.\n\nDespite a brief slowdown, its online store sales have picked up again with a 7% increase, and reported $134.4 billion in revenue for Q2. For the third quarter, Amazon expects sales of between $138 billion and $143 billion, or growth of between 9% and 13%. Analysts were expecting revenue of $138.25 billion, according to Refinitiv.\n\nFurthermore, PandaForecast.com predicts Amazon\u2019s stock will climb to $146 in the first half of next year and end the year around $206.58. Despite some challenges, Amazon\u2019s adaptability and growth make it an interesting option for potential investors.\n\nTesla (TSLA)\n\nSource: Arina P Habich / Shutterstock.com\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is a leading company in the world of electric vehicles. But 2022 was not a great year for Tesla. Its stock was down due to many factors, including inflation. However, thus far in 2023, Tesla shares are up nearly 140%.\n\nIn the second quarter, Tesla produced 479,700 cars and delivered 466,140 of them, resulting in a substantial $21.3 billion in\u00a0revenue, a 46% increase from the previous year. When factoring in revenue from solar panels and batteries, its total revenue reached $24.9 billion, marking a 47% rise.\n\nHowever, Tesla faced a problem in the third quarter. It delivered 435,000 cars, slightly below expectations. Tesla attributed this to a brief production line pause for upgrades. However, it remains committed to its goal of delivering 1.8 million cars by year-end. This makes it a great growth stock to buy for investors.\n\nNetflix (NFLX)\n\nSource: izzuanroslan / Shutterstock.com\n\nNetflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), the biggest name in the streaming world, has approximately 240 million paid subscribers. Despite this impressive number, there\u2019s still significant room for growth, considering there are around 500 million homes in the U.S. equipped with smart TVs.\n\nIn the first half of 2023, Netflix showed a strong performance. The company generated total revenue of nearly $8.19 billion in the\u00a0second quarter of 2023, an increase from about\u00a0$7.97 billion in the corresponding quarter of 2022. This continued growth is indicative of Netflix\u2019s formidable presence in the market.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s worth noting that there has been a slowdown in new user acquisition. Despite this, existing subscribers are using the service more frequently, which is positively impacting Netflix\u2019s bottom line.\n\nAccording to Seeking Alpha, \u201cNetflix\u2019s third-quarter 2023 revenue is expected to be in the range of $8.46 billion to $8.66 billion, up 8.9% year-over-year and 3% higher than analysts\u2019 expectations for the previous quarter.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, Netflix has implemented some strategies to boost its subscribers and manage costs. One of the major operations is a password-sharing crackdown. Investors will be anticipating an update on this during its Q3 report.\n\nBlock (SQ)\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.com\n\nBlock (NYSE:SQ), formerly recognized as Square, offers an extensive portfolio of financial services, ranging from Cash App to point-of-sale solutions. It also anticipated significant changes in consumers\u2019 preference for digital payments, online shopping, and increasing comfort with cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC-USD), and positioned itself early in the market.\n\nThe company has performed very well in the second quarter of 2023, with a net revenue of $5.53 billion.\n\nFuture growth is expected to be driven by a number of factors, including the continued growth of digital payments, the increasing popularity of cryptocurrency, and the expansion of Block\u2019s Cash App and Square ecosystems.\n\nSalesforce (CRM)\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nSalesforce (NYSE:CRM) is a rapidly growing, cloud-based customer relationship management software company that has demonstrated a strong growth trajectory with a compound annual revenue growth (CAGR) of 29% over the past 10 years. Salesforce holds nearly 20% of the market. Its solid standing suggests a bright future, further backed by estimates of annual growth in earnings by 32.2% and revenue by 10%.\n\nOver 150,000 big companies, like those in the Fortune 500, are showing trust in Salesforce. It is acquiring and partnering with other companies to add to its arsenal, making it even more of a powerhouse.\n\nFurthermore, Salesforce\u2019s early 2023 update was packed with numerous new features that can help businesses cut costs. With these updates, Salesforce has become a more attractive option for companies looking to step up their game.\n\nOn the date of publication, Nauman Khan did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

ADTN recently issued preliminary third-quarter 2023 results. These initial unaudited financial metrics provide valuable insight into the company\u2019s business operations and market trends for the September quarter.\r\n\r\nDuring the quarter, ADTRAN witnessed solid customer addition in the U.S. and European markets, backed by its comprehensive product portfolio. Despite these gains, the company\u2019s net sales were adversely affected by foreign exchange fluctuations owing to its international footprint. A stronger U.S. dollar particularly impacted sales generated outside the United States.\n\nFor the third quarter, the company expects revenues to be $272.3 million. The preliminary figure is lower than the company\u2019s guidance range of $275-305 million. Against the backdrop of a volatile economic environment, cautious capital spending from customers and inventory adjustments had an impact on the top line.\r\n\r\nThe conservative capital spending behavior of consumers resulted in a GAAP operating loss of $82.1 million with a negative operating margin of 30.2% during the quarter. For the third quarter, ADTRAN had earlier estimated the non-GAAP operating margin within the range of -5% to 0% of revenues. Per the preliminary results, the third quarter tally for non-GAAP operating margin is expected at -1.9% or an operating loss of $5,111 million. This figure aligns with the higher end of the company's expectations, supported by improved operational efficiency and a higher non-GAAP gross margin.\r\n\r\nTo successfully navigate through the current uncertain situation, ADTRAN is taking initiatives to better align its operating model. Management remains optimistic about the company's ability to capitalize on a potential return to normalize spending behavior owing to its broad portfolio and diverse market presence.\r\n\r\nADTRAN continues to benefit from solid demand trends of its network solutions, driven by the accelerated expansion of fiber-to-the-home networks, upgrades to in-home Wi-Fi connectivity and the adoption of cloud-based automation tools. The company\u2019s end-to-end solutions simplify the deployment of fiber-based broadband services and provide a better customer experience.\r\n\r\nIt is focused on being a top global supplier of access infrastructure and related value-added solutions from the Cloud Edge to the Subscriber Edge through a broad portfolio of flexible hardware and software network solutions. These products enable a seamless transition to the fully converged, scalable, highly automated, cloud-controlled voice, data, Internet and video networks of the future.\r\n\r\nADTRAN expects solid traction in its domestic markets for ultra-broadband and fiber-to-the-home solutions, along with Software-Defined access and Ethernet passive optical network solutions. The company also anticipates a pickup in capital spending in Tier-1, Tier-2 and regional service provider market segments. Its global leadership in software-defined access is likely to ensure a steady stream of revenues as it helps clients reduce costs and accelerate service delivery and deployment.\r\n\r\nThe stock has lost 63% in the past year against the industry\u2019s growth of 24.9%.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nADTRAN carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStocks to Consider\n\nUbiquiti Inc.

Although they\u2019re technically a non-event, a stock split is seen as a bullish indicator. They indicate management is confident in the company\u2019s future growth prospects. Making the stock more affordable and liquid means shares will be available to more people.\n\nOf course, stock splits are meaningless in terms of the company. Shareholders end up with 12 slices of pizza instead of six. They have two $5 bills in their wallet instead of a $10 bill. Rearranging the number of shares and their price tells you nothing about the business.\n\nStill, since Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) reignited the stock split market by splitting its shares 4-for-1 in July 2021, a number of other big-name companies also split their shares. Most are handily beating the S&P 500 since the date of the split. A few, like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), are significantly underperforming the index.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThree stock-split stocks that divvied up their shares over the past year or so still have tremendous value to unlock for shareholders. If the stock market rebounds in the fourth quarter as some analysts suggest, these are companies you want to buy now.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW)\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAccording to virtual private network (VPN) provider SurfShark, since 2021 the number of cybercrime victims increased 16-fold to 91 victims every hour. The cost of cybercrime increased an eye-bleeding 570 times, hitting $1.2 million per hour. Like death and taxes, hackers apparently will always be with us.\n\nThat gives Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) a target-rich environment to sell its products protecting data. It\u2019s certainly finding an audience of willing customers. Fiscal year 2023 revenue soared 25% to $6.9 billion and it turned a $267 million net loss in 2022 into a $440 million profit this year.\n\nBillings grew 23% to $9.2 billion as Palo Alto Networks develops new and innovative platforms to drive annual recurring revenue (ARR). Its Cortex platform is an artificial intelligence-driven service for threat detection and prevention. It achieved $1 billion in ARR in the fiscal third quarter. Its secure access service edge platform just achieved ARR of $1 billion in the fourth quarter. Growth in ARR indicates customers like what they\u2019re getting and are coming back for more.\n\nStory continues\n\nPalo Alto Networks split its stock 3-for-1 in Sept. 2022. Since then shares grew 43% compared to a 10% gain by the S&P 500. The stock is up 87% this year alone. With an unending need for its services, the sky is truly the limit for this cybersecurity leader.\n\nAmazon (AMZN)\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) hasn\u2019t quite run away with it in the same way since its 20-for-1 stock split in June 2022. Shares are only 9% higher since then versus a 6% gain for the broad market index. Still, the online retailer is among the stock split stocks worth buying.\n\nObviously, its internet retailing operations are top notch. It just completed its Prime Big Deal Days and it outpaced last year\u2019s event. According to Amazon, Prime members bought over 150 million items from third-party sellers, a 50% increase from last year.\n\nYet the numbers also show consumers are feeling the pinch of persistent inflation. Data analytics firm Numerator says 60% of the items purchased were for less than $20 while just 4% were for more than $100.\n\nBut Amazon is integral to the economy. It accounts for nearly 40% of all online retail sales in the U.S. It does face some headwinds from federal regulators suing the retailer for various alleged trade practices, but it\u2019s not enough of a concern to sink the company.\n\nInvestors should note the real growth opportunity is in its cloud-based business, Amazon Web Services. Long the profit center of Amazon, AWS represents 16% of total revenue, but 84% of total operating profits.\n\nAWS is also the leading cloud services operation globally with a 30% share of the market, according to Canalys. AI could push that higher. With AWS more critical to Amazon\u2019s operating cash flows, which rocketed 74% higher during the period, there\u2019s plenty of growth still to come for the retail behemoth.\n\nCopart (CPRT)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAuto auction operator Copart (NASDAQ:CPRT) is a different kind of used car dealer. Unlike many dealers that buy their vehicles from the public, some 83% of Copart\u2019s sellers are insurance companies. Other sellers include banks, finance companies, charities, and fleet operators. And most of the vehicles it acquires are typically damaged and considered a total loss by the insurers.\n\nYou might not think that would be a viable business, but Copart\u2019s is booming. Revenue jumped 10.5% in FY2023 to $3.9 billion with net profits rocketing 32% higher to $84 million.\n\nThis comes even though market conditions aren\u2019t ideal for used cars. Prices remain stubbornly high. Although that can mean higher profits per vehicle, it also makes insurance companies reluctant to declare a vehicle a total loss. Fortunately, the peak of the market seems to have passed.\n\nKelley Blue Book says used car prices fell 1% in August, with the average reaching $26,251. That\u2019s still historically high and KBB sees it remaining so for some time. Used car prices lag those of new cars. So even as new car prices have returned to last year\u2019s levels, used car prices will take some time to fall.\n\nThat means Copart has some important tailwinds building behind it. It split its stock 2-for-1 in August. Shares are up 3% since then compared to a 5% drop by the S&P 500. With Wall Street looking for earnings to grow 22% a year for the next five years, this is an opportune time to buy into this used car auction house. That makes CPRT a definite contender when it comes to stock split stocks to buy now.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

According to a new report from Accel, AI helped big tech up its market cap by $2.4 trillion in the last year, with companies, including Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft, and Nvidia, of course, seeing their values jump by an average of 36% year over year.\n\nAnd of course, we mentioned Nvidia there-- clearly the big winner of the year as soon as all of this came out. But then you saw every company coming out with some sort of strategy to say that, oh, we're including AI. Even if it wasn't proven yet, it was enough to lift some of these tech stocks.\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: Yeah. Nvidia shares up more than 200% on the year. When you look at some of the other big tech names, we are averaging roughly 36%. But it's worth noting that the first half of the year was about the hype. The latter half, really, is about, well, where exactly is the revenue?\n\nAnd we have seen companies, those valuations, start to come down a little because they haven't necessarily been able to prove out their strategy of that revenue pouring in right away. Nvidia is a different case, because we have seen really strong numbers coming through from there. But you could point to even a name like ARM.\n\nYou look at that roughly $5 billion IPO, so much excitement initially around its potential for AI. But since then, we have seen Wall Street turn a little more cautious on the name because they haven't seen that strategy pan out. So, yes, AI still very much in focus-- companies certainly honing in on the potential opportunity there.\n\nBut we have seen the exuberance pull back just a little because investors are saying, well, show me the money, right? I mean, show me where exactly that revenue is coming in from-- a story, of course, we're continuing to follow there.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/video/ai-raised-big-tech-market-160305991.html", "symbols": ["AAPL.MX", "AAPL.US", "AAPL34.SA", "ABEA.F", "ABEA.XETRA", "ABEC.F", "ABEC.XETRA", "AMZ.F", "AMZ.XETRA", "AMZN.MX", "AMZN.US", "AMZO34.SA", "APC.F", "APC.XETRA", "GOGL34.SA", "GOGL35.SA", "GOOG.MI", "GOOG.MX", "GOOG.US", "GOOGL.US"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.995, "neg": 0.004, "neu": 0.86, "pos": 0.137}}, {"date": "2023-10-17T15:51:32+00:00", "title": "Jim Cramer\u2019s 10 Best AI Stocks", "content": "In this article, we will take a look at Jim Cramer's 10 best AI stocks. To see more such companies, go directly to Jim Cramer's 5 Best AI Stocks.\n\nJim Cramer made some important comments earlier this year when he talked about the importance of investing in individual stocks. There has been a rise popularity of investing in index funds over the past few years. Beginner investors often get advised that investing in individual names is too risky and they are far better off investing in broader market funds. Cramer said in his program that while he recommends investing in index funds, he also urges investors to invest in individual stocks if they really want to make money in the stock market. But Cramer said investing in individual stocks requires care and deep study. In the same program Jim Cramer talked about the importance of investing in AI stocks and named some big companies working on AI products, including Meta Platforms.\n\nAI's GoPro Moment?\n\nJim Cramer is also deeply aware of the hype around AI and how companies are excessively using the AI buzzword to boost their stock prices and rally investors. About a month ago, Jim Cramer on his program wondered whether AI was about to have its \u201cGoPro moment,\u201d drawing a comparison between the hype GoPro enjoyed during its early days and the AI boom of today. Cramer said that there was a time when GoPro stock touched high $90s before tumbling and plunging to new lows and today the stock is trading in single digits ($2.82 as of October 16, to be exact). Cramer said that \u201cI have to find out\u201d when companies would stop rolling out AI stories to boost their stock prices.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article we went through several programs of Jim Cramer and picked AI stocks he\u2019s bullish on. With each stock we have linked to the video in which Cramer talked about the company in question. Some top names Cramer likes include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nStory continues Jim Cramer's Best AI Stocks\n\nJim Cramer's 10 Best AI Stocks\n\n10. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 72\n\nJim Cramer in a program earlier this year said Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) has got the \u201cmojo\u201d when it comes to AI. Cramer specifically likes Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\u2019s partnership with Google to provide AI chips. However, a report from The Information in September, citing sources familiar with the matter, said Google wants to cut its reliance on Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) for AI-accelerating TPU chips as early as 2027.\n\nJim Cramer also said that Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is \u201cnot an expensive stock.\u201d He also referred to price target upgrades and bullish ratings on Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) from BMO, JPMorgan and Evercore.\n\nClearBridge Multi Cap Growth Strategy made the following comment about Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWhile the ClearBridge Multi Cap Growth Strategy has limited mega cap exposure, which has been a recent headwind to relative performance, we own several companies that stand to benefit from the explosive growth in generative AI. These holdings play key roles in building out the necessary infrastructure and helping customers leverage capabilities enabled by this emerging technology.\n\nSemiconductor and software solutions provider Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), for example, is an important supplier of networking chips that power ethernet switches and routers for connectivity between AI servers. The company sees quarterly revenue from this part of their business exceeding $1 billion in their fiscal third quarter, on a trajectory toward doubling over the course of the year.\u201d\n\n9. Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 84\n\nIn the \u201cLightning Round\u201d on his program on CNBC, Jim Cramer, a couple of months ago, answering a question about Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), recommended investors to buy more ORCL stock. Cramer pointed to Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL)\u2019s quarterly earnings earlier this year and the stock\u2019s relative underperformance after that. Cramer at the time said that \u201cright here\u201d is when you should buy Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL). Cramer said by right here he meant $113, $112, $110. As of October 16 Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) is trading at $108. Cramer also believes Oracle is the \u201cstar of the show\u201d in AI.\n\nAs of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 84 hedge funds out of the 910 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL). The biggest hedge fund stakeholder of Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) during this period was Jean-Marie Eveillard\u2019s First Eagle Investment Management which owns a $2.2 billion stake in the company.\n\nLike ORCL, Cramer also loves Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nOracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL)\u2019s CTO Larry Ellison in an earnings call earlier this year talked about AI opportunities for Oracle and said:\n\n\u201cWell, you can\u2019t build any of these AI models without enormous amounts of training data. So if anything, what AI \u2014 generative AI has shown that the big issue about training one of these models is just getting that \u2014 this vast amount of data ingested into your GPU supercluster. It is a huge data problem in the sense you need so much data. To train \u2014 OpenAI to train ChatGPT 3.5, they read the entire public Internet, they read all of Wikipedia, they read everything, they ingested everything. And to specialize, and you take something like ChatGPT 4.0 and you want to specialize it, you need specialized training data from electronic health records to help doctors diagnose and treat cancer, let\u2019s say, and we are partners.\n\nImaging for example, that is ingesting huge amounts of image data to train their AI models. We have our own \u2014 another partner of ours in AI, ingesting huge amounts of electronic health records to train their models. AI doesn\u2019t work without getting access to and ingesting enormous amounts of data. So in terms of a shift away from data or a change in gravities at AI, AI is utterly dependent upon vast amounts of training data. Trillions of elements went into building ChatGPT 3.5, multiple times that for ChatGPT 4.0 because you have to deal with all the image data and ingest all of that to train image recognition. So we think this is very good for our database business, and Oracle\u2019s new Vector database will contain highly-specialized training data like electronic health records, while keeping that data anonymized and private, yet still training the specialized models that can help doctors improve their diagnostic capability and their treatment prescriptions for cancer and heart disease and all sorts of other diseases.\"\n\nRead the full earnings call transcript here.\n\nOakmark Global Fund made the following comment about Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cOracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) (U.S.), a global software company, was the Fund\u2019s top contributor for the fiscal year, with its share price rising primarily after reporting its fiscal fourth-quarter results. More recently, Oracle announced fiscal first-quarter results, which were in line with consensus expectations. The drivers of the core business are performing well, in our view, and management expressed confidence that annual revenue growth will accelerate as planned based on demand trajectory and its strong bookings trends. For the quarter, total revenue increased 8% in constant currency (9% reported), and operating income grew 12% with margins showing improvement. Cloud and support revenue grew 11% in constant currency, powered by Fusion +20% and Netsuite +21%. The \u201cstrategic back office cloud\u201d is now up to $6.9 billion in run-rate revenue. Infrastructure cloud and support revenue grew 14% in constant currency, powered by infrastructure cloud services +72% ex-legacy hosting services to $5.6 billion in run-rate revenue. Momentum is continuing to build as Oracle signed several deals for its cloud business greater than $1 billion in total value during the quarter and booked an additional $1.5 billion in the first week of the second quarter. We continue to believe Oracle is an attractive holding and undervalued due to our perception of its intrinsic value.\u201d\n\n8. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 109\n\nJim Cramer said in a program that Adobe is using the best use of AI and Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is more responsive than any other company when it comes to AI.\n\nAnalysts are praising Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)\u2019s AI features across the board. Baird recently said it is \u201cincrementally positive\u201d on Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)\u2019s artificial intelligence strategy and leadership position.\n\n\u201cWe expect the product roadmap to continually evolve over time with additional GenAI announcements, Baird\u2019s Rob Oliver and Patrick Schulz, who have a $540 price target on Adobe, said.\n\n7. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 112\n\nEarlier this year Jim Cramer said that he\u2019s been recommending Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) since the stock was trading at $5. Cramer praised Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)\u2019s latest AI chips announcements and said that it was bad news for China since Chinese semiconductor companies seem to be struggling to keep up with innovation and American companies won\u2019t be allowed to export AI chips to China.\n\nIn May 2023, Cramer also talked about Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)\u2019s partnership with Microsoft for AI chips and said the deal could have major implications.\n\nIn May, Bloomberg reported that Microsoft was joining hands with Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) to help the semiconductor firm expand into AI, where Nvidia currently dominates.\n\nArtisan Global Opportunities Fund made the following comment about Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cAmong our top contributors were Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), NU Holdings and Netflix. AMD\u2019s data center CPUs are used in the cloud service provider (CSP) servers. In addition to the broader secular tailwind from cloud adoption, the company has a performance and pricing advantage over Intel, which we believe will enable it to continue capturing market share. However, the recent stock price rally was due to growing excitement around the company\u2019s AI exposure. It will launch its new MI300 graphics processing unit (GPU) chip later this year to compete against the dominant market leader NVIDIA. Similar to its approach that won market share from Intel within the CPU market, AMD\u2019s product will aim to provide similar performance at a more attractive price. AMD is already working with Microsoft and Meta, while Amazon publicly stated that it is evaluating AMD\u2019s inferencing chips. Using assumptions around the total GPU market size, potential market share gains and price points, our research indicates this could be a $20 billion opportunity for AMD. That would nearly double its revenue. While the company has not historically missed many deadlines, there is execution risk as it works to manufacture and distribute these complex chips at scale, which, combined with an elevated valuation after the stock\u2019s strong performance run, led us to trim the position.\u201d\n\n6. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 122\n\nJim Cramer in September interviewed Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)\u2019s CEO Marc Benioff at Salesforce\u2019s Dreamforce, where the company revealed several AI offerings. Benioff highlighted the role of Slack, which Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) acquired for about $27.7 billion, when it comes to AI.\n\n\u201cThe big news is Slack is really starting to wake up with its own AI. It holds so much data for our customers. I think Slack is going to be the promise of AI for a lot of our most important customers. If you go talk to any of these great, new AI companies they are all Slack-first companies; they all built their product with Slack.\u201d\n\nCramer is bullish on Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM). His charitable trust has a position in Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM). Cramer recently said during his program that Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) will have a \u201cdynamite\u201d 2024.\n\nHarding Loevner Global Equity Strategy made the following comment about Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cSalesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), a company we\u2019ve owned since 2019, recently added ChatGPT-like capabilities onto its existing Al module, Einstein, to support its internal sales efforts and customer-facing software. For example, Einstein GPT can help generate marketing emails tailored to specific clients by using Salesforce\u2019s customer database and past email correspondence to learn the most effective approach for each client. Einstein GPT is also different from off-the-shelf LLMS in three important ways: It keeps personal identifiable information private and secure, compared with external tools that retain anything a user enters. It employs the latest data in Salesforce\u2019s system, as opposed to the sometimes-stale public data that train generic models. And generative Al capabilities can be integrated with other Salesforce offerings; the company has already introduced Slack GPT and Tableau GPT, Al-equipped versions of its workplace collaboration and analytics tools.\u201d\n\nSome other stocks Cramer likes because of their AI potential include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nClick to continue reading and see Jim Cramer's 5 Best AI Stocks.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n12 Best Upwork Alternatives for Freelancers and Employers Top 20 Countries With Most Natural Resources in the World 23 High-Paying Trade and Vocational Jobs in 2023\n\nDisclosure: None.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the quantum computing industry, head directly to 5 Best Quantum Computing Stocks To Buy Now.\n\nThe International Data Corporation (IDC) released its second projection for the global quantum computing market on August 17, 2023. It anticipates that customer spending on quantum computing will increase from $1.1 billion in 2022 to $7.6 billion by 2027, demonstrating a 48.1% compound annual growth rate over the forecast period. This updated forecast is considerably lower than IDC's earlier quantum computing prediction from 2021. Many factors have negatively impacted customer spending in the short-term, including slower progress in quantum hardware development, the emergence of alternative technologies like generative AI offering more immediate benefits, as well as higher interest rates and the possibility of a recession. IDC believes that the quantum computing market will continue to experience slow growth until there is a significant breakthrough in quantum hardware development that delivers a quantum advantage. In the meantime, most growth will be driven by improvements in quantum computing infrastructure and platforms and the rise of performance-intensive computing tasks suitable for quantum technology. IDC also expects investments in the quantum computing market to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 11.5% from 2023 to 2027, amounting to approximately $16.4 billion by the end of 2027.\n\nOn September 13, 2023, D-Wave Quantum Inc. (NYSE:QBTS)\u2019s CEO, Alan Baratz, joined Bloomberg Television to discuss the potential of quantum computing, the rivalry between the United States and China in this domain, and the significant impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on this field. Ed Ludlow, co-host of Bloomberg Technology, commented that there is a mistaken belief that quantum computing is primarily in the theoretical realm and has not yet made a tangible technological impact. To this, Baratz replied:\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re absolutely right. Most people in the industry are saying that quantum computing is years away from commercial reality but at D-Wave we took a very different approach to quantum computing, one that has allowed us to deliver commercial quantum computers today. In fact, we\u2019ve been delivering them for almost two years now.

While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\n\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Nvidia (NVDA) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nNvidia currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.13, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 36 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.13 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 36 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 32 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 88.9% and 8.3% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for NVDA Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for NVDA\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Nvidia here>>>\r\n\r\nWhile the ABR calls for buying Nvidia, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nStory continues\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\n\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\n\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nIs NVDA Worth Investing In?\n\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Nvidia, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.8% over the past month to $10.74.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Nvidia. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Nvidia may serve as a useful guide for investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Over the years, the company\u2019s focus has evolved from PC graphics to artificial intelligence (AI) based solutions that now support high performance computing (HPC), gaming and virtual reality (VR) platforms.\n\nSince being added to the Zacks Focus List on May 20, 2019 at $39.13 per share, shares of NVDA have increased 1078% to $460.95.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, 15 analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days, and the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $2.91 to $10.74. NVDA boasts an average earnings surprise of 9.8%.\n\nEarnings for Nvidia are forecasted to see growth of 221.6% for the current fiscal year as well.\n\nSince stock prices respond to earnings estimate revisions, it can be very profitable to buy stocks with an increased earnings outlook. By buying a Focus List stock like NVDA, then, you're likely getting into a company whose future earnings estimates will be raised, potentially leading to price momentum.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The Silicon Valley firm is currently selling almost every chip it can procure as worldwide demand outstrips supply, but would be hurt in the long term as Chinese chip firms seek to fill any voids left by U.S. companies.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia's A800 and H800 chips will be hit by the new regulations, due to a change in chip parameters aimed at capturing a greater number of chips.\n\nBut the rules will exempt most consumer chips used in laptops, smartphones and gaming, though some will be subject to licensing and notification requirements by U.S. officials.\n\n\"The fact is, China, even after the update of this rule, will import hundreds of billions of dollars of semiconductors from the United States,\" Raimondo said, emphasizing that the goal of the measures was not to hammer U.S. companies.\n\nThe previous rules imposed a two-pronged test that measured both a chip\u2019s computing performance and its ability to communicate with other chips, an important measure in AI supercomputers where thousands of chips are strung together to chew through huge amounts of data.\n\nNvidia and Intel created special chips for the Chinese market that retained the powerful computing capabilities but limited communications speeds to stay inside the previous rules.\n\nBiren and Moore Thread, whose U.S. suppliers will now face a tough licensing requirement before shipping products to them, are both Chinese startups founded by former Nvidia employees in China and aim to compete with the U.S. AI chip giant.\n\nThe rules released on Tuesday eliminate the communication speed limits and focus on computing performance, which will have the effect of halting sales of Nvidia's A800 and H800 chips for the China market, according to a senior administration official.\n\nU.S. officials on Tuesday added a new measure to restrict chips that exceed a certain level of \"performance density,\" a measure focused on how much computing power can be packed into a given amount of silicon, a senior administration official said.\n\nThe senior administration official said this rule was meant to prevent companies from trying to work around restrictions on full chips by using a technology called \"chiplets,\" where firms could try to join together small pieces called chiplets into a large chip that violates the rules.\n\nReuters reported in July that chiplets have become a core part of China\u2019s technology strategy to advance its chip industry, and analysts have said that Chinese companies could use the technology to evade U.S. restrictions.\n\nLICENSING EXPANDED\n\nThe new measures also expand licensing requirements for exports of advanced chips to more than 40 additional countries that present risks of diversion to China and are subject to U.S. arms embargoes, the officials said.\n\nThat measure appears to build on a letter received by Nvidia in August that it described as restricting shipments of its A100 and H100 chips beyond China to other regions including some countries in the Middle East.\n\nConfirming a Reuters report, chips will be barred from being sent to units of firms located anywhere in the world if their parent companies are headquartered in China, Macau and other arms embargoed countries. The move is part of a bid to keep the chips from being illegally smuggled into China or remotely accessed by Chinese parent companies.\n\nThe Biden administration also hit 21 countries outside China with a licensing requirement for chipmaking tools. It also broadened the list of equipment restricted from going to that country to include some deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography systems.\n\nDUV is less advanced chipmaking equipment than state-of-the art extreme ultraviolent equipment (EUV), which has not yet been shipped to China, but can make chips nearly as advanced at greater cost.\n\nOfficials took pains to stress that Chinese officials were warned the rules were coming by National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, confirming a prior Reuters report.\n\nThe Semiconductor Industry Association said in a statement it was \"evaluating the impact\" of the new rules and urged the administration to work with allies. \"Overly broad, unilateral controls risk harming the U.S. semiconductor ecosystem without advancing national security,\" the group said.

The Silicon Valley firm is currently selling almost every chip it can procure as worldwide demand outstrips supply, but would be hurt in the long term as Chinese chip firms seek to fill any voids left by U.S. companies.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia's A800 and H800 chips will be hit by the new regulations, due to a change in chip parameters aimed at capturing a greater number of chips.\n\nBut the rules will exempt most consumer chips used in laptops, smartphones and gaming, though some will be subject to licensing and notification requirements by U.S. officials.\n\n\"The fact is, China, even after the update of this rule, will import hundreds of billions of dollars of semiconductors from the United States,\" Raimondo said, emphasizing that the goal of the measures was not to hammer U.S. companies.\n\nThe previous rules imposed a two-pronged test that measured both a chip\u2019s computing performance and its ability to communicate with other chips, an important measure in AI supercomputers where thousands of chips are strung together to chew through huge amounts of data.\n\nNvidia and Intel created special chips for the Chinese market that retained the powerful computing capabilities but limited communications speeds to stay inside the previous rules.\n\nBiren and Moore Thread, whose U.S. suppliers will now face a tough licensing requirement before shipping products to them, are both Chinese startups founded by former Nvidia employees in China and aim to compete with the U.S. AI chip giant.\n\nThe rules released on Tuesday eliminate the communication speed limits and focus on computing performance, which will have the effect of halting sales of Nvidia's A800 and H800 chips for the China market, according to a senior administration official.\n\nU.S. officials on Tuesday added a new measure to restrict chips that exceed a certain level of \"performance density,\" a measure focused on how much computing power can be packed into a given amount of silicon, a senior administration official said.\n\nThe senior administration official said this rule was meant to prevent companies from trying to work around restrictions on full chips by using a technology called \"chiplets,\" where firms could try to join together small pieces called chiplets into a large chip that violates the rules.\n\nReuters reported in July that chiplets have become a core part of China\u2019s technology strategy to advance its chip industry, and analysts have said that Chinese companies could use the technology to evade U.S. restrictions.\n\nLICENSING EXPANDED\n\nThe new measures also expand licensing requirements for exports of advanced chips to more than 40 additional countries that present risks of diversion to China and are subject to U.S. arms embargoes, the officials said.\n\nThat measure appears to build on a letter received by Nvidia in August that it described as restricting shipments of its A100 and H100 chips beyond China to other regions including some countries in the Middle East.\n\nConfirming a Reuters report, chips will be barred from being sent to units of firms located anywhere in the world if their parent companies are headquartered in China, Macau and other arms embargoed countries. The move is part of a bid to keep the chips from being illegally smuggled into China or remotely accessed by Chinese parent companies.\n\nThe Biden administration also hit 21 countries outside China with a licensing requirement for chipmaking tools and broadened the list of equipment barred from going to that country.\n\nOfficials took pains to stress that Chinese officials were warned the rules were coming by National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, confirming a prior Reuters report.\n\n(Reporting by Alexandra Alper, Karen Freifeld, Stephen Nellis, David Shepardson and Max A.

NVDA, The Procter & Gamble Co. PG, NextEra Energy, Inc. NEE, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. GS and Prologis, Inc. PLD.\n\nHere are highlights from Monday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\nTop Analyst Reports for NVIDIA, Procter & Gamble and NextEra Energy\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including NVIDIA Corp., The Procter & Gamble Co. and NextEra Energy, Inc. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nNVIDIA shares have outperformed the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry over the past year (+285.4% vs. +152.9%), a huge outperformance relative the S&P 500 index's +18.1% gain. The Zacks analyst believes that strong growth from artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance computing and accelerated computing is boosting its Compute & Networking revenues. Large language models using GPUs based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures, rising demand for generative AI and surge in Hyperscale demand also aid its growth.\r\n\r\nContinued momentum in the small and medium businesses and frontline worker offerings have driven the top-line growth. However, the company\u2019s near-term prospects are likely to be hurt by weakening demand for chips used in the professional visualization end market.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here >>>)\r\n\r\nProcter & Gamble shares have outperformed the Zacks Consumer Staples \u2013 Soap and Cleaning Materials industry over the past year (+13.6% vs. +10.2%). The Zacks analyst believes that the company is benefiting from a growth in its organic sales, driven by robust pricing and a favorable mix, along with strength across segments. Focus on productivity and cost-saving plans to boost margins have also helped. Rapid adoption of cloud-based solutions, continued deal wins in international markets, and acquisition of Slack have positioned the company as a market leader.\r\n\r\nYet, supply-chain issues, higher SG&A costs, higher transportation costs, geopolitical challenges, currency headwinds and rising inflation have plagued the company. It\u2019s large global presence has also meant that it has been affected by the global macroeconomic goings on.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Procter & Gamble here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of NextEra Energy have underperformed the Zacks Utility \u2013 Electric Power industry over the past year (-26% vs. -8.2%). Per the Zacks analyst, the company\u2019s nature of business has exposed it to complex regulations. Also, risks in operating nuclear units, unfavorable weather conditions and increasing supply costs adversely impact earnings.\r\n\r\nHowever, with numerous projects in its backlog and the merger between Gulf Power and FPL have strengthened NextEra\u2019s position in the area. Also, the company has ample liquidity to pay off its debt obligations while growing exponentially through acquisitions.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on NextEra Energy here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and Prologis, Inc.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy Haven\u2019t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +6.2 average gain per year.

Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nApplied Materials AMAT: Added to the strong buy list in early October, Applied Materials stock will be one to watch as the company is well-positioned to keep its reign as a global leader in supplying equipment for the fabrication of semiconductors.\n\nApplied Materials will be releasing its fiscal fourth quarter results in mid-November and AMAT shares could very well rise leading up to the report. To that point, Applied Materials has surpassed top and bottom-line expectations in its last five quarterly reports, and over the last 60 days fiscal 2023 and FY24 earnings estimates have soared 7% and 13% respectively.  Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nContinuing to focus its strategy and investments on key technologies to accelerate the Internet of Things and AI era, AMAT shares have soared +45% this year and are up over +100% in the last three years to largely outperform the broader indexes. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nQorvo QRVO: With its fiscal second quarter earnings a few weeks away on Wednesday, November 1, Qorvo\u2019s stock got the nod as a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) this week.\n\nQorvo is a multinational semiconductor company that has become one of the leading providers of core technologies and radio frequency (RF) solutions for mobile, infrastructure, and aerospace applications. Leading up to its Q2 report, Qorvo has now surpassed earnings expectations for a remarkable 27 consecutive quarters and surpassed the Zacks Consensus for sales estimates in 30 straight quarterly reports.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nPlus, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) indicates the steak of earnings beats could continue with the Most Accurate Estimate having Q2 EPS at $1.85 per share and 4% above the Zacks Consensus of $1.77 a share. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nUp a modest +2% year to date, Qorvo\u2019s stock may be overlooked at the moment and trades at a reasonable 17.9X forward earnings multiple. Notably, Qorvo\u2019s current fiscal 2024 and FY25 EPS estimates are nicely up over the last 30 days offering further support. Furthermore, annual earnings are now forecasted to dip -12% in FY24 after a tougher-to-compete-against year but rebound and soar 40% in FY25 at $7.29 per share. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe trend of rising earnings estimates is compelling for Applied Materials and Qorvo stock and now may be a great time to buy. This also makes their steaks of stellar quarterly results look more likely to continue and it would be no surprise if Applied Materials and Qorvo stock start to rise in October.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $16.12 billion, up 171.72% from the year-ago period.\n\nFor the annual period, the Zacks Consensus Estimates anticipate earnings of $10.74 per share and a revenue of $54.4 billion, signifying shifts of +221.56% and +101.69%, respectively, from the last year.\n\nInvestors should also pay attention to any latest changes in analyst estimates for Nvidia. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.\n\nOur research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To take advantage of this, we've established the Zacks Rank, an exclusive model that considers these estimated changes and delivers an operational rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, spanning from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), boasts an impressive track record of outperformance, audited externally, with #1 ranked stocks yielding an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.82% higher. Currently, Nvidia is carrying a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nStory continues\n\nIn terms of valuation, Nvidia is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 42.34. This denotes a premium relative to the industry's average Forward P/E of 18.86.\n\nAlso, we should mention that NVDA has a PEG ratio of 3.14. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Semiconductor - General was holding an average PEG ratio of 2.69 at yesterday's closing price.\n\nThe Semiconductor - General industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 85, putting it in the top 34% of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the vigor of our specific industry groups by computing the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks incorporated in the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nDon't forget to use Zacks.com to keep track of all these stock-moving metrics, and others, in the upcoming trading sessions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

With third-quarter earnings reports underway, many are eyeing the tech sector which has seen a jump in earnings. Shana Orczyk Sissel, Banrion Capital Management CEO, joins Yahoo Finance to explain why Nvidia (NVDA) stands out to her and why investors should consider this stock going forward.\n\nSissel explains: \"There's not a lot of competition for what they provide, they have a very strong balance sheet, substantial cash, reserves much higher than their debt, and quite frankly, this AI tailwind is not going to stop just because the economy slows down...

What's your general view of the equity markets, Shana right now?\n\nSHANA ORCZYK SISSEL: I think they're holding up quite well. The economy is showing to be continued, to ne hotter than expected. Labor markets remain inflation remains sticky high. And as long as that continues, that's going to be a headwind to equities. Because we're always going to have the Fed as a concern.\n\nNow, there have been many Fed members, and governors who have indicated that the Fed is done raising rates. And they really want to see how this kind of plays out. Which, I think, is smart. But we don't want to get into a 1970s scenario where there's a lot of stop and go.\n\nThe question really remains, is the Fed-- when they say 2%-- do they mean, 2% or do they mean sub 3? Because the long-term average over the last 40 years for inflation is about 2.8%. So I think the realistic target should, be if they can get inflation under 3%, that would be a win. And that is what I would consider as the best scenario for a soft landing.\n\nStory continues\n\nThey're not really communicating well, if that's what they're looking for, and I think that's really a risk. Because inflation does appear to be sticky high, and there's really nothing in the growth numbers that are indicating that growth is slowing down, which is what we would really need to get supply and demand back into equilibrium. Until that happens, I'm concerned that there is downside in this market.\n\n- So let's get to some of your other investment ideas, right. You mentioned some of the liquid alts and the ETFs that you're playing them through. I was struck by your choice of NVIDIA also in your stock picks because if we're looking at a market that is on a little bit of delicate footing right now. And as we know, NVIDIA has been almost a rocket ship on this AI thesis. Doesn't it get hit along with other growth stocks, if things start to go south a little bit?\n\n- That's certainly a risk. And I'm not saying I'm a huge fan of technology here, NVIDIA is kind of a special case, in my opinion, I follow this stock my entire career, so 20 plus years. And I just think that there's not a lot of competition for what they provide.\n\nThey have very strong balance sheet. They have substantial cash, reserves are much higher than their debt. And quite frankly, this AI tailwind is not going to stop just because the economy slows down. It might be somewhat slower, but NVIDIA will continue to benefit as they are the largest provider of chips in that space. They lead that space. They really don't have any competition there.\n\nAnd so M that reason, I think Nvidia can actually hold up quite well. If it did for any reason, start to turn down, I would be a buyer of the stock. I'd continue to hold the stock. And I think that it is a stock that actually will of the technology names ride through this period quite well.\n\nThe AI trend is not going away. And Nvidia is the largest benefactory of that particular trend. So for me, it's still a stock that I hold. It's a stock I would buy more of on weakness. I just think the long-term trend is very favorable for there, them in particular. And that is not saying that I'm a huge fan of technology as a sector, but that stock in particular, I think, has a lot of tailwinds. And will continue to do well regardless of economic conditions.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/video/why-nvidia-special-case-despite-200124760.html", "symbols": ["NVD.F", "NVD.XETRA", "NVDA.MX", "NVDA.US", "NVDC34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.982, "neg": 0.035, "neu": 0.895, "pos": 0.07}}, {"date": "2023-10-16T19:20:00+00:00", "title": "Cathie Wood says one prominent tech stock is a stronger long-term bet than Nvidia", "content": "Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood said she does not regret dumping the bulk of her firm's investment in chipmaker Nvidia.\n\nContinue reading", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/m/e6dccdab-82cc-368e-a8dd-12aa9b81961b/cathie-wood-says-one.html", "symbols": ["NVD.F", "NVD.XETRA", "NVDA.MX", "NVDA.US", "NVDC34.SA", "TL0.F", "TL0.XETRA", "TSLA.MX", "TSLA.US", "TSLA34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.228, "neg": 0, "neu": 0.873, "pos": 0.127}}, {"date": "2023-10-16T19:15:00+00:00", "title": "Top Analyst Reports for NVIDIA, Procter &amp; Gamble &amp; NextEra Energy", "content": "Wednesday, October 16, 2023\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team.

If you want to skip our analysis of the technology industry, then take a look at 5 Technology Stocks To Buy That Are Too Cheap To Ignore.\n\nTechnology has proven to be the most remarkable industry of our age since it has virtually (no pun intended) transformed every aspect of modern day living. We've written this article using technology, you're using technology to read this article, and the stocks that everyone is trading are now available through digital mediums that would have been unimaginable just a couple of decades back.\n\nBefore we get to the financial bit about the technology industry it's important to understand what the term actually means. Due to its near ubiquity in modern day living, technology is simply defined as the use of knowledge involving technical processes to achieve an objective. In a broad definition, this adaptability of technical processes to different use cases naturally affects a lot of different walks of life. At its very heart, technology can also be defined as using an electronic system to speed up data collection, analysis, and computation - three things that can power anything from the iPhone to a data center, an airplane, or a car.\n\nSince computing sits at the heart of technology, one of the most important segments of the technology industry is the semiconductor sector. A semiconductor is a small piece of silicon with circuits made of different materials printed on top of it. The smaller these circuits get, the greater the semiconductor's performance since small feature sizes lead to greater power savings and electrical conductivity. This criticality of semiconductors, also called chips, to the global technological landscape has also made semiconductors one of the most controversial and risky industries these days.\n\nThis is because the high end technologies involved in making chips coupled with the billions of dollars in capital expenditure needed to set up a new chip manufacturing plant mean that the barriers of entry to this industry are among the highest in the world and stand in parallel to other high tech sectors such as rocket and aircraft manufacturing. Consequently, only three companies in the world, namely the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), and Samsung Electronics can make the latest chips, with others limited to older models. Out of these, only TSMC and Samsung sell their chips to third party customers such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) since Intel only makes and sells its own chips.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy is this important? Well, TSMC is the biggest contract chip manufacturer in the world in terms of volume and all of its advanced chip manufacturing facilities are located in the disputed island of Taiwan. Taiwan and China share a common history, and Beijing considers it an integral part of its territory even though Taiwan has its own passport and holds its own elections. Therefore, the island's status is a cause of significant friction between China and the Western rules based order led by the United States, and one of the biggest worries in the chip sector is that a potential conflict in China can disrupt the global semiconductor supply chain to lead to unimaginable consequences.\n\nThe potential repercussions of such a conflict are so significant that they even made the well known Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway to change his mind. Mr. Buffett's investment firm made headlines at the end of last year as its filings with the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) revealed that it had bought a whopping 60 million TSMC shares for a $4.1 billion investment for its third quarter of 2022 investments. Since Mr. Buffett takes his sweet time before investing, the decision suggested that TSMC could do nothing wrong. However, in the very next quarter, Berkshire Hathaway reduced its stake by an equally stunning $3.5 billion and disposed off of the shares entirely in the succeeding quarter. The $3.5 billion reduction made waves in the industry as speculation started to become rife about the reason behind the Oracle of Omaha's sudden shift of mood.\n\nMr. Buffett explained his decision soon, sharing that he believes that TSMC is a solid company but the firm's geopolitical risks simply proved too much to ignore. According to CNN which quotes several of his statements:\n\n\u201cI feel better about the capital that we\u2019ve got deployed in Japan than in Taiwan,\u201d the Berkshire Hathaway chairman added. \u201cI wish it weren\u2019t sold, but I think that\u2019s a reality.\u201d\n\nDespite the share sale, Buffett lauded TSMC as \u201cone of the best-managed companies and [most] important companies in the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no one in the chip industry that\u2019s in their league, at least in my view,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMarvelous people and marvelous competitive position and everything, [but] I\u2019d rather find it in the United States.\u201d\n\nBuffett said his reassessment of the company was in \u201clight of certain things that were going on.\u201d He had previously pointed to geopolitical tensions as a concern.\n\nBefore we get to our latest pick of the cheapest technology stocks, it's also important to briefly consider the current investment climate for these stocks. The technology sector is a growth industry that depends on robust purchasing power for both businesses and consumers as well as easy access to capital due to expensive products and services. These days, technology stocks are under pressure as high rates and troubling economic data have dampened investors' risk appetites. Therefore, the major catalysts for the sector as a whole are announcements regarding interest rate cuts as well as economic growth since a slowing economy sees capital fly to safety in sectors such as consumer defensive.\n\nSo, time to look at some great cheap technology stocks, and some notable picks are QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM), Applied Materials, Inc.

For tech workers there, it\u2019s already had a devastating effect.\n\nSeveral years ago, Nvidia bought an Israeli-American networking company called Mellanox for $7 billion, using it as the basis for a center that employs 3,000 people. As reported Friday by CTech, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang wrote to Israeli employees to offer his condolences to Mellanox founder Eyal Waldman, whose daughter Danielle was among those slaughtered by Hamas militants at the Supernova music festival\u2014her partner, former Nvidia employee Noam Shai, also was killed.\n\nNvidia employee Avinatan Or and his girlfriend Noa Argamani are hostages. And hundreds of Nvidia\u2019s workers have been called up to return to military duty. \u201cOur thoughts are constantly with you, and we hope for your safe return,\u201d Huang wrote. \u201cNvidians worldwide will rise to cover for our colleagues in Israel and pick up and offload whatever work you need. We are here for you.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, at least a tenth of workers at the workplace collaboration platform Spike have taken up co-founder Dvir Ben-Aroya\u2019s offer of company support for those who want to temporarily move away from Israel with their families, according to CNBC\u2014the article also notes several examples of companies where international colleagues are eagerly filling in for Israeli employees who have been called up, or who just need time off to cope with the national trauma.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to concentrate on work when you\u2019re dealing with all these personal matters and on securing yourself and the country,\u201d venture capitalist Yaniv Sadka told CNBC, also noting that many of the tech workers are being pulled into the Israeli Defense Forces\u2019 intelligence units.\n\nBut while Israel\u2019s tech focus is well known\u2014the sector accounts for a tenth of the Israeli workforce\u2014Palestine also has aspirations as a tech hub, with some Silicon Valley companies eagerly hiring talent there. TechCrunch\u2019s Mike Butcher provides a grim account of what\u2019s been happening in Gaza even before Israel\u2019s planned ground offensive.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe building that housed the Gaza Sky Geeks accelerator\u2014from which 5,000 developers graduated last year\u2014has been blown out by Israeli shelling. \u201cThe offices are destroyed, the fiber lines are destroyed.

But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.\n\nBy their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.\n\nHowever, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank.\n\nResearch shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).\n\nHere are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence a great growth pick right now.\n\nEarnings Growth\n\nEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\n\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Nvidia is 31.2%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 221.5% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of -9.4%.\n\nImpressive Asset Utilization Ratio\n\nAsset utilization ratio -- also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio -- is often overlooked by investors, but it is an important indicator in growth investing. This metric shows how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nRight now, Nvidia has an S/TA ratio of 0.74, which means that the company gets $0.74 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.69, it can be said that the company is more efficient.\n\nIn addition to efficiency in generating sales, sales growth plays an important role. And Nvidia is well positioned from a sales growth perspective too. The company's sales are expected to grow 101.7% this year versus the industry average of -3.9%.\n\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nThere have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Nvidia. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.8% over the past month.\n\nBottom Line\n\nNvidia has not only earned a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #1 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nThis combination positions Nvidia well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Logitech and Sony are collaborating to launch this kit to offer customizable options to enable gamers with disabilities to enjoy their gaming experiences.\n\nThe kit includes a variety of high-performance and durable buttons and triggers that are specifically designed to meet the accessibility needs of gamers. It also features gaming-grade mechanical button switches, adjustable trigger controls, custom PS5 controller labels, velcro ties and a host of other options for optimal setup and customization.\n\nThe Logitech G Adaptive Gaming Kit for the Access controller will be accessible for purchase through both the Logitech G website and selected retail outlets. The users must have a PS5 Console and Access controller to utilize the Adaptive Gaming Kit.\n\nLogitech International S.A. Price and Consensus Logitech International S.A. Price and Consensus\n\nLogitech International S.A. price-consensus-chart | Logitech International S.A. Quote\n\nThe launch of the Adaptive Gaming Kit is part of a series of product launches in the second quarter of 2024, which also included the Logitech G PRO X TKL LIGHTSPEED Gaming Keyboard, Logitech G PRO X SUPERLIGHT 2 Gaming Mouse, Wave Keys Keyboards and the latest generation of Yeti microphones.\n\nShares of Logitech have outperformed the Zacks Computer \u2013 Peripheral Equipment industry in the year-to-date (YTD) period. Shares of LOGI have gained 14.2% YTD compared with the Computer \u2013 Peripheral Equipment industry\u2019s rise of 2.1%.\n\nLogitech Focuses on Expanding Product Portfolio\n\nLogitech intends to tap the high-potential market for accessories by pursuing innovation and expanding its product lines. The company has manufactured innovative offerings like the fastest performing mouse and keyboard switches, wireless mouse with longest battery and multi-device keyboards, among others.\n\nLOGI is also expanding its product portfolio through acquisitions. In July 2023, it acquired Finland\u2019s Loupedeck. The acquisition is expected to enhance Logitech\u2019s ability to provide customizable and contextual control experiences for the company\u2019s full portfolio of devices, including the Logitech Software Roadmap solution.\n\nStory continues\n\nLoupedeck offers deep native integrations with industry-leading creative software for photo editing, retouching, video editing, color grading design and streaming. Its custom consoles combine analog control with digital precision to offer power and flexibility to all creators. With this buyout, Logitech will leverage Loupedeck\u2019s strong and growing developer community that will unveil advanced innovation, empowering streamers, creators and gamers.\n\nLOGI\u2019s sustained focus on introducing new and innovative products might boost sales and somewhat offset the negative impact of the weakened demand for PC peripheral products. In 2020 and 2021, Logitech benefited from the elevated demand for its Video Collaboration, PC Webcams, Keyboards & Combos and Pointing Device tools, mainly driven by the heightening of work-from-home and learn-from-home trends.\n\nHowever, the weakening global economy amid ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical issues enhanced global recessionary concerns, thereby prompting enterprises to postpone their large IT spending plan. Furthermore, continued industry layoffs due to growing recessionary concerns are hampering the demand for PC peripheral products by organizations.\n\nThe aforementioned factors are hurting Logitech\u2019s financial performance. In first-quarter fiscal 2024, the company\u2019s revenues and non-GAAP earnings per share declined 16% and 12%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis.\n\nZacks Rank and Other Stocks to Consider\n\nCurrently, Logitech carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nSome other top-ranked stocks from the broader technology sector are NVIDIA NVDA, Synopsys SNPS and Palo Alto Networks PANW, each sporting a Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for NVIDIA's third-quarter fiscal 2024 earnings has been revised upward by 2 cents to $3.34 per share in the past 30 days. For fiscal 2024, earnings estimates have increased by 7 cents to $10.74 per share in the past 30 days.\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the preceding four quarters while missing on one occasion, the average surprise being 9.8%. Shares of NVDA have rallied 211% year to date.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Synopsys\u2019 fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings has been revised upward by 12 cents to $3.04 per share in the past 60 days.

He pointed out that ARKK and other Cathie Wood funds dropped the ball on AI stocks, particularly after her funds divested all Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock well before the company\u2019s current runup.\n\nHowever, Cathie Wood disagreed with the assessment. Specifically, Cathie Wood said, \u201cif you read our research going back to 2014, we\u2019ve been very focused on the revolution called artificial intelligence.\u201d She then reminded the interviewer that her funds held Nvidia when the stock traded for just $5 before selling in January 2022 in the mid-$100 range. Furthermore, Cathie Wood told the interviewer the real reason the Nvidia play doesn\u2019t matter for Ark Invest: her firm is doing \u201creal original research as opposed to checking a box, artificial intelligence, Nvidia.\u201d\n\nCathie Wood says her firm is focusing on more than simply leveraging AI as a buzzword. Instead, Ark Invest is focusing on firms with domain expertise and uniquely applied AI that stands to dominate those respective domains.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nUltimately, Cathie Wood says these three AI stocks are how her funds offer \u201cdiversification in the disruptive innovation space.\u201d But you don\u2019t need to be an ARKK bag holder to copy her strategy with Cathie Wood stocks.\n\nZoom (ZM)\n\nSource: Girts Ragelis / Shutterstock.com\n\nZoom (NASDAQ:ZM) is a somewhat surprising AI stock play for Cathie Wood. In the interview, she pointed to the then-upcoming Zoomtopia event for an idea of how the remote conferencing tool leveraged AI. That event happened at the beginning of the month. Investors can now understand what Cathie Wood sees in this AI stock.\n\nDuring Zoomtopia, the company unveiled a new suite of AI-driven products. Zoom Docs, for example, is a centralized AI workspace that could emerge as a competitor to Alphabet\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) ever-popular Google Docs platform.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf Cathie Wood\u2019s Zoom endorsement isn\u2019t enough, maybe Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) Charlie Munger\u2019s enthusiastic support will sway value and growth investors alike. Munger delivered Zoomtopia\u2019s closing keynote speech. In the speech, Munger jokingly discussed how he and Warren Buffett used to rely on telegraph and telephone to discuss and execute deals. But today, he\u2019s bullish on Zoom. He told listeners, \u201cI use Zoom a lot to do business out of my house. It\u2019s very convenient for me because travel is difficult.\u201d But Munger and his team don\u2019t just use Zoom for business. He also said. \u201cWe have family Zooms, too, and get the whole family together. It\u2019s easy to punch a few buttons overall to get connected.\u201d\n\nZoom has been a longtime staple of the emerging remote work world. Its AI offerings could mean big things for the stock. Cathie Wood is headed in the right direction with Zoom, and Charlie Munger\u2019s endorsement further cements its long-term potential on the list of AI stocks.\n\nExact Sciences (EXAS)\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock\n\nExact Sciences (NASDAQ:EXAS) is a biotech stock leveraging AI. The company also comprises the largest holding in Cathie Wood\u2019s ARK Genomic Revolution ETF (BATS:ARKG) at 10.38% total weight. The company recently posted its sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit sales growth, proving its market potential. Likewise, analyst sentiment for the stock is overwhelmingly positive, with its current price nearly 50% below consensus fair value estimates.\n\nExact Sciences\u2019 AI potential comes, in part, from an ongoing partnership with OncXerna Therapeutics, a private biotech firm. The two leverage OncXerna\u2019s AI-powered platform to act as an early cancer diagnostic tool. The platform uses machine learning to align patient tumor types with biologically-appropriate treatment tailored to the patient. The platform\u2019s potential is massive and serves as proof that AI has a bright future in healthcare.\n\nExact Sciences also partnered with VieCure, another AI-driven cancer diagnostic platform. Like its other goals, this AI-powered partnership seeks to \u201cimprove clinical workflow and make it easier for community oncologists to order the right tests and generate patient-specific treatment plans.\u201d\n\nUiPath (PATH)\n\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock.com\n\nUiPath (NYSE:PATH) is Cathie Wood\u2019s top AI stock. In the interview, she said that the robotics automation firm \u201cis helping companies automate the most mundane administrative tasks in their companies\u201d using AI. UiPath\u2019s offerings might seem mundane at first. After all, automation systems in the workplace have been longtime staples of the digital office age. But a look at the many case studies the firm hosts points to the underlying reason behind Cathie Wood\u2019s bull thesis. UiPath is tailorable across innumerable industries leveraging company or sector-specific data sets. UiPath is also integratable with many leading SaaS products, including Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), Amazon\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMZN) web service segment and even OpenAI.\n\nConsidering how the economy treats tech stocks today, the company\u2019s financial strength and growth are also noteworthy. UiPath posted a 19% overall year-over-year revenue growth in its most recent report. UiPath also grew recurring revenue by 25%, indicating a happy client base sticking with the company\u2019s automation solutions. PATH shares are up about 33% this year, but the stock is still priced to buy. Investors interested in replicating the Cathie Wood strategy should make UiPath a AI stocks portfolio fixture.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

In fact, according to Grand View Research, the AI market is projected to expand at a compound annual rate of 37.3% through the end of this decade, from $196.6 billion in 2023 to $1.8 trillion in 2030.\n\nContinue reading", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/m/33dd1981-7426-3197-b1e9-3e87bf305ee4/want-to-get-richer%3F-3-best.html", "symbols": ["45C.F", "CRWD.US", "DDOG.US", "NVD.F", "NVD.XETRA", "NVDA.MX", "NVDA.US", "NVDC34.SA"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.949, "neg": 0, "neu": 0.826, "pos": 0.174}}, {"date": "2023-10-16T13:56:00+00:00", "title": "Infosys (INFY) Extends Digital Services JV With Temasek", "content": "InfosysLimited INFY recently announced that it is set to extend its joint venture (JV) with Temasek. Initially, the two companies collaborated in 2018, with Infosys acquiring a 60% stake in the JV while Temasek held 40%.\n\nThe Infosys-Temasek JV, named Infosys Compaz, was established with INFY's vision to enter into the Southeast Asian market, with the former benefiting from an increase in workforce capacity and the latter gaining from improvements in its IT services.\n\nIn the past five years, the JV has undergone numerous partnerships with large corporations in Southeast Asia. These partnerships have worked on multiple digital transformation journeys in the fields of cloud, cybersecurity, digital, automation, data and analytics and artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nInfosys Limited Price and Consensus American Noble Gas Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nInfosys Limited price-consensus-chart | Infosys Limited Quote\n\nInfosys Compaz is leveraging the capabilities of Infosys Cobalt and Topaz to enable its customers to enhance the cloud and AI capabilities. The recent extension reinforces the company's 2018 commitment to invest in advanced technologies, capabilities and workforce development for high-quality professional services.\n\nShares of Infosys have underperformed the Zacks Computer and Technology sector in the year-to-date (YTD) period. Shares of INFY have declined 6.2% YTD against the Computer and Technology sector\u2019s rise of 36.1%.\n\nINFY's digital transformation offerings are receiving a positive response from its clients. Furthermore, as clients focus on vendor consolidation, the company is benefiting from stronger deals. In the second quarter of 2024, Infosys signed 21 large deals across America and Europe.\n\nHowever, the company is facing a mixed bag of challenges. Its business is being affected by near-term uncertainties stemming from inflation and high interest rates. Slow decision-making processes, along with softness in digital transformation programs and discretionary spending in the current uncertain macroeconomic environment, are hurting the company\u2019s volumes.\n\nStory continues\n\nNevertheless, during the recently reported financial results for second-quarter fiscal 2024, Infosys\u2019 revenues grew 2.5% year over year and 2.3% sequentially. Its AI capabilities, like those of Infosys Topaz, have shown promising results and have increased its market share, thus more than offsetting the negative impact of the aforementioned factors.\n\nZacks Rank & Stocks to Consider\n\nInfosys currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nSome better-ranked stocks from the broader technology sector are NVIDIA NVDA, Synopsys SNPS and Palo Alto Networks PANW, each sporting a Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for NVIDIA's third-quarter fiscal 2024 earnings has been revised upward by 2 cents to $3.34 per share in the past 30 days. For fiscal 2024, earnings estimates have increased by 7 cents to $10.74 per share in the past 30 days.\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the preceding four quarters while missing on one occasion, the average surprise being 9.8%. Shares of NVDA have rallied 211% year to date.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Synopsys\u2019 fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings has been revised upward by 12 cents to $3.04 per share in the past 60 days.

Year-to-date, the S&P 500 Index ETF is up 13.65%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 ETF is up a robust 40%. Despite the massive turnaround and the clear character change in equities, many of Wall Street\u2019s most esteemed analysts were neutral on the stocks, or worse, bearish. Regardless of whether you have cashed in on the bull market or missed it, studying and learning from stock market history is crucial for several reasons, including:\n\nPatterns & Trends: Stock market history reveals patterns and trends that repeat over time. Investors can identify and learn from repeatable patterns to make more informed decisions in the future.\n\nMarket Psychology: Historical events show how market psychology can drive prices.\n\nInformed Decision Making: Informed investors equip themselves with historical data that can aid them in reducing impulsive and emotional trading, which often leads to stock market losses.\n\nBelow are 5 of the most critical lessons from the 2023 equity market:\n\nBear Markets Bottom on Bad News\n\nThough it may seem counterintuitive to amateur investors, corrective markets tend to bottom when there is panic selling on poor news. That\u2019s precisely what occurred in 2023. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) reading shot to 40-year highs on the day equities bottomed. Equity markets are similar to poor poker players in that they often give a \u201ctell\u201d or a subtle clue that things have changed. The day CPI hit 40-year highs, stocks opened the session deep in the red but closed the session higher by more than 2%. The best bottoms occur when \u201cbad\u201d news becomes good news.\n\nStory continues\n\nStocks Discount Future Earnings\n\nAs 2022 concluded, many Wall Street gurus were discussing the potential for a recession (a significant decline in economic activity across the economy, characterized by a decrease in GDP, employment, and overall trade, usually lasting for a prolonged period). They failed to understand that the bullish price action in stocks was a sign that earnings were troughing. Stocks almost always turn before earnings.\n\nThe AI Revolution Is For Real\n\nWhenever a new technology emerges, investors can easily get lost in the hype and have unrealistic expectations. 2023 will be known as the year OpenAI and Microsoft\u2019s ChatGPT catapulted AI into the mainstream. But how do investors separate revolutionary technology from hype? Earnings. Nvidia, which makes the top chips used in AI technology, will grow revenues to more than $50 billion in 2024. For context, NVDA was already the far-and-away chip leader in 2020, when the company earned just $10 billion in revenue.\n\nBull Markets Climb a Wall of Worry\n\nThe 2023 bull market is proof that bull markets climb a \u201cwall of worry\u201d. Equities have rallied in the face of recession fears, rising interest rates, stubborn inflation, and geopolitical upheaval.\n\nExtreme Sentiment Readings Mark Turning Points\n\n\u201cIf everyone is thinking the same, someone isn\u2019t thinking.\u201dThe CNN Fear & Greed Index flashed \u201cextreme fear\u201d readings three times in the past year: October 2022, March 2023, and early October. Each time fear hit a fever pitch, equities established a significant bottom.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn 2023, the stock market is witnessing a significant turnaround and is defying Wall Street analysts\u2019 bearish expectations. The lessons that investors can learn underscore the value of historical analysis and understanding market psychology for successful stock market navigation.\n\nWhy Haven\u2019t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +6.2 average gain per year.

It hasn\u2019t been due to VR in any direct way. Nor has it been due to growth. In fact, Apple continued to contract in its fiscal year Q3 overall.\n\niPhone sales are down which is a leading indicator that consumers simply don\u2019t have as much money for expensive tech as they did in the recent past. That should dictate that AAPL shares fall in price. They haven\u2019t. Apple is simply too big and important and has too many catalysts in its favor. Investors are giving Apple credit for all of it. That includes a burgeoning market in India where Apple is investing heavily. It also includes an increasing ability to derive more revenue from services. This makes it one of those VR stocks to consider.\n\nEven when Apple falters investors give it the benefit of the doubt. iPhone sales have inspired a cult-like following and that matters. VR matters too. Apple will release the Apple Vision Pro in the first quarter of 2024. It will cost $3,499. While that\u2019s a lofty price, it isn\u2019t expected to move the revenue needle much given sales projections. Instead, it gives Apple greater long-term potential in an exciting new sector.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta Platforms (META)\n\nSource: Blue Planet Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nI alluded to Meta Platforms\u2019 (NASDAQ:META) rebrand in the introduction to this article. The stock gave a lot of pundits a lot to like when it ditched its Facebook moniker in late October of 2021.\n\nThe rebrand implied that growth initiatives were here to stay. Otherwise, what would give Facebook the confidence to abandon its brand for the Metaverse? You don\u2019t give up the Facebook name without a firm belief that rates will remain low and growth high. The Meta Platforms rebrand was a screaming indication of that belief. It was also wrong. A few weeks later inflation data caught up to the markets. The realization that quantitative tightening was approaching swept over markets in mid-November. The newly renamed Meta Platforms tanked, Zuckerberg looked like a fool, and the metaverse fervor dissipated.\n\nAll things come and go. Meta Platforms has rebounded in 2023. The rebound is primarily attributable to its growing top-line and steady bottom-line performance. Reality Labs, its virtual reality segment, is only losing more and more money. It has sold a lot of headsets but struggles to retain customers. As VR comes back into focus that\u2019s where Meta can make gains.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM)\n\nSource: Akshdeep Kaur Raked / Shutterstock.com\n\nLet me start by discussing Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) as a stock that is attractive in general. The company is an important chipmaker in the tech space and has forged important relationships with the world\u2019s biggest companies. Apple among them. It\u2019s going to continue to supply Apple with RF chips through 2026. That\u2019s a big win because it provides a stable runway for the firm for several years.\n\nFurther, Qualcomm is simply stable overall. Not many other tech firms of its size provide a dividend that yields 2.9%. QCOM shares do and that dividend has grown since 2003. Investors should get the general sense that Qualcomm is stable. This stability may boost its attractiveness as one of those VR stocks.\n\nIn regard to virtual reality, Qualcomm is also notable. The company is developing VR glasses that will compete with the Apple Vision Pro in the near future. They\u2019re not nearly as large and look like industrial safety glasses, not a massive headset. Overall, QCOM is a safe bet for tech exposure that includes virtual reality.\n\nUnity Software (U)\n\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock.com\n\nA peak into Unity Software\u2019s (NYSE:U) investor relations provides a lot of insight into the direction of the stock. It is heavily entrenched in the reemerging virtual reality opportunity.\n\nThe company released a beta program to allow developers to begin creating apps and games for the Apple Vision Pro in July. Unity developers are now creating VR experiences using VisionOS, Apple\u2019s operating system for its headset.\n\nUnity has also set up a new division that will grant the broader virtual effects industry access to its Weta FX tools. Those tools were used in movies including Lord of the Rings and Avatar. The new division is making both 2D and 3D tools available to developers. That further confirms that Unity Software has established itself in the VR space.\n\nUnity Software continues to grow steadily and reached EBITDA profitability in Q4 of 2022. Net losses narrowed in H1 though still substantial. Those losses are likely to be a drag on U shares in this higher longer rate environment. That said, the overall picture is positive based on VR-related news and fundamental improvements.\n\nMatterport (MTTR)\n\nMatterport (NASDAQ:MTTR) stock is again becoming a relevant growth story in the virtual reality/digital twin space. The company sells 3D cameras and software that are used to create virtual models of buildings. It\u2019s easy to imagine the overall utility and opportunity the company provides for investors as more and more spaces get mapped digitally.\n\nThat is actually precisely what\u2019s occurring at the moment. Matterport is growing steadily and rapidly. Q2 revenues grew by 39% to $39.6 million. That\u2019s great but not particularly compelling to investors because of the rates. The issue that holds MTTR stock lower at the moment is the fact that losses increased from $56.5 million to $64.6 million in Q2. The positive there is that losses grew at a lower rate than that by which revenues increased. In other words, Matterport could reasonably be expected to see losses begin to narrow in the future.\n\nIt has no problem selling its cameras and software. It has a cyclicality problem that will change in a year or so. It\u2019s definitely one o those VR stocks to consider.\n\nAdobe (ADBE)\n\nSource: Tattoboo / Shutterstock\n\nAdobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is another stock that\u2019s heavily invested in virtual reality. It\u2019s perhaps best known for tools like Acrobat but it is also a major visualization firm as evidenced by Photoshop\u2019s dominance. Adobe\u2019s presence in 2D digital visualization should make it unsurprising that the company is moving into 3D digital experiences as well.\n\nAbode Substance 3D is the company\u2019s toolset for 3D and AR software. It supports 3D modeling of objects just as all other 3D visualization software does. It\u2019s difficult to assert that Adobe is the clear winner in that regard as it remains early. However, it\u2019s incontrovertible that Adobe just delivered record revenue in Q3. It also reported record digital media annual recurring revenue for within digital media. Adobe is capitalizing on the AI boom and the VR opportunity is yet to come.\n\nABDE shares are strong even though the company is part of a second tier of tech stocks that fall behind the likes of the \u2018Magnificent 7\u2019.\n\nNvidia (NVDA)\n\nSource: Evolf / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), unsurprisingly, is also very useful for virtual reality. That, among many other strengths, continues to make the stock a strong overall pick.\n\nThere\u2019s no definitive \u2018best\u2019 chip for VR. Everything depends upon end-use and budget. This guide lays out those options very thoroughly. Nvidia comes up again and again and that\u2019s yet another reason that investors have to believe in its long-term value.\n\nIt\u2019s tough to talk about Nvidia without mentioning AI. Its dominance in that sphere has propelled shares massively higher this year as generative AI has been commercialized. AI investment has cooled as the market is more fearful at the moment. However, Nvidia has done its part: It delivered revenues that far exceeded already sky-high estimates in Q2. Buy it for virtual reality because it\u2019s strong there or buy it for AI because it dominates there. Nvidia simply remains a buy because it\u2019s too difficult to argue against its overall strengths in this new era as AI emerges. Whichever way you cut it, this means it one of those VR stocks to pay attention to.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.
