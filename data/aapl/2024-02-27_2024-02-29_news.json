And with no big, splashy products to look forward to, Wall Street is pinning its hopes for the tech giant\u2019s immediate future on, what else, generative AI.\n\nIn his initial report on Apple\u2019s decision to shutter its automotive efforts, Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman said a number of the 2,000 employees previously assigned to the project will move over to the company\u2019s artificial intelligence division where they\u2019ll work on getting Apple\u2019s generative AI chops up to snuff.\n\nThe news helped briefly buoy shares of Apple Tuesday, sending them to an intraday high of $183.92 before closing out the day at $182.63. Shares of Apple were trading at $180.33 midday Thursday.\n\nApple is the second-wealthiest company in the world by market valuation, behind only Microsoft (MSFT), with a market cap of $2.77 trillion. But the iPhone maker is also contending with a choppy smartphone market that has investors wondering where the company\u2019s next leg of growth will come from.\n\nAnd, short of a fully redesigned iPhone, it looks like generative AI is the only new product that could help goose device and services sales. Apple CEO Tim Cook gestures at Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference at the company's headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., June 5, 2023. (Loren Elliott/REUTERS) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nBut Apple, as is its M.O., has been tight-lipped about its generative AI efforts. CEO Tim Cook hasn\u2019t offered any insights into the kind of capabilities the company is exploring via the technology or if they\u2019ll come to market this year.\n\nDuring Apple\u2019s latest earnings call, Cook said he is excited to show off what the company has been working on and that it will debut its efforts this year. He later said generative AI is a huge opportunity for Apple. During the company\u2019s annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday, the CEO said Apple is investing significantly in AI and will break new ground in generative AI later this year.\n\nThat means we\u2019ll likely learn more about Apple\u2019s generative AI plans during its upcoming WWDC conference, which typically takes place in June. And the pressure is on for those announcements to be more than a few new photo editing tools or kitschy features that let you change the tone of your text messages to sound like Shakespeare.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cWe believe Apple is set to launch a host of new Gen AI software features at WWDC in early June, which we see as a key event helping to catalyze an iPhone upgrade cycle,\u201d Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring wrote in a note following the Bloomberg report.\n\nIn his own note, Wedbush\u2019s Dan Ives said he believes \u201cApple will incorporate generative AI into iPhone 16 and this will mark the start of a new frontier of growth for the golden installed base of Cupertino.\u201d What\u2019s more, he said the addition of the former vehicle engineers and developers could accelerate Apple\u2019s AI initiatives over the next 12 to 18 months. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nThe generative AI craze has driven shares of Apple\u2019s rivals ever higher, including Microsoft, which eclipsed Apple as the most valuable publicly traded company thanks to its investments in ChatGPT developer OpenAI. Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and others have similarly jumped on the generative AI bandwagon with their own announcements and product launches.\n\nBut diving into the deep end of generative AI is a double-edged sword. Sure, those companies get the fanfare and excitement that comes along with a new generative AI-powered service, but when those services falter, tech firms are left holding the bag. Just look at Google, which pulled its Gemini AI image generator after the software produced images of ethnically diverse Nazis.\n\nThat adds additional pressure to Apple to not only hit the market with a bang but also ensure what it rolls out is as bulletproof as possible. We\u2019ll find out if the company has the goods when WWDC kicks off in June.\n\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance. He's been covering the tech industry since 2011.

The cycle has primarily been positive, underpinned by the Technology sector\u2019s strong performance that has uplifted the overall earnings picture.\n\nAnd throughout the period, there have been several companies delivering results that reflected quarterly records, including Apple AAPL, NVIDIA NVDA, and Celsius Holdings CELH.\n\nBelow is a chart illustrating the performance of each over the last year, with the S&P 500 blended in as a benchmark. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at each.\n\nApple\n\nMarket-favorite Apple posted quarterly sales of nearly $120 billion and record EPS of $2.18, exceeding our consensus expectations by 1.7% and 4.3%, respectively. Sales grew 2% year-over-year, whereas EPS showed 16% growth.\n\nStill, EPS wasn\u2019t the only quarterly record, as Services revenue of $23.1 billion reached its highest mark yet and grew 11% from the same period last year. Services revenue has become a nice growth driver for Apple overall, helping to decrease its reliance on the iPhone.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the reported figure modestly fell short of the Zacks Consensus estimate, snapping a streak of recent surprises. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nShares couldn\u2019t hold positivity post-earnings, with AAPL shares down nearly 7% YTD and underperforming the S&P 500 by a notable margin. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNVIDIA\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s quarterly release stole the market spotlight, undoubtedly the most highly-awaited release of the period following an unbelievable growth story stemming from the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThe company generated record Q4 revenue of $22.1 billion and posted EPS of $5.16, reflecting remarkable growth rates of 409% and 485%, respectively. Both items exceeded our consensus earnings and revenue expectations, representing beats of 13% and 8%, respectively.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company\u2019s top line trajectory is visibly bullish, as shown below. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nUnsurprisingly, Data Center results were the real highlight of the release, which include sales of its AI chips. NVIDIA\u2019s Data Center raked in a record $18.4 billion throughout the period, up an astonishing 410% on a year-over-year stack and reflecting the unrelenting demand the company has been enjoying.\n\nThe reported figure blew away our consensus estimate by nearly $1.5 billion, continuing a recent streak of Data Center positivity. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAnalysts have been revising their earnings expectations higher for the company over the last year, landing the stock into the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nCelsius Holdings\n\nCelsius just delivered its latest batch of quarterly results, with Q4 revenue of $347 million 95% higher than the year-ago period and reflecting a record. Quarterly earnings totaled $0.17 per share, above our consensus estimate and well above the $0.01 per share mark in the same period last year.\n\nShares have soared following the print, up a sizable 170% just over the last year. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nResults were driven by strength across both International and North American markets, with sales of each growing 97% and 68% year-over-year, respectively. The company continues to win over new customers, also seeing an uptick in consumption occasions.\n\nBottom Line\n\nEarnings season is slowly grinding to a halt, as the majority of notable companies have already delivered quarterly results. The Q4 cycle turned out to be positive, underpinned by the Technology sector\u2019s strong growth.\n\nAnd throughout the period, several companies, including Apple AAPL, NVIDIA NVDA, and Celsius Holdings CELH, have posted quarterly records.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

No, I\u2019m not prognosticating an imminent calamity. Rather, I just think it\u2019s smart to think ahead.\n\nEssentially, stocks to buy for a down market is Wall Street\u2019s equivalent of an emergency kit. You do have one of those, don\u2019t you? Because if you don\u2019t, you should get one. Sure, it might seem like a waste of time and money, especially if an emergency doesn\u2019t materialize. But that\u2019s the thing \u2013 unexpected calamities have a way of being, you know, unexpected.\n\nSimilarly, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to get uber-rich with these stocks to buy for a down market. However, should the red ink start flying, you\u2019re going to sleep easier buying these giants on the dip.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nJohnson & Johnson (JNJ) A red Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) sign hangs inside in Moscow, Russia.\n\nSource: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.com\n\nA pharmaceutical giant, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is now a more streamlined operation, having spun off its consumer health products division. While I have some reservations about the move, in the long run, it may unlock value for stakeholders prior to the spinoff. Looking ahead, though, J&J itself should benefit from rising permanent demand.\n\nAccording to Acumen Research and Consulting, the global pharmaceutical market reached a valuation of $1.5 trillion in 2022. Analysts anticipate that the sector will expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.4% from 2023 to 2032. At the forecast\u2019s culmination point, the industry should be worth $2.8 trillion.\n\nAnother factor benefiting JNJ as one of the stocks to buy for a down market is the value proposition. Even without a downcycle, shares trade at a modest trailing-year earnings multiple of 13.29X. If the red ink starts flying, JNJ should be more attractive.\n\nAnalysts view the company as a consensus moderate buy with a $177.67 price target, implying 10% upside potential.\n\nCoca-Cola (KO) KO stock PEP stock: a can of Coca-cola and a can of Pepsi on either side of a glass of brown soda and sitting on top of a pile of ice\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock\n\nStory continues\n\nA soft-drink giant, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) makes for an ideal play for stocks to buy for a down market because of everyday relevance. Recently, a few major enterprises have demanded an ultimatum regarding work from home: either come back to the office or kiss your job goodbye. With this sharp pivot from the pandemic days, demand for caffeinated products should rise.\n\nAt the same time, consumers have struggled with years of high inflation and spiked borrowing costs. People are still opening their wallets but many sectors have indicated concerns about waning capabilities. So, demand for expensive coffeeshops might fade. Cynically, the trade-down effect should benefit KO stock. The underlying product is cheap (and necessary), thus offering a superior alternative.\n\nTo be sure, KO isn\u2019t exactly a sterling deal on paper. Nevertheless, it offers a forward dividend yield of 3.21%, combined with a payout increase going on 63 years. If you\u2019re looking for stocks to buy for a down market, it doesn\u2019t get much more trustworthy than Coca-Cola.\n\nTarget (TGT) tgt stock\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nOrdinarily, I might go with another big-box retailer other than Target (NYSE:TGT) for stocks to buy for a down market. Yeah, I\u2019m talking about Walmart (NYSE:WMT). If the smelly stuff hits the proverbial fan, Walmart seems more capable of withstanding a wider economic hit. Based on the latest consumer demographic data, Walmart shoppers tend to align with realistic income brackets.\n\nOn the other hand, Target tends to align with consumers within higher income levels. Nevertheless, they both provide one-stop shopping experiences that allow them to stay relevant in the age of e-commerce. Further, what I appreciate about TGT stock specifically is that it\u2019s more \u201ctechnically\u201d undervalued than WMT. The former security is up about 6% on a year-to-date basis while the latter gained over 12%.\n\nAlso, I can\u2019t overlook the better value proposition in terms of passive income. Right now, Target offers a forward dividend yield of 2.91%. On the other hand, WMT is comparatively miserly with a yield of 1.39%. Analysts rate Target a consensus strong buy, which seems reasonable.\n\nCostco (COST) A Costco Wholesale (COST) warehouse in Auburn Hills, Michigan.\n\nSource: ilzesgimene / Shutterstock.com\n\nA similar investment to Target and Walmart, Costco (NASDAQ:COST) should also be on your radar for stocks to buy for a down market. Fundamentally, I appreciate COST stock for its viable consumer demographics. The main takeaway is that shoppers tend to be younger and more upwardly mobile. In other words, Costco\u2019s demo indicates that it starts at a high point and is only rising.\n\nFrom an investment standpoint \u2013 especially in a segment that overlaps with the broader discretionary retail space \u2013 I don\u2019t think you can ask for much better. Now, here\u2019s the thing with COST stock: I wouldn\u2019t buy it at this juncture. Rather, if the market gives you a sizable dip because of some disastrous economic event, Costco is a name to pick up on the cheap.\n\nSome ideas you simply don\u2019t trust when the red stains emerge. That\u2019s because their questionable business models become even more suspect under sever economic duress. But Costco? The retailer has weathered multiple storms. Further, it enjoys natural insulation because of its educated, higher-wage-earning members.\n\nIBM (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\n\nWhen it comes to stocks to buy for a down market, IBM (NYSE:IBM) is an \u201cOG\u201d stock. That\u2019s slang for \u201coriginal gangster\u201d or \u201cgangsta\u201d if you\u2019re really cool. Basically, Big Blue is an authentic, old-school technology investment. While everybody\u2019s been going gaga over enterprises like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) for facilitating artificial intelligence, IBM has been doing AI since most of you were born.\n\nAfter years of languishing in the shadows, it appears that the legacy tech juggernaut is finally receiving some dues. It\u2019s not enough. However, I\u2019m sure long-embattled stakeholders will take a 15% pop to start 2024. Also, in the past 52 weeks, IBM stock gained almost 45%.\n\nIf you peruse IBM-related stories on InvestorPlace, I\u2019ve been pounding my fist on the table for a reason. While other companies may be playing cute games with digital intelligence, IBM has been forwarding real solutions. So, I trust that if heaven forbid a severe downturn impacts the market, I can trust Big Blue on any dips.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother major tech giant with a long history, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the contemporary beneficiaries of the AI boon. Since the start of January, MSFT stock gained just under 10% of market value. In the past 52 weeks, it shot up almost 66%. With everyone still head over heels regarding digital intelligence, Microsoft may continue to rise.\n\nHowever, if the market suffers some indigestion, MSFT would easily rank among the stocks to buy for a down market. It\u2019s not just about the AI investments, which has proven fruitful. However, the utility of generative AI is questionable at this moment. What\u2019s not questionable? Microsoft\u2019s dominance in most other areas of productive technologies.\n\nFor example, the business world might implode without Microsoft\u2019s suite of office products. Programs like Word and Excel \u2013 though they do have their quirks and issues \u2013 remain indispensable. Further, the company dominates the PC operating system market environment.\n\nIf you want to draw some cute pictures, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) might be a better bet. For everything else, there\u2019s Microsoft. It\u2019s a strong buy for a reason.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nTo be 100% clear, if you\u2019re looking for a discounted opportunity, buying tech and e-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) right now is a tricky proposition. Just at a glance, you\u2019re talking about a security that\u2019s traded at a near-60X trailing-year earnings multiple. Not only that, the forward earnings multiple isn\u2019t that much better at 41X. Still, if the red ink starts flying, AMZN should be on your watch list.\n\nIt\u2019s real simple: the company has reached a knowledge-saturation point where it\u2019s likely impossible to put the genie back in the bottle. With Amazon users enjoying the everyday convenience of product and food delivery, less incentive exists to shop in person. More than that, the company\u2019s controversial role as the vacuum cleaner of small businesses everywhere has succeeded in one critical element: fostering effective economies of scale.\n\nThat might help to explain why even in an ecosystem impacted by stubbornly high inflation and interest rates, e-commerce as a percentage of total retail sales continues to rise since the second quarter of 2022.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t make sense until you realize the (evil) genius behind Amazon. Clearly, it\u2019s one of the stocks to buy for a down market.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The semiconductor giant is set to make a mark in the generative AI space, and their core business is showing promising signs of a turnaround.\n\nQualcomm had itself a tough 2023 fiscal year, with revenue declining 19% YOY. Net income and EPS declined 44%, respectively. The company was still overcoming the semiconductor shortage in the back half of 2022, as well as the double digit declines in the handset market. Furthermore, there was a general weakness in IoT spending, heavily influenced by slower demand in the industrial market.\n\nHowever, their latest quarterly results are pointing to a recovery, and Qualcomm continues to make strategic investments into generative AI. In Q1 FY24, revenue increased 5% to $9.9 billion. EPS increased by 24% as they continue to build momentum for their Snapdragon platforms. Furthermore, the company plans to release a CPU AI chip (Snapdragon X Elite) this year expected to run generative AI models 2X faster than its competitors. With the handset segment posting 16% YoY growth in the quarter, this could be a positive sign of a swift recovery underway.\n\nStory continues\n\nNetflix (NFLX) Netflix (NFLX) logo displayed on smartphone on top of pile of money.\n\nSource: izzuanroslan / Shutterstock.com\n\nNetflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is one of the best in class tech stocks for 2024. Their new ad membership plan and cost-cutting measures in 2023 are laying the groundwork for accelerated growth. Furthermore, price increases have further demonstrated their pricing power capabilities, as they aim to increase streaming services market share.\n\nThe past 12 months have been transformative for Netflix, and a number of catalysts signal upside ahead. Netflix new ad-plan membership has been a game changer, and shareholders have yet to see the long-term revenue growth opportunities. The new ad-plan membership is growing 70% quarter over quarter, boosting Netflix\u2019s FCF from operations.\n\nIn FY23, Netflix\u2019s revenue grew 12% YoY, and operating margin expanded 300 basis points from FY22. However, what got Wall Street excited was the company\u2019s FCF hitting a record $6.9 billion. Restructuring efforts, which also included cracking down on password sharing, has been extremely instrumental to the company\u2019s goal of driving long-term shareholder value. Netflix\u2019s pricing power has been a huge strategic advantage for the company, making them ripe for new highs in 2024.\n\nArista Networks (ANET) Image of Arista Networks (ANET) logo on the side of a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nArista Networks (NYSE:ANET) is an American company in the world of computer networking and cloud computing. The company specializes in multilayered network switches that cater to large data centers, cloud computing and other high-performance computing environments.\n\nArista\u2019s network infrastructure is critical for the rapid scaling and deployment of generative AI applications. Their sophisticated network switches allow for greater flexibility, automation, and control over network operations. Arista\u2019s EOS (Extensive Operating System), is the backbone of their solutions with over 75 million cloud network ports deployed in the campus, WAN, and hyperscale environments. Additionally, their Cloudvision platform will drive network flow optimization for data centers.\n\nIt is clear that data centers are the backbone of the artificial intelligence revolution. In Artista\u2019s FY23 results, revenue skyrocketed 34% YOY to $5.86 billion. Net profit surpassed $2 billion for the first time, with EPS up an astonishing 54% to $6.58 per share.

Here\u2019s a look at two EV companies that Wall Street finds particularly attractive \u2014 plus a Warren Buffett EV investment that\u2019s beating Tesla in one key metric.\n\nTesla\n\nWhen people think of EV stocks, Tesla is usually the first one to come to mind.\n\nIn 2023, the company achieved a significant milestone by delivering 1,808,581 EVs, which represents a 38% increase from 2022.\n\nIn the U.S., Tesla\u2019s dominance in the EV market is particularly evident. Data from Kelly Blue Book indicates that 55% of the EVs purchased by Americans in 2023 were Tesla products, highlighting the brand's strong foothold and consumer preference in the domestic market.\n\nHowever, as one of the market's most dynamic mega-cap names, Tesla's shares have experienced considerable volatility. They doubled in value in 2023 but have seen a decline of 18% so far in 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives sees a revival on the horizon. The analyst has placed a price target of $315 on Tesla, implying a potential upside north of 50%.\n\nRead more: Rich young Americans have lost confidence in the stock market \u2014 and are betting on these 3 assets instead. Get in now for strong long-term tailwinds\n\nFord\n\nGiven that Ford's best seller is the F-Series of pickup trucks, the company isn\u2019t considered a pure-play EV stock.\n\nBut the automaker has made significant strides in electrifying its lineup.\n\nIn November 2019, Ford unveiled the Mustang Mach-E, a five-door electric compact SUV. This model hit the market in December 2020 and clinched the 2021 North American SUV of the Year Award. Moreover, Ford launched the all-electric F-150 Lightning pickup in April 2022, marking another significant step in its EV journey.\n\nIn its latest earnings report, Ford highlighted: \u201cSales volumes of the F-150 Lightning pickup and Mustang Mach-E SUV both were up year-over-year and respectively the top-selling electric pickup and No. 3 most popular EV of any type in the U.S. for 2023.\u201d\n\nMorgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas has estimated a price target of $16 on Ford \u2014 around 30% above where the stock sits today.\n\nBYD\n\nChinese EV manufacturer BYD has been a part of investing legend Warren Buffett's portfolio for more than a decade.\n\nIn 2008, Berkshire Hathaway acquired 225 million shares of BYD for $232 million, a move that proved to be highly lucrative. By the end of 2020, as stated in Berkshire\u2019s shareholder letter, their stake was valued at approximately $5.9 billion.\n\nAlthough Buffett later began reducing his stake in BYD, an October 2023 stock exchange filing reported on by Reuters revealed that Berkshire still held a sizable 7.98% stake in the company.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, BYD\u2019s EV sales reached 526,409 vehicles, overtaking Tesla's deliveries of 484,507 EVs, according to Reuters, and displacing it as the top EV manufacturer globally. The Chinese company's success has been attributed to various factors, including its broad lineup with inexpensive models, price cuts, its battery-manufacturing capability, and the Chinese government's support of the country's EV sector.\n\nBYD's shares are not listed in the U.S., but they are traded over-the-counter, so American investors who want to buy the stock would need to choose a broker that supports trading them.\n\nWhat to read next\n\nHere's how you can invest in rental properties without the responsibility of being a landlord 'The biggest crash in history': Robert Kiyosaki warns that millions of 401(k)s and IRAs will be 'toast' \u2014 here's what he likes for protection 'It's not taxed at all': Warren Buffett shares the 'best investment' you can make when battling inflation\n\nThis article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

Amid a dramatic slowdown in sales, companies are throwing in the towel. Mercedes-Benz (OTCMKTS:MBGAF) just scrapped its plans to go all-EV after 2030 while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) just killed its electric car project.\n\nGeneral Motors (NYSE:GM) previously backed off its pledge to be all-electric by 2035. Instead, it will bring back hybrid vehicles and see how EV demand pans out before committing more resources.\u00a0Similarly, Ford (NYSE:F) is delaying spending $12 billion on EVs and will also increase hybrid production.\n\nThere\u2019s carnage everywhere as Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA) is near bankruptcy while Polestar Holding (NASDAQ:PSNY) staved off the same fate with a last-minute $1 billion lifeline.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe green future is looking blood red for EVs. Unfortunately, they ran into the wall of reality. Most car buyers don\u2019t want electric cars. They don\u2019t trust them enough to give up their gas-powered vehicles. From batteries bursting into flames to being unable to charge their cars in bone-chilling temperatures, most car buyers prefer the reliability of existing vehicles.\n\nThat\u2019s why there is only one EV stock to buy today and two that are must-sells now.\n\nEV Stock to Sell No. 1: Lucid Group (LCID) Closeup of the Lucid logo seen at a Lucid showroom in Millbrae, California. LCID stock.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock\n\nLucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID) is one of those luxury EV makers swimming in red ink. It lost $2.8 billion last year or more than double the amount in 2022 as it sold fewer cars than the year before. The automaker may have just received a promise for $6 million from Michigan to site a non-production facility in the state but let the government throw tax dollars into that sinkhole. You don\u2019t have to follow suit.\n\nThe EV stock can\u2019t sell its cars. At $80,000 they are too expensive in a market that can\u2019t move EVs at half the price. And the introduction of a cheaper model won\u2019t help because it still costs more than the average new EV.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe electric car industry hoped that gaining price parity with gas-powered vehicles would be the tipping point for sales growth. The demand still hasn\u2019t materialized. Kelley Blue Book says a new EV averages $55,353, down 11% year over year. The average cost of a new car overall was $47,401, a 3% decline from last year. Despite the convergence, the rate of growth for new EVs stalled out. Just 1.8% more EVs were sold in 2023 than the year before.\n\nAlthough Lucid just dropped the base price of the Air by $8,000 to just under $70,000 because of falling demand it\u2019s still too expensive. And that\u2019s the third time in seven months it cut pricing. The EV maker says it will only produce 9,000 vehicles this year but even that might be too many. LCID stock is one to sell now.\n\nEV Stock to Sell No. 2: Rivian Automotive (RIVN) Rivian (RIVN) All Electric R1T Pickup Truck in a forest green color\n\nSource: Roschetzky Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother luxury EV company trying to go down market is Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ:RIVN). It is the second EV stock you should sell. Don\u2019t wait for the company to unveil its new lower-priced R2S SUV on Mar. 7 before selling. Get out now before more damage can be done.\n\nRivian\u2019s earnings were one of two data points I said investors should use to determine how RIVN stock would go. The financials were worse than expected. While the unveiling of the R2S was the second point to ponder, it\u2019s clear the automaker\u2019s position is too dire for a new model to matter. Even Elon Musk says bankruptcy is a likely outcome for Rivian.\n\nDespite reporting higher than expected revenue and a narrower loss for the fourth quarter, Rivian\u2019s outlook isn\u2019t bright. It is firing 10% of its workforce and forecasts it will produce only 57,000 vehicles this year. That\u2019s essentially flat compared to 2023 and far below the 80,000 expected.\n\nYet with EV sales growth tanking, that might be pie-in-the-sky thinking too. Rivian didn\u2019t announce any new price cuts and the R2S will be priced between $40,000 and $60,000. If it is not near the low price point it could be disastrous. With RIVN stock down 52% already in 2024 now is the time to cut losses and sell the stock.\n\nThe Only EV Stock to Buy: Toyota Motors (TM) Toyota motor corporation logo on dealership building\n\nSource: josefkubes / Shutterstock.com\n\nToyota Motors (NYSE:TM) has been one of the very few automakers showing any sort of common sense in the EV market. While the Japanese car company makes EVs, it didn\u2019t dive head-first into the shallow end of the pool like other automakers. EVs account for less than 1% of all vehicle sales at Toyota or a little more than 100,000 vehicles. More prevalent were hybrids, which represent almost 31%, or 3.6 million of the auto stock\u2019s total 11.2 million vehicles sold.\n\nToyota was skeptical of the headlong rush into all-electric cars and chose instead to focus on hybrids. It turns out the company was right. Car buyers are willing to look at alternative fuel vehicles so long as there is a backup plan in place. The hybrid vehicle gives buyers the assurance they won\u2019t be stuck if the green solution fails. Toyota chose to invest across the full spectrum of energy options and its profits doubled last quarter.\n\nThe Japanese automaker is the leading EV stock to buy today. Arguably, it\u2019s the only one. Even with TM stock up 30% year to date, it has such a clear lead over all its rivals in the hybrid space it is now the one to catch.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer's 5 New Stock Picks for March 2024.\n\nJim Cramer during his February 28 program on CNBC said that as we near the end of the earnings season he's been thinking about the effect of earnings reports on the markets and how these reports and their coverage in the news often cause average investors to make \"snap\" decisions what later turn out to be wrong decisions. Cramer said these reports have programmed us to think short term and ignore the long-term picture or \"nuance.\" Cramer said that the \"way we report on stocks\" is \"not working anymore.\"\n\nCramer is Upset About Earnings News Coverage\n\nCramer gave examples of Home Depot and Lowe's, which recently reported their quarters. Cramer said these two companies are excellent businesses and their quarters were strong but because of the \"beat and raise\" structure of earnings news stories many investors immediately started selling these two stocks after reading news headlines without waiting for conference calls to understand the big picture and future guidance.\n\nCramer said Home Depot shares jumped after the company's earnings call because the management said it feels good about inventories since they were lower than the previous levels at the end of 2023. Cramer said that's what investors wanted to hear and that's why one should not make decisions based on news stories and instead wait for conference calls and details from companies' management. Jim Cramer's New Stock Picks for March 2024\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer aired on CNBC during the last week of February and picked 10 stocks Cramer recommended investors to buy. For each stock we have also mentioned hedge fund sentiment. Instead of companies like \u00a0Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), which Cramer has been recommending for a long time, you will see some new names in the list of Cramer's stock picks.\n\nStory continues\n\n10. Getty Images Holdings Inc (NYSE:GETY)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 2\n\nJim Cramer recently said in his Lightning Round program that his next Nvidia play stock would be Getty Images Holdings Inc (NYSE:GETY).\n\n\"I think Getty Images Holdings Inc (NYSE:GETY) is my next one because that's a mention by Nvidia.\"\n\nJim Cramer was talking about SoundHound AI and why he likes the stock because of the Nvidia factor.\n\nDuring its earnings call in November 2023, Getty Images Holdings Inc (NYSE:GETY) management talked about its partnership with Nvidia:\n\n\"So with that as a backdrop, I\u2019d like to highlight some of the progress we\u2019ve made within the quarter. In partnership with NVIDIA, we launched our generative AI service at the end of the quarter. The service is truly unique and addresses fundamental customer needs. Our model is trained solely with Getty Images Holdings Inc (NYSE:GETY) best-in-class content, addressing the legal risk that is pervasive in many other models that are trained with third-party intellectual property scraped from the web. We also believe this equates to higher quality outputs as a cake is only as good as its ingredients. With generative AI by Getty Images, users can be confident that the content they generate is safe to use in commercial settings and will not include any trademark brands, products, characters, or identifiable people. It also does not produce deep takes or emulate the style of specific orders, which we believe is valued by our editorial and creative customers respectively. We are rewarding our contributors with an ongoing share of each and every dollar we earn from the service. Last but certainly not least, the service and all of its outputs come with Getty Images uncapped indemnification. In terms of the economics, customers pay to generate versus download, which better aligns to our costs and recognize the value of ideation. Initial customer feedback and engagement with the service has been really positive and we have already introduced new features to the service such as being able to prompt in over 70 languages. And we\u2019re engaged with a limited set of customers to custom-train models to their IP and brand needs.\"\n\nRead the full earnings call transcript here.\n\n9. SoundHound AI Inc (NASDAQ:SOUN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 13\n\nJim Cramer was recently asked about his thoughts on SoundHound AI Inc (NASDAQ:SOUN). Cramer is bullish on SoundHound AI Inc (NASDAQ:SOUN) because of the Nvidia factor. Cramer said \"that's Nvidia play\" while talking about SoundHound AI Inc (NASDAQ:SOUN).\n\nSoundHound AI Inc (NASDAQ:SOUN) has gained about 204% year to date. The stock is roaring after Nvidia revealed a $3.7 million stake in the company while SoftBank bought 1.1 million shares of SoundHound AI Inc (NASDAQ:SOUN). SoundHound AI Inc (NASDAQ:SOUN) makes voice AI solutions for automotive, restaurants and hospitality industries.\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 13 hedge funds had stakes in SoundHound AI Inc (NASDAQ:SOUN).\n\n8. Public Storage (NYSE:PSA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 28\n\nPublic Storage (NYSE:PSA) ranks eighth in our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recommended in his Lightning Round program on CNBC this week. Cramer said Public Storage (NYSE:PSA) stock is down \"on an opportunity.\" Cramer quoted Public Storage (NYSE:PSA) skeptics who say there is a lot of oversaturation in the market for self-storage companies. Cramer said in response to these naysayers:\n\n\"Give me a break. These guys are very smart operators. I want to buy the stock.\"\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 28 hedge funds out of the 933 funds in Insider Monkey's database had stakes in Public Storage (NYSE:PSA). The biggest stakeholder of the company during this period was Ken Griffin's Citadel Investment Group which owns a $221 million stake.\n\nIn addition to PSA, Cramer is also recommending \u00a0Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nBaron Real Estate Fund stated the following regarding Public Storage (NYSE:PSA) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cIn the most recently reported quarter, business results for\u00a0Public Storage (NYSE:PSA), a REIT that is the world\u2019s largest owner, operator, and developer of self-storage facilities, were mildly disappointing as occupancy trends and rents moderated as a result of less housing-related movement and a more price-sensitive consumer. We decided to sell our position because we believe near-term rent and overall cash-flow growth may remain subdued. We are likely to revisit Public Storage in the future.\u201d\n\n7. DigitalBridge Group Inc (NYSE:DBRG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 31\n\nA caller recently asked Jim Cramer about DigitalBridge Group, Inc. (NYSE:DBRG), which he said was once a REIT but later transformed into a \"profitable global alternative asset manager.\" Jim Cramer said he remembers DigitalBridge Group, Inc. (NYSE:DBRG) from its REIT days and wanted the company to do exactly what it's doing today. Jim Cramer said DigitalBridge Group, Inc. (NYSE:DBRG) is a \"good stock\" and praised the caller for making the right call on the stock.\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 31 hedge funds out of the 933 funds in Insider Monkey's database had stakes in DigitalBridge Group, Inc. (NYSE:DBRG). The most notable stake in the company is owned by Charles Akre's Akre Capital Management which owns a $77 million stake in the company.\n\nAve Maria Focused Fund made the following comment about DigitalBridge Group, Inc. (NYSE:DBRG) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cDigitalBridge Group, Inc. (NYSE:DBRG) started its life with particularly complicated financials as the two data center businesses it owned directly obfuscated the economics of its asset management business. However, DigitalBridge plans to divest enough of their ownership in these two businesses that they will no longer be required to consolidate them in their reported financials. Consequently, its reported financials will be much simpler to analyze and reflect the profile of a pure-play alternative asset manager. DigitalBridge differentiates itself by focusing exclusively on digital infrastructure, an asset class that institutional allocators are severely under allocated to. DigitalBridge is actively fundraising for its third flagship investment fund. With an expected 11-year fund life, this fund could generate fees for the company and its investors for a long time.\n\nWe are confident that these three alternative investment managers will grow their respective businesses substantially over the next five years. This should provide ample growth in their stock prices and, consequently, the Fund\u2019s positions in them.\u201d\n\n6. Cloudflare Inc (NYSE:NET)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 44\n\nJim Cramer was recently asked about Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) during his \"Lightning Round\" program on CNBC. Cramer said Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) is one of his \"absolute favorite stocks.\" Jim Cramer said that there's \"such a fantastic narrative there.\"\n\n\"You must hold on to Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET).\"\n\nJim Cramer also recommended investors to buy more Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) if the stock takes a hit.\n\nIn addition to Cloudflare, Cramer is also bullish on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nBaron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund stated the following regarding Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cMost of our portfolio companies have seen stabilization and modest improvements in short-term business fundamentals as the year progressed. More importantly in our view, many have been able to drive significant improvement in long-term Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as share gains, meaningful expansion of their total addressable market, and improvement in unit economics. These KPIs are significantly more important in driving the intrinsic values of our businesses, which we believe have increased noticeably during 2023. In the meantime, disruptive changes that we expect will benefit many of our businesses have also continued to pick up steam. Some examples include: \u2022 Another example is the leading cloud networking and cybersecurity solution provider,\u00a0Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET), who described market share gains and customers consolidating from multiple point solutions to Cloudflare\u2019s platform: \u201cAnd so we\u2019re the one vendor that is able to give people that vendor consolidation, that single pane of glass\u2026 that comes through in a lot of customer examples\u2026. people want to buy the entire Cloudflare platform. They want to protect their entire business with that, and that\u2019s driving more interest in both our network security, as well as our Zero Trust products.\u201d\n\nClick to continue reading and see Jim Cramer's 5 New Stock Picks for March 2024.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nWall Street Analysts See Upside Potential for 10 Stocks with Rising Price Targets 10 Stocks with 50% Upside Potential According to Analysts 12 Extreme Dividend Stocks With Upside Potential\n\nDisclosure.

The iPhone 15 launch came at a time of slowing sales for Apple in China where it faces rising competitive pressure from domestic rivals like Huawei and Xiaomi.\n\nLast month, Apple offered discounts on iPhones on its official sites by up to 500 yuan in an unusual move.\n\nOn Thursday, the third-party retailers were offering discounts on all four models of the iPhone 15 series, including the iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, Reuters checks showed, with some models on sale at up to 1,300 yuan ($180.68) less than the usual price.\n\nLocal media reported the price cuts and the three online retailers have branded the discounts as part of the upcoming International Women's Day campaign which falls on March 8th, but have not said how long the promotions will last.\n\nApple, JD.com, Alibaba which operates the Tmall platform, and PDD didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe retailers have been engaged in a \"value for money\" battle as consumers tighten their belts in a slowing economy, with discounting a focus during some of the major shopping holidays and events.\n\nAccording to checks made by Reuters, Pinduoduo is offering the 128GB version of the iPhone 15 for 4,588 yuan on their website - 1,411 yuan less than Apple's retail price of 5,999 yuan.\n\nThe 256GB iPhone 15 Pro Max, which typically retails for 9,999 yuan in Apple's store, can be purchased for 8,899 yuan on JD.com's flagship e-commerce platform.\n\n($1 = 7.1951 Chinese yuan renminbi)\n\n(Reporting by Yelin Mo and Brenda Goh;Editing by Elaine Hardcastle)", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chinese-retailers-further-discount-iphone-123058190.html", "symbols": ["0R2V.IL", "9PDA.F", "9PDA.STU", "AAPL.BA", "AAPL.MX", "AAPL.NEO", "AAPL.SN", "AAPL.US", "AAPL34.SA", "APC.BE", "APC.DU", "APC.F", "APC.HA", "APC.HM", "APC.MU", "APC.STU", "APC.XETRA", "APC8.F", "P1DD34.SA", "PDD.US"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.691, "neg": 0.032, "neu": 0.924, "pos": 0.045}}, {"date": "2024-02-29T12:19:23+00:00", "title": "Germany wants Big Tech to pay towards compliance costs of new digital law", "content": "By Foo Yun Chee\n\nBERLIN (Reuters) - Germany wants Big Tech companies Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, ByteDance, Meta Platforms and Microsoft to contribute towards the compliance costs of new European Union rules aimed at curbing their power, a senior German economy ministry official said on Thursday.\n\nSven Giegold, state secretary in charge of competition policy at Germany's economy ministry, said such a move would help EU antitrust regulators better enforce the Digital Markets Act (DMA) which the six companies have to comply with on March 7.\n\nThe landmark rules set out a list of requirements for the six companies, such as allowing rival services to inter-operate with their services, as well as letting business users promote their offer and conclude contracts with their customers outside their platforms.\n\nThe six companies are prohibited from unfairly ranking their own services and products above their rivals on their platforms or preventing users from un-installing any pre-installed software or app on their devices.\n\n\"The (European) Commission needs additional resources for enforcement,\" Giegold told a conference organised by the German antitrust agency.\n\n\"We propose for the DMA we should introduce the same fee financing as under the DSA (Digital Services Act),\" he said.\n\nUnder the DSA, which requires Big Tech to do more to police content on their platforms, 20 very large online platforms, including Meta, Google, Apple, TikTok, and also two very large online search engines, have to pay a supervisory fee amounting to 0.05% of their annual worldwide net income.\n\nThe DMA does not have such a supervisory fee.\n\nGiegold also said EU antitrust enforcers should focus more on key sectors with an international aspect to help European companies compete better globally.\n\n\"Next week we will be formally submitting a concrete German proposal that is for the EU level.

A spokesperson for Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe company had spent substantial investments in research and development and other capital expenditure on the Kulim chip fab, according to a note by JPMorgan analyst Sandeep Deshpande, who said the customer was likely Apple.\n\nAMS-Osram was expanding the plant to produce micro-LED displays, which has long been tipped to be the next major upgrade in display technology for consumer wearables, such as smartwatches.\n\nTheir development, however, has taken longer than expected. According to an August report by Taipei-based research firm TrendForce, the rollout of micro-LED on the Apple Watch was pushed back to 2026 from 2025.\n\nAMS-Osram has invested heavily in the micro-LED space. The company committed \u20ac800 million in 2022 to expand its manufacturing facility in Kulim. It had expected its first revenue from the technology in 2025.\n\nStory continues\n\nShares tumbled as much as 45% in Zurich to 1.21 Swiss francs, the lowest since its 2009 initial public offering. Aixtron SE, which supplies chipmaking equipment to AMS-Osram, slumped as much as 22%, also weighed down by results that showed a worse-than-expected operating margin outlook and lacked any guidance on orders.\n\nAMS-Osram will incur an impairment charge of \u20ac600 million ($651 million) to \u20ac900 million in the current quarter as it reviews the value of assets linked to the project involving micro-LED technology, it said in a statement on Wednesday. It cut its guidance for medium-term sales growth to as much as 8% from 10%.\n\nThe firm\u2019s business struggles were exacerbated by a downturn in the semiconductor industry and a slowdown in consumer device demand. The debt-laden firm has been in a turnaround process, with \u20ac2.25 billion raised in a refinancing plan completed in December. Both Kamper and Chief Financial Officer Rainer Irle assumed their roles less than a year ago.\n\n\u201cWith this project now canceled, we believe that the shares will take a major hit as long-term growth prospects will be much lower without the micro LED opportunity,\u201d said Stifel analyst Juergen Wagner, referring to AMS-Osram.\n\nBond Drop\n\nAMS-Osram\u2019s bonds also took a beating on the news, with a \u20ac625 million 10.5% bond maturing in March 2029 dropping 8 cents on the euro to a cash price of 102.6 cents, according to Bloomberg pricing source CBBT at 11:20 a.m. London.\n\nA zero-coupon convertible bond maturing in March 2025 also fell by 3 cents, to a cash price of 92.5 cents on the euro.\n\nThis convertible bond was issued in the low-rate era in 2018, when many technology-related firms were able to essentially get free debt in exchange for exposure to their stock. Since rates have risen, many of these bonds have tumbled as the underlying stocks have cratered.\n\nIn the case of AMS-Osram, these convertible bonds were designed to convert into shares at \u20ac50.1886 upon maturity in 2025. This is a nearly 3,000% premium to the current share price.\n\n--With assistance from Allegra Catelli and Alexey Anishchuk.\n\n(Updates with details throughout.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nChina\u2019s Piano Dreams Are Fading for a Cash-Strapped Middle Class Elon Musk\u2019s Vegas Tunnel Project Has Been Racking Up Safety Violations Hollywood Is Banking on Dune: Part Two to Revive the Blockbuster Experience There\u2019s One Musk Endeavor That\u2019s Not Doing So Great Hong Kong\u2019s Hottest New Store Is the Costco in Shenzhen\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-supplier-ams-osram-plunges-114247776.html", "symbols": ["0R2V.IL", "AAPL.BA", "AAPL.MX", "AAPL.NEO", "AAPL.SN", "AAPL.US", "AAPL34.SA", "APC.BE", "APC.DU", "APC.F", "APC.HA", "APC.HM", "APC.MU", "APC.STU", "APC.XETRA", "APC8.F"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.987, "neg": 0.039, "neu": 0.875, "pos": 0.086}}, {"date": "2024-02-29T10:44:56+00:00", "title": "India Okays $15 Billion of Milestone Chip Plant Investments", "content": "(Bloomberg) -- India\u2019s government has approved $15.2 billion worth of investments in semiconductor fabrication plants, including a Tata Group proposal to build the country\u2019s first major chipmaking facility.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow Much Wealth You Need to Join the Richest 1% Around the World Apple to Wind Down Electric Car Effort After Decadelong Odyssey Fed\u2019s Preferred Inflation Metric Increases by Most in a Year Singapore\u2019s Richest Banking Dynasty Grapples With Succession This Is Where New Migrants Are Going When They Reach the US\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s cabinet approved Tata\u2019s plan to build an $11 billion site that can fabricate about 50,000 wafers per month, technology minister Ashwini Vaishnaw told reporters in New Delhi Thursday.

The new facility will produce so-called mature chips \u2014 using 40-nanometer or older technology \u2014 that are widely used in consumer electronics, automobiles, defense systems and aircrafts.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe $150 billion Tata group has previously said it plans to begin construction of a chip fabrication plant in Dholera this year. At 50,000 wafers per month, the envisioned Tata site is a modest size compared with facilities of its kind around the world.\n\nRead More: Apple Supplier Foxconn Begins iPhone 15 Production in India\n\nThe moves are part of Tata\u2019s nascent push to invest billions of dollars in high-tech businesses.

Here's how to dry out your smartphone", "content": "LONDON (AP) \u2014 You were walking next to a swimming pool when you slipped and dropped your phone into the water. Or it slipped out of your hand when you were next to a filled bathtub or toilet.\n\nHowever your smartphone got wet, you now need to dry it. But what do you do? There's lots of advice on the internet, some of it conflicting. Apple inserted itself into the debate recently when it put out an advisory that included a warning against using rice.\n\nHere are some things to keep in mind next time your phone has an unintended encounter with a liquid.\n\nWhat you should do\n\nDry off the exterior with a towel or clean cloth, even your shirtsleeve \u2014 anything that's absorbent. Take out the SIM card and holder. If possible, remove the back housing and battery to wipe them dry. Also, if possible, turn the phone off.\n\niPhones can't be disassembled so Apple recommends tapping it gently against your hand with the connector ports facing down so liquid can flow out.\n\nSamsung, which is the biggest maker of Android phones, recommends using a cotton bud to get moisture out of the earphone jack and charging port. In contrast, Apple says cotton buds shouldn't be inserted into iPhone openings.\n\nIf it's not water but another liquid \u2014 a drink, seawater or chlorinated pool water \u2014 Samsung advises soaking the phone in clean water for a few minutes then rinsing it to get rid of any impurities or salinity that could speed up corrosion of the circuitry inside.\n\nBoth companies say it's best to leave the phone out in a well ventilated area (perhaps with a fan) to dry it out. Google says leave the device to dry at room temperature.\n\nWhat you shouldn\u2019t do\n\nDon\u2019t use a hair dryer or compressed air on your phone. Don\u2019t put it in a freezer - this might stop your device from short-circuiting but the problem will be back once you try to thaw it. And while this might seem obvious, don't put your device in a tumble dryer or on top of a radiator.\n\nDon't power it up or try to charge it with a cable \u2014 although wireless charging is OK if your phone has it and you really need to turn it on in an emergency.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo what about using rice to dry your device? You may have heard that putting a phone in a bowl of rice will help draw out moisture. It\u2019s been a tip that\u2019s been out there for years.\n\nApple, however, says that's a no-no. The company warned against it in an advisory published in early January. It drew little attention at the time, but then people noticed the line that said: \u201cDon\u2019t put your iPhone in a bag of rice. Doing so could allow small particles of rice to damage your iPhone.\u201d\n\nIs there anything I can use besides rice?\n\nThe best option is silica gel, a drying agent that can absorb lots of moisture. Silica gel beads are typically found in packets that are included with products like beef jerky, seaweed sheets or sneakers to keep them dry. You can also buy them in bulk online. This works best if you put them in an airtight box with your phone.\n\nWhen do I know it's dry?\n\nIt's hard to tell but it's best to wait as long as possible \u2014 at least a few days. Samsung advises bringing your device into a service center for inspection even after it's been air-dried.\n\nAren't phones waterproof nowadays?\n\nMost phones nowadays are designed to be water-resistant, which means they can resist water entering critical areas for a certain amount of time. But beware, this isn't the same as being waterproof.\n\nApple says the iPhone 7 and and newer models are splash and water resistant. iPhone XS devices and up have the IP68 rating, which means they can be submerged for as long as 30 minutes and, depending on the model, as deep as 6 meters (20 feet). These models also pop up a warning if there's liquid detected in key ports, and warn against charging. Samsung says most of its Galaxy Android phones feature the same rating, though the maximum depth is about 5 meters (16 feet).\n\nGoogle's newer Pixel phones carry the same water resistance ratings, but Google warns that they aren't waterproof and the water resistance will diminish over time because of \u201cnormal wear and tear, device repair, disassembly or damage.\"", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/one-tech-tip-dont-rice-095437393.html", "symbols": ["0R2V.IL", "AAPL.BA", "AAPL.MX", "AAPL.NEO", "AAPL.SN", "AAPL.US", "AAPL34.SA", "APC.BE", "APC.DU", "APC.F", "APC.HA", "APC.HM", "APC.MU", "APC.STU", "APC.XETRA", "APC8.F"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.984, "neg": 0.04, "neu": 0.889, "pos": 0.071}}, {"date": "2024-02-29T07:39:37+00:00", "title": "Xiaomi founder Lei Jun followed Apple into the EV market.

The Chinese smartphone maker embraces Apple-like designs in its products and advertising, leading some to dub the company \"the Apple of China.\" And Lei cites Steve Jobs as an inspiration, saying that the 1984 book Fire in the Valley put him on the path to launching his own company.\n\nAnd so it wasn't a big surprise when, in March 2021, Xiaomi announced it was entering the EV space, following Apple's 2014 decision to explore building a car. At the time, Xiaomi promised to spend $10 billion over 10 years to eventually offer \"quality smart electric vehicles.\"\n\nBut now Apple's car plans are reportedly dead, with the U.S. tech company shifting personnel to AI projects instead.\n\nThe man behind the \"Apple of China\" said he was \"shocked\" by Apple's decision, in a Wednesday post on Chinese social media platform Weibo. He continued that Xiaomi made a \"strategic choice\" to invest in EVs, and that the company remains committed to the project, despite the difficulty.\n\nIn December, Lei told state broadcaster CCTV that Xiaomi devoted 3,400 engineers and 10 billion Chinese renminbi ($1.4 billion) towards the company's first prototype vehicle. He noted that the overall investment was 10 times higher than what automakers generally devote to new models.\n\nXiaomi can break into the car market because EVs combine elements of both traditional automobiles and consumer electronics, Lei said at the time.\n\nThe smartphone maker unveiled its first EV, the SU7 electric sedan, in late December.

But in the end some analysts say it\u2019s likely a good thing for the tech juggernaut.\n\n\u201cA successful and profitable company such as Apple has little to gain from building their own vehicle,\u201d said Sam Fiorani of AutoForecast Solutions, a research firm specializing in the automotive manufacturing sector. \"The minefields currently being traversed by the likes of Rivian and Lucid should have informed executives at Apple just how difficult an endeavor this would have been.\u201d\n\nIn recent months it seems Apple executives did come to this conclusion. According to Bloomberg,after pushing out deadlines and features set for the car recently, it became more obvious that building a car from the bottom up was going to be expensive. At the same time, the car would be entering a market already saturated with EV competition with the likes of Tesla, Rivian, and Lucid at the higher end \u2014 and one where demand was softening substantially. Even Big Three automakers like Ford and GM have warned about waning EV demand in their Q4 earnings statements. Apple next-gen CarPlay will extend beyond the central display, encompassing the instrument cluster and additional screens. (Apple) (Apple)\n\n\u201cSince Apple farms out much of its product manufacturing to other firms, it was unlikely that any vehicle they developed would have been assembled in-house, however marketing such a vehicle would have required something more than Geniuses at the mall Apple Store,\u201d Fiorani said, highlighting the challenges Apple faced in the market.\n\nAnd unlike other EV makers, Apple wouldn't be able to capitalize on its data, since it already gets so much of it through its ubiquitous iPhones.\n\n\u201cNew vehicle startups of the last two decades have focused their long-term energy on data, which is Apple\u2019s core business today,\u201d Fiorani said, referring to Rivian and Lucid. \u201cThe iPhone already gathers so much information on its owners that the cost to start a vehicle division couldn\u2019t possibly pay off in enough additional data to offset the financial risk.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nApple has before dabbled in product areas outside of its core and then dropped plans if they proved unlikely to be profitable. For years Apple was rumored to be making its own high-end flat screen TV for consumers. But as the market for LCD and LED TVs became less profitable, Apple withdrew those efforts and stuck to making external monitors.\n\nThe better play for Apple's foray into autos, as many analysts have noted, is sticking with software and helping legacy automakers create a better user experience for their customers. With Apple CarPlay software for vehicles, Apple could add value by focusing on Apple\u2019s core competencies like design and user interaction and enjoy higher and more stable profit margins.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s software-driven vehicles need engineers, like those at Apple, to create a system to gather, process, harness, and utilize data from drivers, passengers, and the vehicles themselves,\u201d Fiorani added. \u201cThis is a bigger potential windfall than the actual development of a vehicle.\u201d\n\nWall Street reaction from analysts at firms including Morgan Stanley, CFRA, and Wedbush Securities has been universally positive on Apple's cancellation of its car project, though they acknowledged that the costs incurred are not ideal. Nevertheless Apple\u2019s pivot from a car to other endeavors like generative AI are welcome.\n\n\u201cAs Apple Car bears, we believe this report, if true, represents a positive step forward in 1) focusing on what matters, and 2) exhibiting cost discipline,\u201d Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas wrote in a note to investors on Wednesday morning. \u201cWe believe the engineering talent, CAPEX investments, and time spent on Project Titan are better repurposed into related technologies, such as Generative AI, which has a much higher probability of coming to market and strengthening Apple's competitive moat\u2026 Any new talent that can help further Apple's AI progress is a net positive, in our view.\u201d\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Cook said that the iPhone maker sees \"incredible breakthrough potential for generative AI, which is why we're currently investing significantly in this area.

It also slightly raised its sales forecast for fiscal year 2023. Its share price surged by nearly 8% following the earnings released because it beat analyst expectations.\n\nTM stock offers investors a dividend yield of approximately 1.9% on an annual basis, with a dividend amount of $2.00 per share distributed semi-annually. Following the\u00a0large growth that Toyota is experiencing, there may be plans to raise it in the near term.\n\nOn a global level, Toyota is one of the largest vehicle manufacturing companies.

The growth in subscribers was in line with what Netflix experienced during the pandemic; this can be attributed to Netflix\u2019s initiative to stop password sharing,\u00a0which was a massive success for the company.\n\nNetflix is a streaming giant. Its share price over this past year has risen by 88%. The customer base for Netflix is much greater than that of other streaming competitors such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NYSE:AAPL), giving them a massive advantage within the streaming landscape.

To skip the detailed analysis of the recent events in the stock market, go directly to the 5 Stocks That Will Double in 2024.\n\nLast year turned out to be wondrous for the US stock market as the S&P 500 gained over 25% compared to its 18% decline in the previous year. However, almost all of the gains were attributed to the Magnificent 7, which got a huge boost in investor sentiment due to the artificial intelligence (AI) trend. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) was one of the stocks that doubled in 2023, while NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was able to gain nearly 240%. Because of last year's performance, analysts expect good things to happen in 2024 too.\n\nFor the Magnificent 7, analysts have mixed opinions, as some of them believe that the 2023 rally has made these stocks overvalued. The rest of them believe that the AI revolution is real and there is no stop in sight in the near future. Apart from the seven big tech stocks, Wall Street analysts also have faith in some other stocks such as NetEase, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTES), CyberArk Software Ltd. (NASDAQ:CYBR), and HubSpot, Inc. (NYSE:HUBS) and believe that AI is a huge growth catalyst for them.\n\nThe former hedge fund manager and host of CNBC\u2019s Mad Money, Jim Cramer, holds the Magnificent 7 in high regard. However, he believes Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) to be the weak link among the group and suggests Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) to be its replacement. Cramer also has mixed views about Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the short-term but still sees it in a favorable light for the long term due to iPhone sales and Apple Vision Pro.\n\nFor 2024, the technology sector still seems to be holding a celebrity status among analysts and financial media. Nevertheless, some other sectors that can get a huge boost due to the AI revolution include the healthcare and industrial sectors. The industrial sector can benefit from AI as it can help the industry in cost cutting, more effective performance tracking, and enhanced productivity due to AI automation.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the other hand, while the healthcare sector benefits significantly from AI, it is also a defensive sector that can weather any unforeseen events like we experienced over the last three years. Additionally, AI is quite an old tool in the healthcare industry. Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG) has integrated AI and machine learning into the evolution of its surgical robotics for several years. Similarly, another healthcare company, Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) has been using AI for a while now and also has plans to boost further integration of the technology in its operations. Its chairman and CEO, Geoff Martha, said the following at the company\u2019s latest earnings call:\n\n\u201c...we've had a rapid cadence of new product approvals and we're continuing to differentially invest in our pipeline of highest growth opportunities. We're advancing innovative core technologies like robotics, AI and closed-loop systems. And with five AI products already FDA approved, we're leading the way in bringing the tech into MedTech.

The company started off managing call centers but has since evolved into a high-tech business process outsourcer (BPO) that also designs and runs customer-facing websites and apps, integrates the data, and optimizes a client\u2019s customer interactions. CX is a relatively new business, and Concentrix has been acquiring smaller competitors. In March, 2023 they bought WebHelp, a leading European CX player, for $4.8B in cash and stock.22 We believe the WebHelp acquisition will help consolidate an industry where Concentrix and Teleperformance are the largest players. The company was spun out from TD Synnex, another of the Fund\u2019s core holdings, and we have always been impressed with the company\u2019s innovation and growth. The market is currently worried about the potential of artificial intelligence to disrupt Concentrix\u2019 core call center business and shares of all CX companies have underperformed.\u201d\n\n8.

Here is what it said:\n\n\u201cOur last addition during the quarter was to the leading freelance platform, Fiverr International Ltd. The company\u2019s revenue growth rates remain negatively impacted by macro factors as it\u2019s relatively easy for customers to hire fewer freelancers when they must cut budgets in the near term. However, we are encouraged by the company\u2019s rapid progress on the profitability front (with guidance for EBITDA margins to be approximately 16% for 2023 compared to 7% in 2022), early signs of revenue growth acceleration, and its significant long-term opportunity as freelance work continues growing. These factors present a positively skewed risk/reward opportunity for long-term investors, especially with the shares trading at a 9% FCF yield. We have therefore decided to add to our position.\u201d\n\n7. Perion Network Ltd. (NASDAQ:PERI)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 23\n\nPerion Network Ltd.

But it's really about three names this time around.\n\nNvidia (NVDA), Meta (META) and Amazon (AMZN) have significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (^GSPC) to start 2024. Nvidia has led the trio, surging nearly 60% compared to the benchmark index's 6% increase.\n\nThe three names have also topped the performance of their peers in the \"Magnificent 7.\" Microsoft (MSFT) has gained about 8% this year. Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), and Tesla (TSLA) have lost value through about two months of trade in 2024.\n\nThe stock moves are largely earnings based. In the current earnings season,Nvidia once again blew out expectations. Meta announced plans for a $50 billion share repurchase program and the company's first ever dividend. Meanwhile, Amazon surprised to the upside with its revenue metrics.\n\nOver the last 30 days as Wall Street analysts digested the latest round of corporate results from all seven big tech players, Meta, Amazon, and Nvidia saw the largest increases in earnings projections for both the current year and next year, according to research from DataTrek co-founder Jessica Rabe,\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla and Microsoft negative earnings shifts were the only two of the group to see their earnings estimates move lower by more than the S&P 500 for next year.\n\nThe quarterly results of these companies are likely to shape the direction of the market at large. On Tuesday, Barclays head of US equity strategy Venu Krishna wrote that big tech earnings per share estimates for 2024 have \"improved considerably\" and moved up the floor for total S&P 500 earnings projection this year.\n\nConsequently, the firm moved up its year-end target for the S&P 500 to 5,300 from 4,800 in part because of big tech earnings expectations. Goldman Sachs recently struck a similar tone in it's call for the S&P 500 to end this year at 5,200.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"US Big Tech\u2019s superior earnings estimate momentum versus the S&P 500 as a whole goes a long way in explaining why most of them have been able to continue to build on their [more than one] year run of outperformance,\" DataTrek co-founder Jessica Rabe wrote in a note to clients on Monday night. \"As much as rates have risen this year, most Big Tech names are in considerably better fundamental shape than the broader US equity market.\n\n\"As long as they keep delivering on earnings results in the same manner as last quarter, most of these stocks should keep outperforming and driving the S&P higher.\" FILE - A Nvidia office building is shown in Santa Clara, Calif., May 31, 2023.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. And now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Jennifer Gaumond, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJennifer Gaumond: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on today's conference call to discuss Jamf's fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results. With me on today's call are John Strosahl Chief Executive Officer; and Ian Goodkind, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that shortly after the market closed today, we issued a press release announcing our fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results. We also published a Q4 earnings presentation, investor presentation and Excel file containing quarterly financial statements to assist with modeling. You may access this information on the Investor Relations section of gan.com. Today's discussion may include forward-looking statements.\n\nPlease refer to our most recent SEC reports, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, where you will see a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. I would also like to remind you that during the call, we will discuss some non-GAAP measures related to Jamf's performance. You can find the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures in our earnings release. Additionally, to ensure we can address as many analyst questions as possible during the call, we ask that you please limit your questions to one initial question and one follow-up. Now I'd like to turn the call over to John.\n\nStory continues\n\nJohn Strosahl: Thanks, Jen. Jamf achieved strong results in Q4 to round out the year, exceeding expectations for the 15th consecutive quarter. Q4 year-over-year revenue growth was 16%, representing the first quarter of revenue growth acceleration since Q2 of 2021. This strong revenue growth led to our highest non-GAAP operating income quarter ever at $21.1 million, with a non-GAAP operating income margin of 14%. This represents a 700 basis points improvement from Q4 of 2022. Full year revenue growth was 17% and ARR grew 15% year-over-year in 2023 to $588.6 million. Full year non-GAAP operating income was $45.4 million, a 75% increase over 2022. This resulted in a full year non-GAAP operating income margin of 8%, a 300 basis points improvement over 2022.\n\nWe're especially proud of these strong results as the past six quarters have seen muted growth in the education and tech industries overall, along with slow PC growth. Q4 PC shipments declined nearly 3% with Mac shipments seeing a decline of 18%. We remain optimistic regarding the potential for a 2024 PC refresh cycle as predicted by IDC. However, our expectations for 2024 are not reliant on a significant uplift in device expansion. Longer term, we're still confident in our prediction that Apple technology will become the number one ecosystem in the enterprise due to continued user preference for Mac at work. We ended 2023 with 75,300 customers and 32.3 million devices on our platform. Of these customers, 41% run both Jamf management and a security product.\n\nThis represents a significant increase due to the transition of our Jamf Now customers to Jamf Fundamentals. Jamf Fundamentals provides the most complete yet simple IT solution for small- to medium-sized businesses to manage and protect their Apple ecosystem. Other highlights include a continued demand for Jamf's Apple first security platform with 33% year-over-year growth in Security ARR to $134 million or 23% of Jamf's total ARR. Our strongest quarter ever for ARR added for Jamf business plan. Many of our largest sales had an upsell component, proving the value of our land and expand strategy. we continue to see positive trends across professional services, financial services and retail, which are three of the top five industries we serve, and we also saw a strong quarter in health care.\n\nOur results were driven by strong performance across our strategic focus areas of Mac leadership, management and security and Mac in Mobile. In Mac leadership, we're seeing continued growth in our customer base with customers like a leading fully integrated biopharmaceutical solutions organization. The Company has been a Jamf customer for nine years and after finding that their Mac platform required fewer support tickets and a lower total cost of ownership decided to take the next step and scale out their Mac Choice program with Jamf. The Company expects to use over 5,000 Mac's in the near future as a result of their upcoming refresh cycle. Moving to security. Last week, we released our Security 360 report that looks at real-world customer data, cutting-edge threat research and noteworthy industry events to provide an overview of the evolving threat landscape.\n\nAmong many striking data points, I wanted to highlight, we are now tracking 300 malware families on the Mac operating system, 21 of those families being found in 2023. It is true that Apple builds one of the most secure out-of-the-box platforms on the market, but hackers are agnostic as to the platforms they target. Jamf is the only platform that delivers an Apple First integrated management and security solution that meets the needs of the modern enterprise. Jamf enhances Apple's built-in security features by increasing visibility, prevention controls and remediation capabilities. We anticipate security to continue to become a larger part of our total ARR over time. Much of our success in security has been predicated on our ability to deliver both management and security on one platform.\n\nThe success of Jamf's bundled solution is a testament to this with ARR growth of bundled solutions outpacing most of Jamf's individual products. In Q4, over 44% of new customer pipeline generated was for security. Security products are also helping us to increase our win rates. When customers come to Jamf with security in mind, we win almost twice as often as we do when customers are looking at management alone. This was true in both Q3 and Q4, and we expect this trend to continue. We also see long-term management customers expanding with Jamf for security. In Q4, a European payments company added Jamf Protect to its 5,000 Mac's as part of a three-year agreement. Given the Company's exposure to PII and payment information, it has strict security and regulatory requirements.\n\nOur team was able to demonstrate how data flows through the product in order to meet their complex needs and deliver the powerful insights and analytics of Jamf Protect. In addition to demand for complete management and security platforms, customers are also reorganizing their infosec and IT departments so that they can manage and secure devices by technology ecosystem. This also allows end users to get the most from all of their devices while organizations can trust solutions built for the unique technology of their environment. Industry analysts, like Omdia are recognizing Jamf for its mobile-first management and security saying Omnia has seen Jamf become the primary UEM solution adopted by businesses that are well invested in the Apple ecosystem.\n\nJamf was also early to market with capabilities to securely manage shared iOS devices. Jamf's management capabilities for iOS and iPad iOS extend well beyond basic device management, including the ability to provision connectivity through eSIM and physical access tokens through key cards stored in digital wallets. This makes Jamf a strong choice for businesses looking to effectively manage and secure their Apple devices. A great example of Jamf's leadership in securely managing iOS devices is a Q4 win Learning Care Group. Learning Care Group is the second largest for-profit child care provider in North America and a leader in early education. It operates over 1,000 schools across 38 states. Learning Care Group will be migrating their 20,000 iOS devices across its locations to Jamf.\n\nWith Jamf, the Company is easily able to manage its entire fleet as well as keep all of the native apps that teachers and children use at school up to date. We continue to see many industries, especially nontraditional tech industries reach for Apple technology then to Jamf to make that tech work for their organization. As I stated earlier, we're seeing strong momentum in professional services, financial services, retail and health care. One example is Sharp Healthcare. Sharp Healthcare is the leading health provider in San Diego in a trailblazer in health care innovation. Their mission is to be the best place to work, the best place to practice medicine and the best place to receive care. One recent innovation is the deployment of more than 1,500 iPads to patient bedside, providing access to their medical records, patient education and entertainment.\n\nThese iPads are powered by Jamf's Healthcare Listener patented technology, which receives patient admit, discharge and transfer messages from the Epic Electronic Health Care System. The technology can automatically trigger management tasks such as remote wipe and full device reset between patients to automatically personalize the experience for each patient while ensuring personal identifiable information and protected health information are secure. Another example of a company reaching for Jamf to power its unique industry-specific workflows is the longest-running airline in India. This customer chose Jamf Pro over their existing management solution and two competitive solutions to manage 5,000 iPads with future plans to implement additional products to achieve trusted access. A modern software engineering team, huddled around their desks, discussing a software solution.\n\nJamf continues to lead the way with continued innovation across our business. One recent Apple innovation that we are particularly excited about is Vision Pro and its potential for the enterprise. Recently, Apple highlighted a number of enterprises that are deploying Vision Pro. This month, we announced we are the first to market with support for Apple Vision Pro, adding this powerful new endpoint to our Apple first security and access products, Jamf Protect and Jamf Connect. This means Jamf customers can now confidently explore new ways of working while maintaining security, performance and privacy. Additionally, with the introduction of MDM support, Provision OS 1.1 beta announced earlier this month by Apple. VisionPro will soon include the key foundations for deploying and leveraging an enterprise-grade device at scale.\n\nJamf will be working alongside Apple to support MDM in Vision Pro, and we are excited to continue to fill the gap between Apple's powerful technology and the security, identity and management needs of the enterprise. As we look ahead to 2024, we will continue to execute our strategy. We are committed to simplifying work by helping organizations succeed with Apple and by doing so at the pace of Apple. To do that, we need to ensure we have a healthy company in service to our stakeholders over the long term. Our business has evolved, both because of continued innovation in the space and because of the changing needs of our customers. Over the last few years, Jamf has been on a dedicated journey to align our workforce to meet the evolving needs of today's IT and security teams while remaining a sustainable and profitable business.\n\nOver the last year, we've seen reduced customer budgets and muted hiring and layoffs in the technology space, which in turn has elongated sales cycles and decreased customer purchases of new devices. This has put pressure on our land and expand strategy. And in Education, K-12 remains in a COVID overhang. These challenges in tech and K-12 will likely remain throughout 2024. On the flip side, we are seeing expansion in industries outside of these two, as I mentioned earlier. We are controlling what we can by transforming and adjusting our investments and resources consistent with our current growth rate. This involves a more rigorous approach than we've taken in the past. We will continue to invest in areas that further solidify Jamf's position as the leading platform for managing and securing Apple at work.\n\nWe remain committed to innovating at the pace of Apple and enhancing our platform to deliver the best solution for our customers today and in the future. We're prioritizing investments in areas where we're seeing tremendous growth and opportunity like security and AI while reducing spend in areas not providing as fast or as high returns. We've also embarked on a number of scalability and efficiency efforts, including realigning our organizational structure to match our investment areas, which resulted in a reduction in force we announced in January. These efforts span every area of our business and were subject to a rigorous process that involves each member of my management team. Ian will provide more detail on the scalability and efficiency efforts in a bit.\n\nAs a result, we are anticipating achieving nearly 700 basis points of non-GAAP operating income margin expansion in 2024 when compared to 2023. We believe this is the right course of action to align Jamf's current revenue growth profile and establish a foundation for success in the future. With that, I'll now turn it over to Ian to review our results and give more color around our 2024 outlook.\n\nIan Goodkind: Thanks, John. We ended Q4 with year-over-year revenue growth of 16%, exceeding the high end of our revenue outlook by $1.6 million. This resulted in fiscal year-over-year revenue growth of 17%. Total ARR reached $588.6 million, representing year-over-year growth of 15%, exceeding expectations. For the first time since Q3 2022 we saw year-over-year new bookings growth, with Q4 representing one of our strongest quarters for commercial new bookings. This helped drive Q4 net new ARR of $22 million, resulting in Jamf's commercial ARR increasing to 74% of Jamf's total ARR and security ARR increasing to 23% of the total. These results benefited from the conversion of Jamf Now customers to Jamf Fundamentals. We continue to believe that Jamf's commercial business and specifically security will be a key growth driver.\n\nSimilar to Q2 and Q3, the strategic core of Jamf's business SaaS recurring revenue remained strong in Q4. Less strategic revenue sources like license, services and on-premise revenues continued to experience year-over-year declines. Additionally, softness in Jamf's two largest industries, tech and K-12 education remained while Jamf's next three largest industries, professional services, financial services and wholesale and retail saw continued momentum. And in addition, Healthcare saw momentum too. Our net retention rate remained flat at 108% in Q4 when compared to Q3. The remainder of my remarks on margins, expense items and profitability will be on a non-GAAP basis. Our GAAP financial results, along with a reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP are found in our earnings release.\n\nQ4 non-GAAP gross profit margin was 82% and within our expectations. We continue to anticipate gross margins in the low 80% range and expect slight fluctuations each quarter. Non-GAAP operating income exceeded the high end of our Q4 outlook at $21.1 million or 14% margin due to increased revenues representing a 700 basis point improvement over Q4 2022. For full year, non-GAAP operating margin was 8%, up 300 basis points increase over fiscal 2022 due to revenue outperformance and cost containment measures. Our trailing 12-month unlevered free cash flow margin was 10% compared to 18% in the prior year. It's important to note that year-over-year decrease in unlevered free cash flow is not indicative of lost customers nor that customers are committing to shorter and lower dollar contracts with us.\n\nIn fact, customers are growing with GAP just not paying their full contract value upfront. Additionally, the trailing 12-month unlevered free cash flow margin of 10% in was slightly lower than expected, primarily related to a shift in customer payments during year-end. Our effective tax rate for Q4 was negative 7% and resulting in a full year effective tax rate of negative 2.1% with both rates consistent with our expectations. As a reminder, for non-GAAP metrics, we use our domestic statutory rate for calculating tax impacts, which is currently 24%. Please note that we pay a negligible amount of cash taxes on a U.S. federal basis and paid an immaterial amount of cash taxes outside the U.S. Now turning to our outlook for 2024. As John discussed, we are aligning investments and resources to match Jamf's current revenue growth profile with a focus on key investment areas and scalability and efficiency initiatives.\n\nNow is the right time to take these measures to set Jamf up for profitable growth in the future and return Jamf to the rule of 40. Some of the scalability and efficiency initiatives include adjusting the sales organization for current and expected growth levels, enhancing the customer journey to make it easier to do business with us, enhancing channel relationships through stronger programs and automation, reducing reliance on steel sales. investing in process improvement and automation in sales and marketing and general administrative, leveraging leadership talent and create more efficient organizational structure and optimizing our global footprint, aligning to where our customers need us most. Most of these initiatives are in process with some same benefits in 2024 and others with benefits expected throughout the next few years.\n\nWith respect to revenue growth, given the subscription nature of our business, softness in device upsell in 2023 will impact our 2024 revenue growth rate. We expect continued pressure on device upsell through 2024. Based on these factors, for the first quarter of 2024, we expect total revenue of $148 million to $150 million, representing year-over-year growth of 12% to 13%. Non-GAAP operating income of $19 million to $20 million, representing a non-GAAP operating income margin of 13% at the midpoint. For the full year 2024, total revenue of $614.5 million to $619.5 million, representing year-over-year growth of 10% at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income of $89 million to $93 million, representing a non-GAAP operating income margin of 15% at the midpoint and a nearly 700 basis point improvement over fiscal year 2023.\n\nWhile we don't provide an outlook for ARR, we would expect to end fiscal year 2024 with ARR growth similar to full year revenue growth. With respect to unlevered free cash flows for full year 2024, we expect unlevered free cash flow margin to be similar to non-GAAP operating income margin. We also provide estimates for amortization, stock-based compensation and related payroll taxes and other metrics to assist with modeling in the earnings presentation as part of the webcast and also posted on our Investor Relations website. As we look beyond 2024, we remain committed to Jamf achieving the Rule of 40. Using our historical calculation method of revenue growth and unlevered free cash flow margin, we anticipate approaching the rule of 40 by the end of 2025.\n\nWe plan to exceed the rule of 40 in 2026. We look forward to sharing more regarding our plans through 2026 as part of our Investor Day on March 13, 2024, at NASDAQ in New York.

(Operator Instructions)\r\n As a reminder, today's program is being recorded.\r\n And now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Jennifer Gaumond, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJennifer Gaumond\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for joining us on today's conference call to discuss Jamf's fourth-quarter and full-year 2023 financial results. With me on today's call are John Strosahl, Chief Executive Officer; and Ian Goodkind, Chief Financial Officer.\r\n Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that shortly after the market closed today, we issued a press release announcing our fourth-quarter and full-year 2023 financial results. We also published the Q4 earnings presentation, investor presentation, and Excel file containing quarterly financial statements to assist with modeling. You may access this information on the Investor Relations section of jamf.com.\r\n Today's discussion may include forward-looking statements. Please refer to our most recent SEC reports, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K where you will see a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements.\r\n I would also like to remind you that during the call, we will discuss some non-GAAP measures related to Jamf's performance. You can find the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures in our earnings release.\r\n Additionally, to ensure we can address as many analyst questions as possible during the call, we ask that you please limit your questions to one initial question and one follow-up.\r\n Now I'd like to turn the call over to John.\n\nStory continues\n\nJohn Strosahl\n\nThanks, Jen. Jamf achieved strong results in Q4 to round out the year, exceeding expectations for the 15th consecutive quarter. Q4 year-over-year revenue growth was 16%, representing the first quarter of revenue growth acceleration since Q2 of 2021.\r\n This strong revenue growth led to our highest non-GAAP operating income quarter ever at $21.1 million, with a non-GAAP operating income margin of 14%. This represents a 700 basis points improvement from Q4 of 2022.\r\n Full-year revenue growth was 17%. ARR grew 15% year over year in 2023 to $588.6 million. Full-year non-GAAP operating income was $45.4 million, a 75% increase over 2022. This resulted in a full-year non-GAAP operating income margins of 8%, a 300 basis points improvement over 2022.\r\n We're especially proud of these strong results as the past six quarters have seen muted growth in the education and tech industries overall, along with slow PC growth. Q4 PC shipments declined nearly 3% with Mac shipment seeing a decline of 18%.\r\n We remain optimistic regarding the potential for a 2024 PC refresh cycle as predicted by IDC. However, our expectations for 2024 are not reliant on a significant uplift in device expansion. Longer term, we're still count in our prediction that Apple technology will become the number-one ecosystem in the enterprise due to continued user preference for Mac at work.\r\n We ended 2023 with 75,300 customers and 32.3 million devices on our platform. Of these customers, 41% run both Jamf management and security product. This represents a significant increase due to the transition of our Jamf Now customers to Jamf Fundamentals. Jamf Fundamentals provides the most complete yet simple IT solution for small- to medium-sized businesses to manage and protect their Apple ecosystem.\r\n Other highlights include continued demand for Jamf's Apple-first security platform with 33% year-over-year growth in security ARR to $134 million or 23% of Jamf's total ARR, our strongest quarter ever for ARR added for Jamf business plan. Many of our largest sales had an upsell component, proving the value of our land-and-expand strategy.\r\n We continue to see positive trends across professional services, financial services, and retail, which are three of the top five industries we serve. And we also saw a strong quarter in healthcare.\r\n Our results were driven by strong performance across our strategic focus areas of Mac leadership, management and security, and Mac and mobile. In Mac leadership, we're seeing continued Mac growth in our customer base with customers like a leading fully integrated biopharmaceutical solutions organization.\r\n The company has been a Jamf customer for nine years. And after finding that their Mac platform required fewer support tickets and a lower total cost of ownership, decided to take the next step and scale out their Mac choice program with Jamf. The company expects to use over 5,000 Macs in the near future as a result of their upcoming refresh cycle.\r\n Moving to the security. Last week, we released our Security 360 report that looks at real-world customer data, cutting-edge threat research, and noteworthy industry events to provide an overview of the evolving threat landscape. Among many striking data points I wanted to highlight, we are now tracking 300 malware families on the Mac operating system. 21 of those families being found in 2023.\r\n It is true that Apple builds one of the most secure out-of-the-box platforms on the market basket. Hackers are agnostic as to the platforms they target. Jamf is the only platform that delivers an Apple-first integrated management and security solution that meets the needs of the modern enterprise.\r\n Jamf enhances Apple's built-in security features by increasing visibility, prevention, controls, and remediation capabilities. We anticipate security to continue to become a larger part of our total ARR over time.\r\n Much of our success in security has been predicated on our ability to deliver both management and security on one platform. The success of Jamf's bundled solution is a testament to this, with ARR growth of bundled solutions outpacing most of Jamf's individual products.\r\n In Q4, over 44% of new customer pipeline generated was for security. Security products are also helping us to increase our win rates. When customers come to Jamf with security in mind, we win almost twice as often as we do when customers are looking at management alone. This was true in both Q3 and Q4 and we expect this trend to continue.\r\n We also see long-term management customers expanding with Jamf with security. In Q4, a European payments company added Jamf Protect with 5,000 Macs as part of a three-year agreement. Given the company's exposure to PII and payment information, it has strict security and regulatory requirements. Our team was able to demonstrate how data flows through the product in order to meet their complex needs and deliver the powerful insights and analytics of Jamf Protect.\r\n In addition to demand for complete management and security platforms, customers are also reorganizing their [influence]-second IT departments so they can manage and secure devices by technology ecosystem. This also allows end users to get the most from all of their devices while organizations can trust solutions built for the unique technology of their environment.\r\n Industry analysts like Omnia are recognizing Jamf for its mobile-first management and security, saying Omnia has seen Jamf become the primary UEM solutions adopted by businesses that are well invested in the Apple ecosystem.\r\n Jamf was also early to market with capabilities to securely manage shared IOS devices. Jamf's management capabilities for IOS and iPad IOS extend well beyond basic device management, including the ability to provision connectivity through e-Sim and physical access tokens through key card stored in digital wallets.\r\n This makes Jamf a strong choice for businesses looking to effectively manage and secure their Apple devices. A great example of Jamf's leadership in securely managing IOS devices in the Q4 win, Learning Care Group. Learning Care Group is the second largest for-profit child care provider in North America and a leader in early education. It operates over 1,000 schools across 38 states.\r\n Learning Care Group will be migrating their 20,000 IOS devices across its locations to Jamf. With Jamf, the company is easily able to manage its entire fleet as well as keep all of the native apps that teachers and children use at school up to date.\r\n We continue to see many industries, especially nontraditional tech industries, reach for Apple technology, then to Jamf to make that tech work for their organization. As I stated earlier, we're seeing strong momentum in professional services, financial services, retail, and healthcare.\r\n One example is Sharp HealthCare. Sharp HealthCare is the leading health provider in San Diego and a trailblazer in healthcare innovation. Their mission is to be the best place to work, the best place to practice medicine, and the best place to receive care.\r\n One recent innovation is the deployment of more than 1,500 iPads to patient bedside, providing access to their medical records, patient education, and entertainment. These iPads are powered by Jamf's healthcare listener, patented technology, which receives patient admit, discharge, and transfer messages from the epic electronic healthcare system.\r\n The technology can automatically trigger management tasks such as remote wipe and full device reset between patients to automatically personalize the experience for each patient, while ensuring personal identifiable information and protected health information are secure.\r\n Another example of a company reaching for Jamf to power its unique industry specific workflows is the longest running airline in India. This customer chose Jamf Pro over their existing management solution and two competitive solutions to manage 5,000 iPads with future plans to implement additional products to achieve trusted access.\r\n Jamf continues to lead the way with continued innovation across our business. One recent Apple innovation that we are particularly excited about is Vision Pro and its potential for the enterprise. Recently, Apple highlighted a number of enterprises that are deploying Vision Pro.\r\n This month, we announced we are the first to market with support for Apple Vision Pro, adding this powerful new endpoint to our Apple-first security and access products, Jamf Protect and Jamf Connect. This means Jamf customers can now confidently explore new ways of working while maintaining security, performance, and privacy.\r\n Additionally, with the introduction of MDM support for Vision OS 1.1 beta announced earlier this month by Apple, Vision Pro will soon include the key foundations for deploying and leveraging an enterprise-grade device at scale. Jamf will be working alongside Apple to support MDM in Vision Pro and we are excited to continue to fill the gap between Apple's powerful technology and the security, identity, and management needs of the enterprise.\r\n As we look ahead into 2024, we will continue to execute our strategy. We are committed to simplify work by helping organizations succeed with Apple, and by doing so, at the pace of Apple. To do that, we need to ensure we have a healthy company in service to our stakeholders over the long term.\r\n Our business has evolved both because of continued innovation in this space and because of the changing needs of our customers. Over the last few years, Jamf has been on a dedicated journey to align our workforce to meet the evolving needs of today's IT and security teams while remaining sustainable and profitable business.\r\n Over the last year, we've seen reduced customer budgets and muted hiring and layoffs in the technology space, which in turn to the elongated sales cycles and decreased customer purchases of new devices. This has put pressure on our land-and-expand strategy. And in education K through 12 remains in a COVID overhang. These challenges in tech and K through 12 will likely remain throughout 2024.\r\n On the flip side, we are seeing expansion in industries outside of these two as I mentioned earlier. We are controlling what we can by transforming and adjusting our investments in resources consistent with our current growth rate. This involves a more rigorous approach that we've taken in the past.\r\n We will continue to invest in areas that further solidify Jamf's position as the leading platform for managing and securing Apple at work. We remain committed to innovating at the pace of Apple and enhancing our platform to deliver the best solution for our customers today and in the future.\r\n We're prioritizing investments in areas where we're seeing tremendous growth and opportunity like security and AI, while reducing spend in areas not providing as fast or as high returns. We've also embarked on a number of scalability and efficiency efforts, including realigning our organizational structure to match our investment areas, which resulted in a reduction in force we announced in January.\r\n These efforts span every area of our business, and we're subject to a rigorous process that involves each member of my management team. Ian will provide more detail on the scalability and efficiency efforts in a bit.\r\n As a result, we are anticipating achieving nearly 700 basis points of non-GAAP operating income margin expansion in 2024 when compared to 2023. We believe this is the right course of action to align Jamf's current revenue growth profile and establish a foundation for success in the future.\r\n With that, I'll now turn it over to Ian to review our results and give more color around our 2024 outlook.\n\nIan Goodkind\n\nThanks, John. We ended Q4 with year-over-year revenue growth of 16%, exceeding the high end of our revenue outlook by $1.6 million. This resulted in fiscal year-over-year revenue growth of 17%.\r\n Total ARR reached $588.6 million, representing year-over-year growth of 15% exceeding expectations. For the first time since Q3 2022, we saw year-over-year new bookings growth with Q4 representing one of our strongest quarters for commercial new bookings.\r\n This helped drive Q4 net new ARR of $22 million, resulting in Jamf's commercial ARR increasing to 74% of Jamf's total ARR and security ARR increasing to 23% of the total. These results benefited from the conversion of Jamf Now customers to Jamf Fundamentals. We continue to believe that Jamf's commercial business, and specifically security, will be a key growth driver.\r\n Similar to Q2 and Q3, the strategic core of Jamf's business, SaaS recurring revenue, remained strong in Q4. Less strategic revenue sources like license, services, and on-premise revenues continued to experience year-over-year declines.\r\n Additionally, softness in Jamf's two largest industries, tech and K through 12 education, remained; while Jamf's next three largest industries, professional services, financial services and wholesale and retail saw continued momentum. And in addition, healthcare saw a momentum, too.\r\n Our net retention rate remained flat at 108% in Q4 when compared to Q3. The remainder of my remarks on margins, expense items, and profitability will be on a non-GAAP basis. Our GAAP financial results, along with a reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP, are found in our earnings release.\r\n Q4 non-GAAP gross profit margin was 82% and within our expectations. We continue to anticipate gross margins in the low-80% range and expect slight fluctuations each quarter. Non-GAAP operating income exceeded the high end of our Q4 outlook at $21.1 million or 14% margin due to increased revenues, representing a 700 basis point improvement over Q4 2022.\r\n For full year, non-GAAP operating margin was 8%, a 300 basis point increase over fiscal 2022 due to revenue outperformance and cost containment measures. Our trailing 12-months unlevered free cash flow margin was 10% compared to 18% in the prior year. It's important to note that year-over-year decrease in unlevered free cash flow is not indicative of lost customers nor that customers are committing shorter and lower dollar contracts with us. In fact, customers are growing with Jamf just not paying their full contract value upfront.\r\n Additionally, the trailing 12 months unlevered free cash flow margin of 10% was slightly lower than expected, primarily related to a shift in customer payments during year end. Our effective tax rate for Q4 was negative 7%, resulting in a full-year effective tax rate of negative 2.1%, with both rates consistent with our expectations.\r\n As a reminder, for non-GAAP metrics, we use our domestic statutory rates for calculating tax impacts, which is currently 24%. Please note that we pay a negligible amount of cash taxes on a US federal basis and pay an immaterial amount of cash taxes outside the US.\r\n Now turning to our outlook for 2024. As John discussed, we are aligning investments and resources to match Jamf's current revenue growth profile with a focus on key investment areas and scalability and efficiency initiatives. Now is the right time to take these measures to set Jamf up for profitable growth in the future.\r\n Some of the scalability and efficiency initiatives include: adjusting the sales organization for current and expected growth levels; enhancing the customer journey to make it easier to do business with us; enhancing channel relationships through stronger programs and automation, reducing reliance on field sales; investing in process improvement and automation in sales and marketing and general and administrative; leveraging leadership talent and create more efficient organizational structures; and optimizing our global footprint, aligning to where our customers need us most.\r\n Most of these initiatives are in process with some seeing benefits in 2024 and others with benefits expected throughout the next few years.\r\n With respect to revenue growth, given the subscription nature of our business, softness in device upsell in 2023 will impact our 2024 revenue growth rate. We expect continued pressure on device upsell through 2024.\r\n Based on these factors, for the first quarter of 2024, we expect total revenue of $148 million to $150 million, representing year-over-year growth of 12% to 13%. Non-GAAP operating income of $19 million to $20 million, representing a non-GAAP operating income margin of 13% at the midpoint.\r\n For the full-year 2024, total revenue of $614.5 to $619 million, representing year-over-year growth of 10% at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income of $89 million to $93 million, representing a non-GAAP operating income margin of 15% at midpoint and a nearly 700 basis point improvement over fiscal year 2023.\r\n While we don't provide an outlook for ARR, we would expect to end fiscal year 2024 with ARR growth similar to full-year revenue growth. With respect to unlevered free cash flow for full-year 2024, we expect unlevered free cash flow margin to be similar to non-GAAP operating income margin.\r\n We also provide estimates for amortization, stock-based compensation, and related payroll taxes, and other metrics to assist with modeling in the earnings presentation as part of the webcast and also posted on our Investor Relations website.\r\n As we look beyond 2024, we remain committed to Jamf achieving the Rule of 40. Using our historical calculation method of revenue growth and unlevered free cash flow margin, we anticipate approaching the Rule of 40 by the end of 2025. We plan to exceed the Rule of 40 in 2026.\r\n We look forward to sharing more regarding our plans through 2026 as part of our Investor Day on March 13, 2024, at Nasdaq in New York. If you would like to attend in person or virtually and have yet to register, please reach out to investorevents@jamf.com.\r\n And now John and I will take your questions. Operator?\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions)\r\n Joshua Reilly, Needham & Company.\n\nJoshua Reilly\n\nAll right. Thanks for taking my questions. Starting off on the macro here. Tech obviously remains a headwind. Maybe some color, were the Q4 renewal consistent with your expectations entering the quarter? And then overall with tech incrementally weaker than what you expected entering the quarter as well?\n\nJohn Strosahl\n\nHey, Josh, this is John. As part of Q4 renewals, no, that was in line with what we had expected, hadn't anticipated. And we're pretty happy with the Q4 performance, especially as it ended the year.\r\n And as far as the tax weakness, we just haven't seen the hiring resume in tech yet. We anticipate that's going to come along with IDC and everyone else, but we haven't seen it yet. And we also haven't contemplated in our guidance either.\n\nJoshua Reilly\n\nGot it. That's helpful. And then just one follow-up. If you look at the guidance for 2024, can you just help us understand, are you also assuming working on a conservative assumption around new customer activity as well? And are you planning for more contracts or renewals with device down-sell in these assumptions? Thank you.\n\nJohn Strosahl\n\nYeah. Thanks, Josh. We build our guidance using a bottoms-up approach. And in 2024, we're factoring in the same muted economics that we saw in 2023. Also, impacting our revenue growth rates in 2024 is the reduced upsell in 2023 because we are a high recurring revenue business.\r\n And as we just talked about or you alluded to, 46% of our ARR does come from information communication, i.e., tech, which has the reduced customer hiring practices. And EDU still have the COVID overhang.\r\n On the new logos specifically, we are factoring in assumptions similar to 2023. In addition, on the less strategic choppy revenue sources, we have those factor in a slightly lower level than what we saw in 2023.\r\n But we are focused on all things we can control. We're focused on the cross-sell opportunities. We're focus on security and selling into mobile. And the thing we haven't factored in is if the upsell return, that would be something that would drive that number higher in the form of customers, hiring more employees. It would come back in the form of more refresh programs within 2024 and choice programs with that (inaudible) and on the education side and then the replacement market being even stronger than we've anticipated.\n\nJoshua Reilly\n\nGot it. Very helpful. Thank you, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nRob Owens, Piper.\n\nRob Owens\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking my question. And I guess just around some of those dynamics, you stated net retention rate of 108%, which I believe was flat quarter over quarter. First part, can you just remind us of the calculation of that at that point in time versus trailing 12 months?\r\n And second, as we contemplate 2024, what are your expectations there given some of the turnover issues? I think we're seeing in high-tech and not seeing the upsell that you were likely in the last couple of years. Thanks.\n\nIan Goodkind\n\nHey, Rob, I'll jump in on that question. So you're correct that our net retention rates didn't change from Q3 to Q4. Remain that one way. And as a reminder to your question, it is based on a trailing 12-month measure.\r\n What we are looking forward to based on the guidance that we just provided is that the net retention rate will trickle down throughout the year by about 100 basis points per quarter. But we do believe that actually bottoms out at the end of the year and stabilizes from our cross-sell efforts. And as the macro turn, then as we get better and better, which we are, we have gotten really good at selling security, those will go well and will accelerate that number upward.\n\nRob Owens\n\nThank you much.\n\nOperator\n\nGregg Moskowitz, Mizuho.\n\nGregg Moskowitz\n\nHey, thank you for taking the questions. Good afternoon, guys. I guess first question, can you expand on your latest thoughts on PC and Mac refresh activity in 2024?\r\n I think we all have seen what IDC is saying. I'm wondering if you have any additional perspective from your conversations with customers. And then also what sort of assumptions around refresh are baked into this revenue guide for the full year?\n\nJohn Strosahl\n\nHey, Greg, I'll take the first part of that question and then Ian can expand on expectations. With respect to the PC refresh and speaking with our customers, they're just being prudent in their expense management as well. And they're just looking out into the out years, looking at what their hiring practices are. And they're just -- they're not -- we're not seeing a great anticipation (technical difficulty) But again, we're seeing the budget management. We're seeing on platform consolidation, and that's kind of how we set our guidance accordingly in '24.\r\n Ian, do you got something more?\n\nIan Goodkind\n\nYes. What I'll add on that refresh program within 2024, we are factoring the same economics we saw in 2023. So we saw that lack of upsell of device expansion in 2023. So we're factoring in that same muted upsell at renewal.\r\n But if that comes back, we see that as a good opportunity for us as choice programs come into play. We do note in that IDC article and other places and other checks that we've heard is an opportunity next year for refresh cycle. So that is something we think could be a tailwind for us next year.\n\nGregg Moskowitz\n\nPerfect. Thanks, Ian. Just as a follow-up, you mentioned, John, that you saw benefit from Jamf Now conversions to Jamf Fundamentals. Are you able to put a finer point perhaps on how this is impacting the business today as well as how it may help in 2024 and beyond? Thank you.\n\nJohn Strosahl\n\nYes, I can certainly speak to what the customer is seeing from the benefit. And then Ian can follow up with some with some numbers, if needed. You know, really we've seen a tremendous value. Our customers have seen a tremendous value with the security and the management being part of the same product. In fact, when we go to market with security and management, we win almost twice as many times as we just are talking about security on its own.\r\n And we also have a greater stickiness when those customers are using our using both our management and security products together. And so this was really something our customers have asked for with respect to the security side. And so we wanted to make sure that we had that bundled solution for those customers. And there's been a great benefit.\r\n We've done that a few months ago. And we haven't really seen any negative pushback or attrition from that as a result. So we're getting good feedback from our customers.\n\nIan Goodkind\n\nYes, I would just add some number of points to that. Out of the net new ARR of $22 million, the impact was about $6 million. We haven't seen any material changes in churn there. So customers are loving it and accepting it. And we are seeing success in our other bundles.\r\n And just to quote to other stats there, one, we see 79% growth year over year when combining both our business plan and enterprise plan. And in the fourth quarter alone, Jamf business plan had the most successful quarter in the form of net new ARR.\n\nGregg Moskowitz\n\nVery helpful. Thank you, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nDJ Hynes, Canaccord Genuity.\n\nHey, guys, this is Ryan on for DJ. So I just wanted to double click on some of the go-to-market motions you're building out, I guess, particularly the self-directed and the partner-led motions we've spoken about before. Can you just elaborate on any traction you're seeing there? And I guess, like when we'd start to see any of that progress reflected in S&M as we progress through 2024?\n\nJohn Strosahl\n\nOkay, Ryan, this is John here. So I've got two parts of that question. One is how the go-to-market has been optimized through self-directed; and the other is through our partner. We would classify that as our third-party channel as well as our strategic partnerships.\r\n And with respect to the first one, the self-directed, that's really what the investment opportunity or investments that we have done in our systems to gain some efficiencies there that we'll see primarily toward the back half of the year.\r\n And those are things like the partner portal. When partners can come in and actually put data directly into the portal and make their own quotes. It's also buying product from within the product, whether that's additional seats on their renewal or additional products from within our product. And those are all things that we're putting into place from a technological investment.\r\n With respect to our third-party channel, we've actually increased the amount of business going through that third-party channel on a global basis. We've always run primarily channel led outside the US and in the US, that's becoming even more so, and in fact, increasing in its percentage there.\r\n And we're going to continue to do that. Some of the optimizations that we've done in our go-to-market teams just early even this year are really focused on that, leveraging more in the channel, which we've talked about for some time. And that's actually coming to fruition. And we're seeing that in the percentage of our business going through our channel partners.\n\nOkay. Awesome. Great to hear. And then I guess just a quick follow-up. I know you have your Investor Day coming up in a couple of weeks. But when you talk about meeting the Rule of 40 by the end of 2025 and exceeding it in 2026, can you help me think about like what are your expectations there between the balance of growth and profitability?\n\nIan Goodkind\n\nYes, I can talk to that. So we would expect our revenue to be a higher growth rate in '25 and '26 than what we see in 2024 for all the reasons of the tailwinds that we mentioned that we haven't factored into 2024. With 2025 and 2026 profitability, we would expect that to expand as well.\r\n As we talked about, we have certain initiatives to make the customer journey easier. We have certain back-office automation, and both those will provide benefits in '25 and '26. And as a last reminder I make here is you'll hear more specifics on that at our Investor Day on March 13 at Nasdaq in New York.\n\nOkay. Awesome. Thanks. Appreciate the time.\n\nOperator\n\nJake Roberge, William Blair.\n\nJake Roberge\n\nHey. Thanks for taking the questions. I know it's hard to predict when hiring really starts to ramp more meaningfully. But as you look into 2024, should we expect the headwinds in tech and education to trough this year? Or does that dynamic that we'll still have to kind of deal with and work through in 2025 as you work through some of the longer renewal cycles from potentially larger tech customers and education customers? Just curious how those renewal cycles are shaping up heading into next year.\n\nJohn Strosahl\n\nYes, Jake. This is John. We, along with a lot of the market, had anticipated the tech hiring to resume in 2023 or the back half of '23. But we didn't see that. And so really taking that into consideration, we wanted to have a balanced approach going into our 2024 guidance, which is what we see here.\r\n So we're going to continue to run a balanced growth profile with investing in growth as well while maintaining profitability in the meantime.\n\nIan Goodkind\n\nOne thing I'd add, as we look at our, let's say, top five industries, so we talked about tech and education, we are actually seeing continued strength in the next three pieces or industries. So professional services, financial services, and retail and wholesale. And those have provided a really good strength and growth rate for us. And we're really excited about the opportunities in those segments.\r\n And the last thing I'd mention here is as we've talked about non-tech leading important industries have really been looking at that flip use of our products, and that has been a success story for us as well.\n\nJake Roberge\n\nOkay. Very helpful. And then really nice growth in the security suite this quarter. Now that you're hitting a more meaningful scale there, how should we think about a durable growth rate in that segment?\r\n And then just kind of on the other side of that coin, do you expect to see similar headwinds in the security business in 2024 as you see on the device management side? Or could that actually be more insulated heading into next year?\n\nIan Goodkind\n\nYes. On the security side, look, we have a business that grew 33% year over year. It now represents 23% of our total ARR. We continue to think that's a really strong focus point for us that we've allocated resources that way. And we think that can continue to be a very strong rate -- growth rate in the future.\r\n I would say that we are going to provide more details around that at our Investor Day. But what we are seeing and it goes back to our bundles discussion before, when we are combining management and security, it has been a very successful win rate. And we actually are seeing customers stay a little bit more sticky and are happier when we combine those products together.\n\nJohn Strosahl\n\nAnd Jake, I'll just add to that as well. I mean speaking to our customers, they're certainly not investing less in security. And as our customers will come back to us and talk about Apple's specific functionality that we have, that's really been a benefit.\r\n And when you combine that with the management piece, not only can you identify the threat, but you can also do something about it and actually deploy that, that's really what we've seen. So we're continuing to be optimistic about the management and security piece together and how that resonates with our customer base.\n\nJake Roberge\n\nSounds great. Thank you for taking the questions.\n\nOperator\n\nMatt Hedberg, RBC.\n\nMatthew Hedberg\n\nGreat, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. John, have you noticed anything competitively, maybe an increased pipeline or anything of that from VM or AirWatch, just kind of given the ongoing acquisition there by Broadcom? And just sort of want to competitively, is there anything there maybe improving a bit?\n\nJohn Strosahl\n\nYes. Thanks, Matt. It certainly has. We've been working on this for quite a while. And while we are really optimistic about that replacement opportunity, it's not going to happen all at once, just given those customers have multiyear contracts. And we're really tied into that customer base.\r\n And so when those renewals come up, we're certainly showing the advantage of not only the management security together, but then an Apple-led and Apple-focused ecosystem support. And that again, is resonating with our customer base. So we continue to remain optimistic about that. And now with the recent events that have transpired over the last few days, we were even just as, if not even more optimistic about it.\n\nMatthew Hedberg\n\nGot it. And that's great. There's a lot of good commentary specifically what you guys are doing to maybe offset some of the tougher spending that you're seeing, other device adds, headcount growth, et cetera. But I still reflect on the opportunity still seems like such a greenfield opportunity as it stands.\r\n Are there things from either strategic marketing or targeting greenfield accounts through like ROI-based selling that can drive sort of up above Jamf growth above market trends? Maybe from -- just trying to go after what feels like a really, really greenfield opportunity still?\n\nJohn Strosahl\n\nYes, there's all of the above. I mean, we're certainly doing all the account base. We're doing all the analytics and making sure that we target the accounts that are available. And with what we mentioned earlier, just with budgets being a rather muted this year in anticipation of tech hiring and the refresh cycle in education, we're certainly poised for that.\r\n We've done a lot of the market research, and we've had some elongated sales cycles like many of us in the industry have. But again, the opportunity is there. We've got great win rates, especially when we put management and security together. We'll just keep doubling down on those things that have been successful and open up new areas where they become available. And the replacement market is just one.\r\n Ian mentioned earlier about the desk lists workflows and industry workflows that we're seeing with all the other additional devices that are coming out from Apple and the ones that are out now just being put into process in a lot of different functions in ways that we hadn't anticipated before. And that's also something that we're really focused on and working with our channel partners to really optimize and take advantage of that opportunity.\n\nMatthew Hedberg\n\nGreat. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nRaimo Lenschow, Barclays.\n\nHey, this is Isaac on for Raimo. Thanks for taking the question. John, you've talked about enterprise being a bit more resilient than SMB over the last couple of quarters. And I was wondering if there was anything to call out here, whether to the benefit of enterprise again or the weakness of SMB.\n\nJohn Strosahl\n\nYes, thanks, Isaac. We've seen -- when we talk about the volatility in the SMB, as markets uncertainty, you have small businesses that can go out of business or get bought. There a lot of reasons for them, that volatility to have nothing to do with the products that they're using necessarily. So we've seen some there, but I don't think any more than the industry on average.\r\n We have -- two-thirds of our business is volume base, small-to-medium size. But we have a good chunk of that business and enterprise. And we've seen the scalability that we provide over -- doing this for over 20 years alongside Apple that has really, really resonated with our customers.\r\n In fact, when we get into the enterprise, the higher we get up, generally the less competition we have, especially as it relates to the Apple -- as it relates to the Apple ecosystem. So they're good benefits in the enterprise.\r\n We saw Q4 finished strong. We saw companies that had budget the end of the quarter that went ahead and pulled the trigger on that. And we've seen some good progress earlier this year, even with the enterprise groups.\n\nGreat. That's really helpful. And then one for Ian. On cash flow, you talked again about the shift from upfront to annual billings. Was the level there similar to last quarter? Should we think about that being a bit more predominant now in the customer base? And then as we look into FY24, should we expect that shift to move back to upfront or to the end of the year?\n\nIan Goodkind\n\nYes. Just to clarify a couple of things there. So when comparing '23 to '22, the primary driver was that shift in multiyear being -- that used to be paid upfront to annually paid. That was the primary driver. Within the quarter itself, we actually saw our customers just defer payments to basically January of '24. So it was just a timing issue, not indicative of our business. Neither of those are.\r\n As we roll forward, I would say operating income or margin is the bigger driver of our unlevered free cash flows as we move forward. And we just raised our operating income about 700 basis points. And we've said that unlevered free cash flow is going to be about consistent with that. And that has factored in all the changes in customer payment behaviors.\n\nAll right, great. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nChad Bennett, Craig Hallum.\n\nChad Bennett\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking my questions and fitting me in. So Ian maybe, just in terms of how we should think about both device growth and ARR per device relative to your revenue growth guidance, is there any type of correlation there? And how should we think about those two metrics?\n\nIan Goodkind\n\nYes. I would call your attention back to our growth algorithm. We have new logos. We have upsell, device expansion, and we have cross-sell. And we are going to continue to focus on those things that we can control, which is cross-sell specifically.\r\n We are factoring in the same upsell, muted upsells at renewal. But we are definitely focused on the successes we've had and seeing customers see the value in both management and security. That is where we're going to drive, and specifically, in the bundles because we think that's what drives the most customer value.\n\nChad Bennett\n\nAnd then maybe one quick follow-up for John. Just kind of a follow-up on the competitive question, I guess, a couple of questions ago. Just specific to the endpoint security market and protect. And obviously that product is still growing nicely. Is there any kind of new revelations there just competitively now that you're another quarter and year into that product and into that endpoint security market that you'd like to share?\n\nJohn Strosahl\n\nYes. I mean, you're right, Protect has done really well and we're very happy about that. In fact, in security in general, 44% of our pipeline was security. So we're really seeing to get traction there.\r\n With Protect, we continue to add functionality to it. We're going to continue to add more pieces of security as our customers' requests that. And yes, I mean, that's pretty much all we have to do with Protect. It's done well. Our reps are becoming even more well versed in selling that, especially as it relates to in conjunction with security. And we're going to continue to double down on that.\n\nChad Bennett\n\nGot it. Thanks much.\n\nOperator\n\nPat Walravens, JMP.\n\nPat Walravens\n\nGreat. Thank you. I think, John, usually companies guide revenue below where expectations are after they've had a disappointing bookings or a renewal quarter. But in your case, it sounds like bookings and renewals in Q4 were actually pretty good. So when did you guys decide it was time to increase the profitability to align with the current growth profile, as you worded it in the press release?\n\nJohn Strosahl\n\nThanks, Pat. Good question. No. We understand that. And what we're really trying to do is have a balanced approach to profitability and growth going into 2024. And as I mentioned earlier, we, as the rest of the market, expected that returned to come in mid even until late '25 -- or '23, and that didn't happen. So we're just trying to be judicious in our approach in our guidance in '24.\r\n As Ian mentioned, there are things that could impact that in 2024. The tech hiring could resume. We expect that there's going to be an EDU refresh. But we haven't anticipated that in our guidance because the market hasn't behaved like we thought it was going to in '23.\r\n And so we're just making sure that we're doing the right thing for the business and our customers long term. And that's making sure that we're optimized for efficiency and scalability as we go into '24. But we are well placed to be able to scale up when those growth vectors continue or start to resume. And we're watching that very, very closely. So we're on point.\n\nPat Walravens\n\nOkay, great. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nKoji Ikeda, Bank of America Securities.\n\nKoji Ikeda\n\nYes. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. There's a couple from me here. First one, maybe a question for John or Ian. What do you view as the most attractive levers to drive upside to growth in 2024?\n\nJohn Strosahl\n\nYes. I'll take that one, Koji. So our most attractive levers, we have many of them. We really do. I mean, certainly the replacement market. Absence of the tech hiring resuming and the ED refresh and those things we've already talked about, but certainly the replacement market as it becomes more apparent. And again, the events of the last few days have continued our optimism in that as we really lean into those customers and show the value of management and security together, especially at scale and focused on Apple first and Apple best. So those are the areas that we really see.\r\n International is a great opportunity for us. We saw some softness in international in the middle of the year in '23. We saw that tick up towards the end of the year. We continue to see that at the beginning of this year.\r\n So as Apple mentioned on their earnings call that they've had some success internationally as well. We work very closely with Apple outside the US and in the US but certainly outside the US. And so we're continuing to leverage that as we expand internationally. So those would be some of the biggest areas.\r\n And then I guess to wrap it up would be security. I mean, every device can have one device management product on it. But every device can have five or six or more security products on it. And IT and infosec teams generally do that. They want belt and suspenders on security. And then when we offer something that's Apple specific along with the management fees, that gives us a good opportunity and really a lever to increase.\n\nKoji Ikeda\n\nYes. Got it. That's super helpful. And maybe following up to Pat's question, just booking sounds good. So what sort of triggers are you looking for as maybe a signal that it's time to invest at a greater rate than what the plan is currently set for?\n\nJohn Strosahl\n\nWe've seen close ratios while sales cycles have been elongated. We've seen close ratios maintained pretty similar. We measure our go-to-market organization with a very disciplined and rigorous approach. Our cadence is very, very tight on that.\r\n And so we can get those leading indicators and shift accordingly. So we know that sales cycle is starting to drop. We know if that conversion rate is starting to go higher. We know when the ASPs of each one of those deals in the pipeline are starting to raise. Any one of those indicators are going to lead us to really lean in to that and to invest in that growth. And also geographically, to the extent that we've seen international continue to take the momentum up, we're going to look at that and invest in that area as well.\n\nIan Goodkind\n\nI would just add one thing on our operating income guidance there at a midpoint of 15%, we are committed. To John's point, we have optimized our organization and made it so we can commit -- continue to commit to that 15%.\n\nKoji Ikeda\n\nThanks, guys.

For the first time, there\u2019s a race brewing for an outsider to join their ranks.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nApple to Wind Down Electric Car Effort After Decadelong Odyssey How Much Wealth You Need to Join the Richest 1% Around the World Office Tower Deal for $1 Reveals Anxiety Among Longtime Buyers A Spike in Heart Disease Deaths Since Covid Is Puzzling Scientists Apple's Scrapped Car Project Means AI and Headset Bets Are More Urgent\n\nRallies since the start of the year in Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. \u2014 which has its hands in businesses ranging from Dairy Queen to Fruit of the Loom \u2014 and weight-loss drug darling Eli Lilly & Co. have the two jockeying for a spot in that top echelon of S&P 500 stocks. The two firms couldn\u2019t be more different \u2014 from each other and the tech giants they\u2019re chasing.\n\nThe Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate has slowly but steadily marched upward to command a market valuation of nearly $900 billion. In contrast, the world\u2019s largest drugmaker has momentum on its side after rapidly tripling in value over the past two years. A recent paradigm shift in how the world treats obesity has left Lilly\u2019s value standing at more than $700 billion.\n\nAs Wall Street obsesses over the narrow breadth of the stock market\u2019s ascent, the two firms provide a key foil for the so-called Magnificent Seven which have held sway over the market. Fascination with the tech giants has juiced their valuations and shot the S&P 500 well ahead of an equal-weighted version of the benchmark that dilutes the megacaps\u2019 impact, leaving investors searching for fresh narratives outside of all things artificial intelligence-related.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got two other companies besides the tech names that are exciting to talk about,\u201d said Matt Orton, chief market strategist at Raymond James Investment Management. \u201cIt gets the conversation started that there\u2019s a lot working within the market besides megacap tech.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s generally a good thing \u2014 to highlight that there is in fact non-tech breadth out there,\u201d he added.\n\nTortoise vs Hare\n\nBerkshire and Lilly have taken very different paths to their current valuations, climbing roughly 15% and 59% last year, respectively. While Buffett\u2019s firm reported growing operating earnings from its medley of insurance, energy, railroad and other businesses, Lilly has skyrocketed on hopes for demand for its blockbuster weight-loss drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound.\n\nIf either stock were to replicate its 2023 gains in the months ahead, they would surpass a market capitalization of $1 trillion, joining the ranks of tech giants including Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Nvidia Corp.\n\nSuch returns are never guaranteed, not even for the Oracle of Omaha, who reminded investors of that recently.\n\n\u201cAll in all, we have no possibility of eye-popping performance,\u201d Buffett wrote in his annual letter to shareholders over the weekend, cautioning that the company\u2019s size constrains its ability to make needle-moving deals.\n\nStill, a deal could be one catalyst for the stock. \u201cIf it\u2019s seen by the market as a smart play \u2014 which Warren Buffett typically does \u2014 they could make that bounce over the trillion-dollar goal line,\u201d said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial.\n\nMeanwhile, optimism about Lilly\u2019s prospects rose at Morgan Stanley where earlier this month analysts lifted their price target to $950 on the drugmaker, the highest on the Street. The bank\u2019s analysts speculated on if Lilly would become the first trillion-dollar biopharmaceutical company, signaling there\u2019s room for the stock to run higher.\n\nConsensus still implies a long road for Lilly to hit the $1 trillion milestone. Analysts tracked by Bloomberg have an average price target of $777 on Lilly, putting it at a less than $750 billion valuation over the next year, according to Bloomberg calculations.\n\nSky High\n\nLilly\u2019s valuation premium may be behind Wall Street\u2019s skepticism. The stock currently trades above its five-year average at about 57 times forward earnings, far higher than that of the front-runner of the AI revolution, Nvidia, or any of the other names in the Magnificent Seven with the exception of Tesla Inc. Meanwhile, Berkshire trades below most of the group on a price-to-earnings basis.\n\nCrossing the Line\n\nIn the US, tech giants have long ruled the thirteen-digit ranks. Apple first broke the ceiling in 2018. Microsoft recently eclipsed the $3 trillion mark and currently commands the highest market capitalization in the S&P 500.\n\nNvidia has been flirting with the $2 trillion mark, while Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. all trade above a $1 trillion valuation. Tesla joined the club\u2019s elite ranks amid its feverish 2021 rally, but has since dropped out \u2014 a warning to future new conscripts.\n\n\u201cWhen valuations become richer and richer, it doesn\u2019t matter which company it is, which sector, the market becomes much more discerning and therefore more critical \u2014 and demanding more positive guidance during the earnings season,\u201d said LPL\u2019s Krosby.\n\nThe promise of new markets for its weight-loss treatments \u2014 ranging from heart failure to sleep apnea \u2014 is a likely factor in propelling Lilly toward the one trillion milestone, according to Shams Afzal, a portfolio manager at Carnegie Investment Counsel.\n\n\u201cLilly has truly become the unicorn in the space,\u201d Afzal said. \u201cIt may not touch a trillion dollars this year, but the milestone is not an improbable one.\u201d\n\nIf Berkshire breaks into $1 trillion territory, it will be in part due to the success of one of the tech giants it\u2019s chasing: Apple is the top holding in the firm\u2019s stocks portfolio after Buffett amassed a roughly $165 billion stake. Last year\u2019s 48% rally in Apple shares bolstered that position.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nElon Musk\u2019s Vegas Tunnel Project Has Been Racking Up Safety Violations Hong Kong\u2019s Hottest New Store Is the Costco in Shenzhen There\u2019s One Musk Endeavor That\u2019s Not Doing So Great China\u2019s Piano Dreams Are Fading for a Cash-Strapped Middle Class Transcript: Did Musk Buy Twitter to Keep His Movements Secret?\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/berkshire-lilly-race-shake-tech-123852089.html", "symbols": ["0R2V.IL", "AAPL.BA", "AAPL.MX", "AAPL.NEO", "AAPL.SN", "AAPL.US", "AAPL34.SA", "APC.BE", "APC.DU", "APC.F", "APC.HA", "APC.HM", "APC.MU", "APC.STU", "APC.XETRA", "APC8.F", "BERK34.SA", "BRH.BE", "BRH.DU", "BRH.F"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.999, "neg": 0.033, "neu": 0.841, "pos": 0.126}}, {"date": "2024-02-28T12:30:19+00:00", "title": "Dow Jones Futures Fall But Stock Market Showing Healthy Action; Apple Shifts To AI", "content": "The major indexes are taking it easy as small caps lead, a healthy mix.

He was born in 1930 and bought his first stock at age 11. By 1965, he was running his own investment company, Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B).\n\nBuffett remains at the helm of Berkshire today. It has amassed an expansive portfolio that includes several wholly owned private companies, and 47 publicly traded stocks and securities.\n\nBerkshire's largest holding is Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), which became the world's first $1 trillion company in 2018. That rare milestone has since been achieved by five other technology giants: Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), Nvidia, and Meta Platforms.\n\nBerkshire could be the first U.S. company outside the tech sector to join the $1 trillion club. Its stock has delivered a mammoth 4,384,748% gain since 1965, carrying the company to a valuation of almost $900 billion. Here's why it could cross the trillion-dollar milestone as soon as this year. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nBuffett's investing strategy is simple\n\nBuffett is all about value investing. He likes to buy great businesses at a fair price -- though the cheaper the better -- with the intention of holding on to them for the long term. He looks for companies generating a steady profit, combined with consistent revenue growth and strong management teams. He especially likes companies that return money to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks.\n\nBuffett's most powerful weapon is time. He's a big advocate for compound interest, which is responsible for building most of his wealth. For example, Berkshire spent $1.3 billion accumulating shares of Coca-Cola between 1988 and 1994. Today, that position is worth $24.4 billion -- but it also paid Berkshire $736 million in dividends in 2023.\n\nIn other words, Berkshire recoups its initial Coca-Cola investment in dividends alone every two years. But that's just one of the conglomerate's many success stories.\n\nStory continues\n\nBerkshire's portfolio is filled with high-quality businesses\n\nBerkshire was a textiles company on the brink of failure before Buffett stepped in and bought it in 1965. He quickly realized its core business was no longer viable, so he transformed it into a holding company to house various investments.\n\nBerkshire now has a full ownership stake in a number of famous businesses including Dairy Queen, Duracell, and GEICO. Plus, its portfolio of publicly traded stocks and securities is worth $371.9 billion, a sizable portion of which is attributable to one stock: Apple.\n\nBerkshire first bought Apple stock in 2016 and it has steadily increased the size of its position over time, spending around $38 billion in total. That single holding is worth $165.3 billion as of this writing, accounting for 44% of the total value of Berkshire's portfolio of publicly traded securities.\n\nBank of America and American Express are Berkshire's second- and third-largest holdings, respectively. Last year, Berkshire received more than $2.1 billion in dividends from its top three positions alone.\n\nBerkshire owns smaller positions in energy companies like Chevron and Occidental Petroleum. Plus, if owning American Express wasn't enough, its portfolio also includes the two other major credit card companies, Visa and Mastercard.\n\nWhile Buffett is known to avoid most technology stocks, Berkshire has accumulated small positions in Amazon and cloud computing company Snowflake.\n\nBerkshire's market-crushing returns are the result of incredible financial growth\n\nAs I touched on at the top, Berkshire stock has delivered a whopping 4,384,748% gain since 1965, or 19.8% compounded annually. That trounces the 31,223% gain in the benchmark S&P 500 index over the same period, which translates to just 10.2% compounded annually.\n\nThe difference is staggering in dollar terms. A mere $1,000 invested in Berkshire stock in 1965 would be worth $48.4 million today. The same investment in the S&P 500 would be worth just $313,230.\n\nThe conglomerate has the financial results to back up those substantial gains. It generated $49.3 million in revenue in 1965, and in 2023, that number was a record-high $364.4 billion. Over $155.6 billion came from sales and services across the various businesses under Berkshire's umbrella, with a further $83.4 billion coming from its insurance businesses. Its railroad, utility, and energy interests contributed $101.4 billion.\n\nBerkshire also delivered a record profit last year, with a net income of $96.2 billion. That compares to just $2.3 million in net income in 1965.\n\nBerkshire could join the $1 trillion club in 2024\n\nWith a market capitalization of almost $900 billion as of this writing, Berkshire stock only needs a gain of about 11% from here to cross the $1 trillion milestone. Considering its 58-year track record of delivering 19.8% annual returns, on average, it appears sure to get there in 2024.\n\nA number of factors will probably work in the conglomerate's favor as the year progresses. The stock market is at an all-time high right now, and most Wall Street analysts predict it will continue to move higher. Plus, Berkshire could earn record dividends in 2024 because companies like Apple, Coca-Cola, and American Express continue to increase their payouts.\n\nIn the broader economy, the U.S. Federal Reserve estimates it will cut interest rates three times in 2024, which will serve as a tailwind for Berkshire's consumer-focused businesses. Its transport and logistics businesses would also benefit if rate cuts drive more economic activity.\n\nFinally, Buffett continues to believe in the conglomerate's prospects because he authorized the repurchase of almost $9.2 billion worth of Berkshire's shares in 2023. Buffett has overseen $73.6 billion worth of share repurchases during the last five years alone, which is more than he has deployed into any other stock.\n\nBuffett recently told investors that Berkshire's enormous size will prevent it from generating \"eye-popping performance\" in the future, but based on its share repurchases, it's clear he still feels Berkshire stock is the best bet he can make in the world.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Berkshire Hathaway wasn\u2019t one of them.

These 5 Dividend Stocks Offer Fantastic Passive Income to Help You on Your Way.", "content": "Financial freedom is a beautiful goal and the reason many people invest. Being able to work because you want to, not because you have to, is the ultimate flex. You can take different roads and get to the same place, but dividend stocks are an excellent path for this journey.\n\nDividend stocks are shares of companies that share their profits with you. Own enough of them, and the dividends might even cover your living expenses without you having to sell shares to raise money.\n\nConsider adding these five fantastic stocks to your portfolio if you want dividend-driven financial freedom.\n\nThey have the goods to pay you ever-increasing dividends for the foreseeable future.\n\n1. A real estate stock yielding 5.8%\n\nRealty Income(NYSE: O) is a real estate investment trust (REIT): a company that leases real estate it owns and pays at least 90% of its taxable income to shareholders as dividends. A REIT allows investors to benefit from real estate profits without owning properties.\n\nRealty Income focuses on single-tenant retail properties, including grocery stores, convenience stores, dollar stores, restaurants, and more. These are recession-proof businesses, which means they can reliably pay their rent.\n\nThe company uses net leases, which obligate the tenant to pay taxes, insurance, and maintenance. It makes Realty Income's business more dependable because there isn't much to disrupt its revenue streams.\n\nRealty Income has paid and raised its dividend for 31 consecutive years, and its 71% dividend payout ratio leaves room for plenty more increases.\n\n2. A dependable 9.5% superyield\n\nAltria Group(NYSE: MO) sells tobacco products, primarily Marlboro cigarettes, in the United States. It also sells cigars, oral tobacco, and smokeless nicotine products like On oral pouches. Smoking rates in America have declined for decades, but Altria uses its pricing power to offset declining volumes with higher prices. The company is a Dividend King with 54 consecutive years of increases.\n\nStory continues\n\nA high dividend yield can be a red flag. However, Altria looks like an exception to the rule. Dependable cash flows, a manageable 80% payout ratio, and a strong balance sheet should allow management to keep tacking on small increases. The company must slowly transition away from cigarettes as a core business, but there is time for that to happen over the coming years. Until then, keep banking that humungous dividend.\n\n3. Warren Buffett's largest holding\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is more than a household name for its iOS devices: It's the largest investment in Warren Buffett's holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, by a country mile. Buffett admires the company for its strong loyalty from consumers who religiously buy and upgrade their iPhones, smartwatches, and other personal electronics. Apple is so big it generates a remarkable $106 billion in free cash flow annually. Not revenue, free cash flow.\n\nThat sets up investors for a ton of dividend growth. Apple has raised its dividend yearly since it began paying shareholders 11 years ago. The dividend payout ratio is still tiny at just 14%, so decades of dividend increases are likely ahead. That should be music to the ears of any long-term investor.\n\n4. A long-term wealth compounder\n\nHome Depot(NYSE: HD) is one of the most successful stocks ever. Shares have returned more than 3,000,000% since its initial public offering (IPO), creating life-changing returns for long-term investors. How? Home Depot became the largest home improvement retailer in North America. Homes are part of people's identity. People make upgrades and repairs, and new homes are constantly being built.\n\nThe company is also a stellar dividend stock. The company has raised its payout for 14 consecutive years after freezing it during the Great Recession. Today, the payout ratio is manageable at 46% of cash flow, so investors should look for raises to continue at a healthy pace. The average increase over the past five years is an impressive 15%.\n\n5. A legendary cult coffee brand\n\nStarbucks(NASDAQ: SBUX) has a grip on consumers that few food and beverage companies do. I'm sure you, or someone you know, loves their Starbucks. The company's loyalty program has a whopping 34.3 million active 90-day users in America alone.\n\nStarbucks has expanded from the northwestern United States to become a global juggernaut with 38,587 open stores worldwide. Starbucks is highly profitable and returns a lot of its profits to investors. The company has paid and raised its dividend for 13 consecutive years.\n\nIt also repurchases a ton of stock to help boost earnings growth. The company's outstanding shares have decreased 25% over the past decade. Juggling both has made Starbucks a stock that can deliver income at its current 2.4% yield and total returns. The payout ratio is solid at 56%, so investors can continue to buy and hold confidently and expect more of the same.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Realty Income right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Realty Income, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Realty Income wasn\u2019t one of them.

For context, we're talking about a nearly 20% annualized return spanning six decades, which is roughly double the annualized total return, including dividends, of the benchmark S&P 500 over the same period. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nEven though the Oracle of Omaha and his team of investors aren't perfect, their track record undeniably points to a history of recognizing plain-as-day values hiding in plain sight. This is why investors pay such close attention to Berkshire Hathaway's quarterly Form 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nA 13F offers a snapshot of what Wall Street's brightest minds purchased and sold in the latest quarter (in this instance, the December-ended quarter). However, Berkshire's 13F doesn't tell the complete story of Berkshire Hathaway's equity holdings.\n\nWarren Buffett has a \"secret\" portfolio that contains two prominent Magnificent Seven stocks\n\nIn 1998, Buffett's company completed a $22 billion acquisition of General Re. While the reinsurance segment was the catalyst behind the deal, General Re also owned a specialty investment firm known as New England Asset Management (NEAM). When Berkshire purchased General Re, it became the new parent of NEAM.\n\nBecause New England Asset Management continues to oversee more than $100 million in assets under management, it's required to file a 13F with the SEC every quarter. Although Warren Buffett isn't involved with the investing activity at NEAM in the same way he is with Berkshire Hathaway's $371 billion portfolio, the $621 million NEAM had invested as of Dec. 31, 2023 is, nevertheless, part of Berkshire Hathaway's aggregate holdings. In other words, New England Asset Management is Warren Buffett's \"secret\" portfolio.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs of the end of 2023, this $621 million portfolio held positions in 115 securities, which includes common stock, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and preferred stock. But what really stands out is this portfolio's stake in two of the Magnificent Seven stocks.\n\nThey are seven of the largest and most-influential publicly traded companies in the United States. I'm referring to:\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) MSFT Chart\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stocks have two lures. First, as you can see in the chart above, they have handily outperformed the broad-based S&P 500.\n\nMore importantly, the Magnificent Seven provide sustained competitive advantages and/or virtually impenetrate moats.\n\nMicrosoft's Windows is the leading global operating system, while its Azure has quickly become the world's No. 2 provider of cloud infrastructure services. Apple's iPhone is the clear leader in smartphone market share in the United States. Furthermore, Apple's share-repurchase program is unrivaled, with more than $600 billion worth of its common stock bought back since the start of 2013. Nvidia's A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) could account for up to a 90% share of GPUs deployed in artificial intelligence (AI) accelerated data centers in 2024. Amazon's marketplace captured a nearly 38% share of online spending in the U.S. in 2023. Meanwhile, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world's leading provider of cloud infrastructure services. Alphabet's Google accounted for more than 91% of global internet search in January. It also owns Google Cloud, the world's No. 3 cloud infrastructure service provider, and YouTube, the second-most-visited social site on the planet. Meta Platforms' social media real estate is unmatched. Facebook is the most-visited site globally, and its family of apps attracted just shy of 4 billion monthly active users in the fourth quarter. Tesla is North America's leading electric-vehicle (EV) maker and the only EV pure play that's generating a recurring profit, based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).\n\nWarren Buffett's secret portfolio holds stakes in two of these seven companies. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAlphabet\n\nThe first Magnificent Seven stock you'll find in Warren Buffett's hidden portfolio is Alphabet, the parent of internet search engine Google, streaming platform YouTube, cloud infrastructure service platform Google Cloud, and autonomous vehicle company Waymo, among other ventures. NEAM closed out December with 18,200 shares of Alphabet's Class A shares (GOOGL), which were worth more than $2.5 million at the time.\n\nThe longtime draw for investors to Alphabet has been its foundational search engine. It's been nearly nine years since Google last accounted for less than a 90% share of worldwide internet search in a given month. As a virtual monopoly, it is able to command exceptionally strong ad-pricing power and take advantage of disproportionately long periods of economic expansion. Internet search should continue to be a healthy cash-flow driver.\n\nHowever, the company's most-exciting cash flow growth is liable to come from its smaller but substantially faster-growing segments. For instance, Google Cloud delivered four consecutive quarters of operating income in 2023 after years of steady operating losses. Businesses are still very early in the cloud spending cycle, which suggests the high margins associated with cloud infrastructure services can really lift Alphabet's cash flow.\n\nSimilarly, YouTube's monthly active user count is marching higher. Daily views for Shorts (short-form videos that usually last less than 60 seconds) have climbed from 6.5 billion in early 2021 to north of 50 billion in early 2023. This represents an excellent monetization opportunity for YouTube, as well as another catalyst to spark an increase in high-margin subscriptions.\n\nAlphabet remains cheap, as well. Despite a sizable bounce from their 2022 bear market low, shares of the company can be picked up for less than 13 times estimated cash flow per share in 2025. That's a marked discount to the average multiple to cash flow of 17.9 that Alphabet has traded at over the trailing-five-year period.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nAt one time, Warren Buffett's \"secret\" portfolio had a sizable position in Apple and owned shares of GPU giant Nvidia. But as of Dec. 31, 2023, neither company remained in New England Asset Management's $621 million portfolio. The only Magnificent Seven stock represented in that portfolio, other than Alphabet, is tech stock Microsoft. NEAM held 30,845 shares of the company as of Dec. 31, which equated to roughly $11.6 million in market value.\n\nThe reason asset managers are attracted to Microsoft is its exceptional cash flow, which is a function of its seemingly flawless operating model and pristine balance sheet.\n\nAs I've pointed out previously, Microsoft's success is a reflection of its blending the old with the new. Although its legacy Windows and Office segments are no longer growing much, if at all, they still generate exceptionally juicy margins that provide abundant cash flow. The company is able to use this cash to reinvest in high-growth initiatives or make acquisitions.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, Microsoft is betting its future on cloud services (including Azure), as well as the rise of AI. It has invested billions in OpenAI, the company behind popular chatbot ChatGPT, and is expecting longtail growth from the AI revolution.\n\nAnd Microsoft is one of only two publicly traded companies with the highest possible credit rating (AAA) from Standard & Poor's, a division of S&P Global. The company closed out 2023 with $81 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, and it's on pace for almost $99 billion in net cash generated from operations in fiscal 2024, based on the $49.4 billion of net cash it has generated through the first six months of its current fiscal year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

This group includes high-profile tech companies that delivered excellent returns over the past decade: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla.\n\nSome of them, most notably Meta Platforms and Nvidia, have been outperformers since January, while others haven't had the same luck. Apple is in the latter category -- the stock is down by nearly 5% year to date, the second-worst performance in the group.\n\nStill, that's no reason to ignore Apple stock. Let's find out why Apple remains an excellent pick for long-term investors. GOOG Chart\n\nApple's quarterly update wasn't great\n\nApple's shares fell following the release of its financial results for the first quarter of 2024, which ended Dec. 30, 2023. The tech giant's results were not great, especially on the top line. Net sales increased by just about 2% year over year to $119.6 billion. Apple's earnings per share did increase by a solid 16% year over year to $2.18. There's a reason why investors weren't happy with Apple's quarterly report: The company's performance in one crucial region looks worrisome.\n\nThat region is China. Apple's sales in the country declined by 13% year over year to $20.8 billion -- that's roughly 17.4% of Apple's first-quarter 2024 revenue. Apple blamed lower sales of the iPhone and several other devices for the decline. However, this shouldn't be a long-lasting problem for Apple. Smartphone sales fell in China for much of last year partly due to economic issues.\n\nApple likely wasn't the only company affected. Moreover, Apple remains the top-selling smartphone brand in the country and elsewhere. CEO Tim Cook recently noted, \"According to a survey from Kantar, iPhones were four out of the top five models in the U.S. and Japan, four out of the top six models in urban China and the U.K., and all top five models in Australia.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nThere are two more reasons to look at Apple's first-quarter results with more optimism, especially concerning its performance in China.\n\nFirst, this period included 13 weeks compared to the 14 weeks from the previous fiscal year's parallel quarter. Second, currency exchange-rate fluctuations negatively impacted Apple's sales growth metrics in China.\n\nAt any rate, the economic slowdown in China won't last forever. More importantly, Apple has plenty of growth opportunities to exploit over the long run.\n\nPlenty of growth opportunities ahead\n\nApple's iPhone category remains the largest by revenue. In Q1 2024, the company's iPhone sales increased by about 6% to $69.7 billion. No other segment of the company did better in terms of revenue growth except Apple's services unit. Services sales grew by 11.3% year over year to $23.1 billion. While it still accounts for around 19% of Apple's revenue, the services segment might be the most important for the company's future.\n\nApple boasts an installed base of 2.2 billion devices and exceedingly high customer loyalty, which grants it the opportunity to create increasing, high-margin, recurring revenue from the suite of services it offers, from health-related apps to video and music streaming and more.\n\nThere's one key opportunity Apple is currently trying to get in on: artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nCook was a bit tight-lipped on the matter during the company's latest earnings conference call, only saying: \"As we look ahead, we will continue to invest in these and other technologies that will shape the future. That includes artificial intelligence where we continue to spend a tremendous amount of time and effort, and we're excited to share the details of our ongoing work in that space later this year.\"\n\nApple is unquestionably trailing some of its peers in the potentially highly lucrative AI market. Microsoft and Alphabet are way ahead.\n\nStill, it'd be unwise to bet against Apple here. After all, it has made it a business -- and a highly successful one at that -- to put its own tweak on existing technologies. Apple generates enough money to pour into research and development (R&D) and make headway into this space.\n\nApple has $106.9 billion in free cash flow. But whether within AI, healthcare, fintech, or some other area, the company has multiple growth paths that should enable it to remain successful for a long time.\n\nSo, Apple's recent issues in China are by no means a deal breaker. If anything, long-term investors should take this opportunity to scoop up the company's shares while it lags most of its Magnificent Seven peers year to date.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

The decision followed months of frenzied meetings between top executives and the company\u2019s board over how to proceed. Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams and project head Kevin Lynch broke the news to the roughly 2,000-member team during a meeting that lasted less than 15 minutes.\n\nThe upshot: Apple\u2019s future isn\u2019t going to hinge on selling $100,000 cars with self-driving features. Instead, it will focus on catching up with rivals in the generative AI industry, where chatbots from OpenAI and Google have captured the imagination of consumers and investors. The shift also lets Apple concentrate on turning the Vision Pro headset \u2014 still a fledgling product \u2014 into a mainstream hit.\n\nInvestors and analysts applauded the move, which lets Apple avoid an electric-vehicle market that\u2019s grown more perilous in recent months. Shifting resources toward generative AI is the right call \u201cgiven the long-term profitability potential of AI revenue streams versus cars,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Anurag Rana and Andrew Girard said.\n\nBut the decision also eliminates a future revenue source at a time when Apple has been struggling to maintain growth. Though the company managed to pull out of a sales slump last quarter, it warned that the current period will be sluggish again. The Vision Pro just launched this month and isn\u2019t expected to be a major contributor to growth for years, if ever.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith a car, profit margins would have been slim but the revenue potential was massive. The idea was long touted as one of Apple\u2019s famous \u201cnext big things\u201d and could have more firmly locked consumers into the company\u2019s ecosystem. Tesla Inc., which led the EV revolution in the US, generated nearly $100 billion in revenue last year. Furthermore, tech giants like Alphabet Inc. and Chinese rivals remain focused on cars.\n\nApple\u2019s decadelong car effort, known as Project Titan, also was an AI challenge in itself. Apple attempted to build an artificial intelligence system that was powerful and energy-efficient enough to make a car fully autonomous.\n\nWith that off the table, Apple can concentrate on applying AI to its current products, including the iPhone and iPad, and avoid falling further behind tech peers like Alphabet\u2019s Google, Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp.\n\nApple is planning to reveal new AI capabilities, including more automated tools for software development and features for summarizing news articles, at its conference for developers in June. The first new features are planned for iOS 18, which will be released around September alongside the next iPhones, Bloomberg News has reported.\n\nRead More: Apple Readies AI Tool to Rival Microsoft\u2019s GitHub Copilot\n\nThose efforts now have fresh recruits, thanks to the winding down of the car endeavor \u2014 known as the Special Projects Group, or SPG. The company will relocate about a third of the vehicle team to other divisions.\n\nMeanwhile, hundreds of people working on autonomous driving hardware, car interiors and exteriors, and vehicle electronics will need to seek new jobs inside the company. If they can\u2019t find roles, they\u2019ll be laid off. And some employees have already been informed that they\u2019ll be heading for the exits.\n\nThree main groups within SPG \u2014 a software team based in Ottawa under executive Dan Dodge; a cloud engineering and software group under Libo Meyers; and a software project management team under Vera Carr \u2014 will be shifted to Craig Federighi\u2019s software department to work on Apple\u2019s main operating systems.\n\nApple\u2019s artificial intelligence team for the car, which had been reporting to Stuart Bowers, will be shifted to work on generative AI in John Giannandrea\u2019s machine learning division. Some of the car talent could also apply their skills to the Vision Pro. That product has many features, including the ability to create a virtual representation of its wearer, that rely on artificial intelligence.\n\nThe big question is how soon AI might make serious money for Apple. It\u2019s unlikely that the company will have a full-scale AI lineup of applications and features for a few years. And Apple\u2019s penchant for user privacy could make it challenging to compete aggressively in the market.\n\nFor now, Apple will continue to make most of its money from hardware. The iPhone alone accounts for about half its revenue. So AI\u2019s biggest potential in the near term will be its ability to sell iPhones, iPads and other devices.\n\nAs for the Vision Pro, which melds virtual and augmented reality, that too is years away from being a major moneymaker. The immersive technology has thrilled some early adopters, but the first version of the device remains too cumbersome and costly. Even if it sells a few million units a year, the $3,500 headset will only be a small percentage of Apple\u2019s nearly $400 billion annual revenue total.\n\nThe company is exploring other big ideas, including lighter-weight AR glasses, new smart-home devices and AirPods with cameras. But it will take years to tell whether a range of smaller products can replace what would have been Apple\u2019s biggest: a car.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nElon Musk\u2019s Vegas Tunnel Project Has Been Racking Up Safety Violations Hong Kong\u2019s Hottest New Store Is the Costco in Shenzhen There\u2019s One Musk Endeavor That\u2019s Not Doing So Great Transcript: Did Musk Buy Twitter to Keep His Movements Secret?

The company, known for its cloud software platform that manages and secures Apple products, reported a year-over-year revenue growth of 17%, signaling robust performance despite economic challenges.\n\nJamf's cloud-based Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solutions are sold through a subscription model, catering to a diverse clientele that includes businesses, educational institutions, hospitals, and government agencies.

Jamf Holding Corp (JAMF) Reports Solid Growth Amidst Economic Headwinds\n\nFinancial Performance and Strategic Initiatives\n\nJamf's fiscal year 2023 was marked by a significant 17% increase in total revenue, amounting to $560.6 million. The company's Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) also saw a 15% rise, reaching $588.6 million. This growth is indicative of Jamf's strong market position and the increasing demand for its Apple-first enterprise solutions.\n\nDespite the positive revenue growth, Jamf reported a GAAP operating loss of $115.2 million, which is an improvement from the previous year's $138.9 million loss. The reduction in operating loss, coupled with a non-GAAP operating income of $45.4 million, reflects the company's strategic efforts in cost management and operational efficiency.\n\nStory continues\n\nJamf's gross profit margins remained robust, with a GAAP gross profit of $434.5 million, or 78% of total revenue, and a non-GAAP gross profit of $460.1 million, or 82% of total revenue. These figures underscore the company's ability to maintain profitability in its core operations.\n\nThe company's cash flow from operations stood at $36.0 million, representing 6% of total revenue, while unlevered free cash flow was reported at $55.4 million, or 10% of total revenue. These cash flow metrics are crucial for Jamf's ability to invest in growth initiatives and navigate economic uncertainties.\n\n\"We achieved significant margin improvement on both on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis in 2023 as a result of revenue outperformance and diligent cost management,\" said Ian Goodkind, Jamf CFO. \"As we look to the next three years, well ramp up our efforts to increase profitability to align our cost structure with the current revenue growth profile of Jamf, with the goal of exceeding the Rule of 40 in 2026.\"\n\nJamf's balance sheet remains solid, with cash and cash equivalents totaling $243.6 million as of December 31, 2023. The company's commitment to strategic investments and cost management is expected to drive further financial improvements and shareholder value.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nAs Jamf looks forward to the fiscal year 2024, it anticipates total revenue to be between $614.5 and $619.5 million, with non-GAAP operating income projected to be between $89.0 and $93.0 million. These forward-looking statements reflect the company's confidence in its business model and the continued demand for its solutions.\n\nJamf's emphasis on security and innovation is evident in its recent business highlights, including a 33% year-over-year growth in security ARR and the launch of support for Apple Vision Pro. The company's participation in the Microsoft Security Copilot Partner Private Preview and the release of its annual Security 360: Annual Trends Report further demonstrate its commitment to staying at the forefront of enterprise security.\n\nValue investors and potential GuruFocus.com members interested in the software industry and cloud-based SaaS solutions will find Jamf Holding Corp (NASDAQ:JAMF)'s financial results and strategic direction indicative of a company poised for continued growth and profitability.

Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs one of the largest holdings for many Charles Schwab investment portfolios focused on long-term stocks, Microsoft saw its shares increase substantially over the last year. The software giant experienced impressive growth of around 70% in its stock price during 2023. However, this level of growth has been common for Microsoft over the long term, with its shares increasing almost ten-fold in value in the past decade alone.\n\nCharles Schwab analysts believe that Microsoft can continue expanding its business and market share for many years. Even though some commentators worry about a tech bubble given high valuations across the sector, Schwab\u2019s ongoing increases in its holdings of Microsoft shares show faith that the company remains well-positioned as a long-term stock pick.\n\nWith a current price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 37x and an average price target of $456 per share, Charles Schwab continues to see upside potential in holding Microsoft as a core long-term stock within its client investment portfolios.\n\nStory continues\n\nMerck (MRK) Merck (MRK) logo outside of corporate building\n\nSource: Atmosphere1 / Shutterstock.com\n\nMerck (NYSE:MRK), one of the long-term stocks featured in recent Charles Schwab stock picks, has witnessed its P/E ratio expand considerably. From late 2023 through to the present, its valuation increased substantially from 19.4 to 71.\n\nThe company relies heavily on its cancer treatment drug Keytruda, which recently received expanded approval for use within the European Union. Analysts consider the now long-term stock to have further growth potential moving forward and also view Merck as well positioned to withstand a potential economic downturn due to the nature of its operations.\n\nAccording to its most recent quarterly disclosures, the Charles Schwab stock has received a sizable investment, totaling over half a billion U.S. dollars.\u200b\u200b\n\nVeralto Holdings (VLTO) Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words \"buy\" and \"sell\" displayed on the screen.

The company provides water treatment and water quality solutions and posted relatively modest Q4 results last month.\n\nThe company saw sales increase by 3% over the last year and forecast similar growth for the coming year. Analysts also see modest similar growth in the company\u2019s share price this year. Overall, it seems the interest in the long-term stock is based on expectations that it will deliver solid, albeit modest, growth in the coming years as water scarcity becomes a top concern when exacerbated by climate change.\n\nThe company trades at a P/E ratio of 25.5x, slightly below the benchmarkS&P 500 index\u2019s 27.6x times.\u200b\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nOn the date of publication, Stavros Tousios did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

It is understood that there will also be redundancies.\n\nApple had been working on the car - codenamed Project Titan - since 2014. It aimed to deliver breakthrough battery technology that would radically cut their cost, according to insiders, and create car software that would mean the car would genuinely drive itself.\n\nIn January, it was revealed that Apple was delaying the release of the car from 2026 to 2028 and had cut the ambitions for its self-driving capabilities, so that it would offer a capability similar to Tesla\u2019s Autopilot technology.\n\nThis would mean the car would perform some manoeuvres on its own, such as braking, lane changing, parking or driving on a motorway, but with the driver remaining in control. Artist's impression of how Apple's electric car might have looked - Vanarama\n\nThe cancellation of the project comes amid escalating competition between electric carmakers, with China\u2019s BYD overtaking Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla as the world\u2019s best-selling electric vehicle manufacturer.\n\nThe Chinese firm\u2019s rise - fuelled by low prices - has alarmed Western carmakers, with the boss of Renault, Luca de Meo, urging Europe and Britain to jointly pursue an industrial policy to encourage \u201cEuropean champions\u201d.\n\nAnalysts had queried the logic of Apple entering the car industry. \u201cIt makes no sense whatsoever for Apple to sell a car,\u201d technology analyst Richard Windsor said last year. \u201cApple makes 40-50pc gross margins on the products it sells, and it will not make that on seats and steering wheels.\u201d\n\nApple\u2019s decision to axe the project takes place as investors show signs of nervousness about the company\u2019s growth potential. Its shares are down over 4pc during the past month with the company facing battles on multiple fronts.\n\nStory continues\n\nIts sales in China plunged 13pc in the final quarter of 2023, with its share of phones priced above $600 (\u00a3470) falling from 75pc to 71pc. Huawei, in particular, is eating into Apple\u2019s sales in the country, after launching its Mate 60 Pro phone, which has proved a hit.\n\nApple has also suffered the distraction of court battles over its smart watches, while some customers of its high-cost Vision Pro headsets, its first major product launch since the Apple Watch in 2015, have returned them complaining that the\u00a0gadgets are making them feel sick.

The decision was shared by Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams and Kevin Lynch, a vice president in charge of the effort, according to the people.\n\nThe two executives told staffers that the project will begin winding down and that many employees on the car team \u2014 known as the Special Projects Group, or SPG \u2014 will be shifted to the artificial intelligence division under executive John Giannandrea. Those employees will focus on generative AI projects, an increasingly key priority for the company.\n\nThe Apple car team also has several hundred hardware engineers and car designers. It\u2019s possible they will be able to apply for jobs on other Apple teams. There will be layoffs, but it\u2019s unclear how many.\n\nApple, based in Cupertino, California, declined to comment.\n\nThe move came as a relief to some investors, who pared declines in the stock on Tuesday. The shares gained about 0.5% to $182.01 at 2:18 p.m. in New York after Bloomberg reported the news.\n\nElon Musk, head of Tesla Inc., also celebrated the move. He sent a post on X with a saluting emoji.\n\nThe decision to ultimately wind down the project is a bombshell for the company, ending a multibillion-dollar effort that would have vaulted Apple into a whole new industry. The tech giant started working on a car around 2014, setting its sights on a fully autonomous electric vehicle with a limousine-like interior and voice-guided navigation.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut the project struggled nearly from the start, with Apple changing the team\u2019s leadership and strategy several times. Lynch and Williams took over the undertaking a few years ago \u2014 following the departure of Doug Field, now a senior executive at Ford Motor Co.\n\nApple\u2019s most senior executives finalized the decision in recent weeks, according to the people. It comes just a month after Bloomberg News reported that the project reached a make-or-break point. The most recent approach discussed internally was delaying a car release until 2028 and reducing self-driving specifications from Level 4 to Level 2+ technology.\n\nMost recently, Apple had imagined the car being priced at around $100,000. But executives were concerned about the vehicle being able to provide the profit margins that Apple typically enjoys on its products. The company\u2019s board was also concerned about continuing to spend hundreds of millions of dollars a year on a project that may never see the light of day.\n\nApple continues to invest heavily in other areas. The company spent $113 billion on total research and development over the past five years, with an average annual growth rate of about 16%. The company also recently launched the Vision Pro headset \u2014 its first new product category in almost a decade \u2014 and has built up that business.\n\n(Updates with shares in the sixth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nElon Musk\u2019s Vegas Tunnel Project Has Been Racking Up Safety Violations Hong Kong\u2019s Hottest New Store Is the Costco in Shenzhen Transcript: Did Musk Buy Twitter to Keep His Movements Secret?

But a key stage called production validation testing, or PVT, was halted due to the bug.

Sonos\u2019 sales have stagnated in recent years, and his comeback plan involves getting into a number of new categories. But it means going up against big rivals, including Apple Inc., Sony Group Corp. and Bose Corp.\n\nInvestors have grown more optimistic. The shares are up 11% this year following a flat performance in 2023 and a 43% plunge the prior year. On Tuesday, the stock briefly went negative after Bloomberg reported on the headphone delay. The shares rebounded to a gain of almost 1%.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company, which has been working on headphones since at least 2019, plans to sell the device in black and white options \u2014 similar to the color choices on its current products. The headphones are designed to work with existing Sonos devices, including smart speakers, and stream audio directly from TVs and various music services.\n\nThe Santa Barbara, California-based company is eyeing other new categories as well. That includes a previously unreported large speaker for use at parties, according to the people. It would compete with the PartyBox from JBL, a popular speaker maker and subsidiary of Samsung Electronics Co.\u2019s Harman, and launch in 2026.\n\nThe Sonos headphones, codenamed Duke, will be the biggest test yet for Spence, who took the helm in 2017. He hasn\u2019t officially announced the plans but has touted the imminent arrival of a new device.\n\n\u201cWe now turn our undivided attention to the launch of our highly anticipated new product, which we will announce and ship in Q3,\u201d Spence said during an earnings call this month. The company\u2019s fiscal third quarter runs through June.\n\n\u201cThis launch will give us a foothold into a new multibillion-dollar category, expanding the number of categories we play in from five to six and further diversifying our business,\u201d he said.\n\nSonos is planning to eventually offer the headphones in all its major markets and will add new retail partners to help sell the device. The company is also discussing a second-generation model internally and exploring the idea of an in-ear model \u2014 codenamed Disco \u2014 aimed at Apple\u2019s AirPods. The latter may also connect to Wi-Fi for streaming. Most headphones typically only use Bluetooth.\n\nRead More: Sonos Plans to Cut Jobs as It Prepares Push Into Headphones\n\nThe headphones have taken a circuitous route to market. People with knowledge of their development say Sonos originally planned to release headphones codenamed Trident in mid-2021, but Spence shelved the project at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020.\n\nTo get ready for the headphone launch, Sonos is planning a revamped mobile app codenamed Passport. That will allow users to more easily set up and control Sonos products outside of the home. But the new app has faced software-engineering challenges as well and probably won\u2019t launch until May. It was originally planned for March. Sonos wants to release it at least a few weeks before the headphones debut.\n\nSonos is also working on a television set-top box, new TV sound bars, an upgraded portable speaker and fresh amplifiers, Bloomberg has reported. But the set-top box \u2014 a rival to Apple TV and Roku Inc. devices \u2014 has hit some delays as well, with the company now expecting a launch around August 2025 instead of as early as this year.\n\n(Updates with latest on shares in seventh paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nElon Musk\u2019s Vegas Tunnel Project Has Been Racking Up Safety Violations Hong Kong\u2019s Hottest New Store Is the Costco in Shenzhen Transcript: Did Musk Buy Twitter to Keep His Movements Secret?

For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Warren Buffett 2024 Portfolio: Top 5 Stock Picks.\n\nWarren Buffett recently penned his anticipated annual letter to Berkshire shareholders. The key themes of Buffett's letter were similar to what they are every year, and understandably so. Buffett does not believe in changing his investing strategies based on short-term market movements. Buffett said Berkshire's goal remains owning entire or parts of businesses which \"enjoy good economics that are fundamental and enduring.\"\n\nBuffett on Lack of Good Investing Opportunities\n\nWhat caught the market's attention was Buffett's revelation that Berkshire's cash pile has soared to about $167.6 billion as of the end of 2023. But what was alarming in this figure was the reason why Buffett, who is always a fan of letting the money do the work, is not deploying this cash. Buffett said that there remain \"only a handful\" of companies that impress Berkshire in the US and outside the country there are \"essentially no candidates\" for capital deployment opportunities for Berkshire.\n\nBuffett said to think that investors have gotten wiser over time would be a mistake. The billionaire said the constant availability of financial news and trading platforms have only made the investors \"active\" because of the \"casino-like\" behavior of the markets.\n\n\"Market Seizures\": An Opportunity for Warren Buffett\n\nIn his latest letter, Warren Buffett talked about how he likes to view \"market seizures\" as investing opportunities:\n\n\"Occasionally, markets and/or the economy will cause stocks and bonds of some large and fundamentally good businesses to be strikingly mispriced. Indeed, markets can \u2013 and will \u2013 unpredictably seize up or even vanish as they did for four months in 1914 and for a few days in 2001. If you believe that American investors are now more stable than in the past, think back to September 2008. Speed of communication and the wonders of technology facilitate instant worldwide paralysis, and we have come a long way since smoke signals. Such instant panics won\u2019t happen often \u2013 but they will happen. Berkshire\u2019s ability to immediately respond to market seizures with both huge sums and certainty of performance may offer us an occasional large-scale opportunity. Though the stock market is massively larger than it was in our early years, today\u2019s active participants are neither more emotionally stable nor better taught than when I was in school. For whatever reasons, markets now exhibit far more casino-like behavior than they did when I was young. The casino now resides in many homes and daily tempts the occupants.\"\n\nStory continues Warren Buffett 2024 Portfolio: Top Stock Picks\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we scanned Warren Buffett's Q4'2023 portfolio and chose his top 12 stock picks. These were the stocks Buffett had in his portfolio heading into 2024.\u00a0 Some top picks of Berkshire are Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Coca-Cola Co (NYSE:KO) and Chevron Corp (NYSE:CVX). Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\n12. Kroger Co (NYSE:KR)\n\nWarren Buffett's Stake:\u00a0$2,285,500,000\n\nWarren Buffett continues to hold Kroger Co (NYSE:KR)\u00a0in his portfolio for 2024. Berkshire Hathaway had a $2.3 billion stake in the grocery company as of the end of 2023. BofA recently set a $65 price target on Kroger Co (NYSE:KR)\u00a0stock, which shows a strong upside potential from the current levels of around $47.\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 45 hedge funds out of the 933 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Kroger Co (NYSE:KR).\n\nIn its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter, Oakmark Global Fund stated the following regarding The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR):\n\n\u201cThe Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) (U.S.) is the second-largest grocery retailer in America, behind only Walmart. Although the grocery industry is highly competitive, Kroger\u2019s scale advantages allow it to offer a more compelling value proposition than smaller peers and earn higher returns on capital. In recent years, the market has assigned Kroger a lower multiple due to concerns that e-commerce would disrupt traditional brick-and-mortar grocery businesses. However, we believe Kroger\u2019s performance through the pandemic highlighted that its store footprint, distribution infrastructure, technology investments and strong brand all position the company well for a world with higher online grocery adoption. The stock trades for just 10x our estimate of next year\u2019s EPS, which we believe is attractive given Kroger\u2019s competitive positioning and earnings growth outlook. The pending merger with Albertsons could accelerate the company\u2019s earnings growth and produce additional scale advantages. If the merger is not approved, the company will have the capacity to return over 25% of its market cap to shareholders.\u201d\n\n11.\u00a0VeriSign, Inc (NASDAQ:VRSN)\n\nWarren Buffett's Stake:\u00a0$2,639,503,654\n\nDNS registry and internet infrastructure company VeriSign, Inc (NASDAQ:VRSN) ranks 11th in our list of the best Warren Buffett stocks for 2024. Berkshire owns a $2.6 billion stake in VeriSign, Inc (NASDAQ:VRSN) as of the end of 2023. The stock is down by about 3.8% over the past one year.\n\nIn February, VeriSign, Inc (NASDAQ:VRSN)\u00a0posted Q4 results. Adjusted EPS in the period came in at $2.60, beating estimates by $0.74. Revenue in the period jumped 3% year over year to $380.4 million, surpassing estimates by $2.53 million.\n\n10.\u00a0Citigroup Inc (NYSE:C)\n\nWarren Buffett's Stake:\u00a0$2,841,792,358\n\nWarren Buffett's 2024 portfolio includes Citigroup Inc (NYSE:C), in which the billionaire's Berkshire Hathaway owns a $2.84 billion stake.

Berkshire owns a $3.78 billion stake in Davita Inc (NYSE:DVA) as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023. \u00a0Earlier this month Davita Inc (NYSE:DVA) posted fourth quarter results. Adjusted EPS in the quarter came in at $1.87, beating estimates by $0.21. Revenue in the quarter jumped 7.9% year over year to $3.15 billion, beating estimates by $140 million.\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of last year, 39 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Davita Inc (NYSE:DVA).\n\n8.\u00a0Moody's Corp (NYSE:MCO)\n\nWarren Buffett's Stake:\u00a0$9,635,028,496\n\nWarren Buffett's 2024 portfolio features Moody's Corp (NYSE:MCO), whose shares are up by about 29% over the past one year. Moody's Corp's\u00a0(NYSE:MCO)\u00a0recently increased its dividend by 10.4% and said its board of directors authorized an additional $1 billion in share repurchases.\n\nA total of 56 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Moody's Corp (NYSE:MCO)\u00a0as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nL1 Capital International Fund made the following comment about Moody\u2019s Corporation (NYSE:MCO) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cPortfolio adjustments during the September 2023 quarter were modest, diversified, but meaningful. In total around 10% of the Fund was divested and reinvested into opportunities we consider provide a superior risk-adjusted base case return.\n\nWe continued to trim our investment in high-quality technology businesses such as Intuit, mentioned previously. These adjustments were purely for valuation considerations, rather than any business concerns and some of these companies remain significant portfolio holdings.\n\nThe Fund\u2019s remaining investment in\u00a0Moody\u2019s Corporation (NYSE:MCO)\u2019s was fully divested during the September quarter. Moody\u2019s is the world\u2019s leading credit rating, risk assessment and analytics business. The core credit ratings business is largely a duopoly with S&P Global, with modest competition from Fitch Ratings and regional competitors \u2013 a great example of our preferred \u2018Noah\u2019s Ark\u2019 industry structure.\n\nThe share price of Moody\u2019s has been volatile over recent times, often reacting too greatly to changes in short-term capital markets conditions. During the quarter we took advantage of positive market sentiment to divest our holding at a share price we considered to be above fair value. Moody\u2019s is very well managed and \u2018ticks all our boxes\u2019 for one of the world\u2019s highest-quality businesses. The company has moved from our Portfolio to our Bench of potential investments. Having a Bench of \u2018ready to go\u2019 investment opportunities is a core aspect of our investment process. We continue to analyse Moody\u2019s as if we owned it and are excited by the pull-back in the share price from recent highs.\u201d\n\n7.\u00a0Kraft Heinz Co (NASDAQ:KHC)\n\nWarren Buffett's Stake:\u00a0$12,041,975,570\n\nKraft Heinz Co (NASDAQ:KHC)\u00a0is one of the most important stocks in Warren Buffett's 2024 portfolio.

He even once stated, \"When we own portions of outstanding businesses with outstanding managements, our favorite holding period is forever.\"\n\nHowever, Buffett doesn't hold forever every stock he buys. There's a good bit of churn in Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) portfolio. But the legendary investor has identified a handful of Berkshire's holdings that he believes are forever stocks. Buffett just revealed the eight stocks that he thinks Berkshire Hathaway will likely hold forever -- and Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) wasn't one of them.\n\nTwo long-term Berkshire holdings\n\nIn his letter written to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders last year, Buffett discussed two long-term holdings -- American Express(NYSE: AXP) and The Coca-Cola Company(NYSE: KO). He noted that Berkshire completed building big positions in both stocks in the mid-1990s after several years of buying.\n\nAmerican Express and Coca-Cola have been massive winners for Buffett and Berkshire. In his letter written last year, he used them to make an important point: \"The weeds wither away in significance as the flowers bloom. Over time, it takes just a few winners to work wonders.\"\n\nBuffett mentioned AmEx and Coca-Cola again in his most recent letter to Berkshire shareholders, which was released on Saturday. He emphasized the lesson from these two purchases: \"When you find a truly wonderful business, stick with it.\"\n\nAnother stock Buffett really likes\n\nIn his latest shareholder letter, Buffett added other stocks that he said Berkshire \"expect[s] to maintain indefinitely.\" The first new addition to the list was Occidental Petroleum(NYSE: OXY).\n\nBerkshire has been buying Occidental shares hand over fist. At the end of 2023, the conglomerate's stake in the company stood at 27.8%. It's now the sixth-largest position in Berkshire's portfolio.\n\nBuffett stressed that Berkshire doesn't have any intention of fully acquiring Occidental or gaining control of the oil and gas producer. However, he said that \"we very much like our ownership,\" along with the option to increase its position.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere are two things about Occidental that Buffett especially likes. First, the company has extensive oil and gas operations in the U.S. Second, Occidental is a leader in carbon capture.\n\nAlthough Buffett acknowledged that the technology is still unproven, he argued that it, along with Occidental's large oil and gas holdings, \"are very much in our country's interest.\"\n\nFive birds of a feather\n\nBuffett discussed the other five stocks that he believes Berkshire will hold practically forever as a group, rather than individually. They're the five huge Japanese trading houses:\n\nItochu(OTC: ITOCF)(OTC: ITOCY) Marubeni(OTC: MARUY) Mitsui(OTC: MITSF)(OTC: MITSY) Mitsubishi(OTC: MSBHF) Sumitomo(OTC: SSUM.F)(OTC: SSUM.Y)\n\nBerkshire currently owns stakes of roughly 9% in each of these Japanese companies. Buffett noted that the conglomerate has committed that it wouldn't increase its ownership in any of them beyond 9.9%.\n\nWhat does Buffett like about these five companies? For one thing, he mentioned that each of them \"operates in a highly diversified manner somewhat similar to the way Berkshire itself is run.\" He likes the Japanese companies' policies that are beneficial to shareholders, including smart stock buybacks. Buffett also stated that the investments could open the door for Berkshire to partner with the companies down the road.\n\nWhat about Apple?\n\nApple remains Berkshire's largest holding, by far. Buffett didn't list the tech giant in his list of stocks that Berkshire would hold forever. In the fourth quarter of 2023, Berkshire even trimmed its position in Apple.\n\nDoes this mean that Buffett doesn't view Apple as a forever kind of stock? I don't think so.\n\nFor one thing, it's important to remember that Buffett only focuses on a small number of specific Berkshire holdings in each shareholder letter. He didn't discuss Occidental (except for one brief mention), Itochu, Marubeni, Mitsui, Mitsubishi, or Sumitomo in last year's letter, even though Berkshire owned all of these stocks then.\n\nIn May 2023 at Berkshire's shareholder meeting, Buffett stated that Apple \"is a better business than any we own.\" Again, all eight of the stocks that he thinks Berkshire will own indefinitely were in Berkshire's portfolio when he made that statement.\n\nThe bottom line is that we shouldn't assume that there aren't other stocks in addition to American Express, Coca-Cola, Occidental, and the five Japanese trading-house stocks that Berkshire will hold for decades to come. I'd bet that if Buffett were asked to name the full list, Apple would be on it -- and probably several other stocks, too.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

Working with the open-source RISC-V standard, Tenstorrent aims to provide customers with an alternative to the leaders Nvidia Corp. and Arm Holdings Plc, who have their own so-called instruction sets to communicate between hardware and software.\n\nThe Japanese government is funding a range of projects from research to advanced chip manufacturing, making an ambitious $67 billion bid to reclaim a central role in the semiconductor industry. The Tenstorrent agreement has the potential to advance those efforts, with the goal of producing the jointly designed AI chips at the government-backed startup Rapidus Corp.\n\n\u201cConcerns around AI using up all the electricity in the world make technology to decrease power consumption important,\u201d said Rapidus Chief Executive Officer Atsuyoshi Koike at the event alongside Tenstorrent CEO Keller. \u201cWith Tenstorrent, we hope to launch AI accelerators at the fastest time-to-market rate.\u201d\n\nThe 18-month-old company is aiming to begin chip production in 2027 in competition with leaders Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Electronics Co. But Rapidus will need customers for its facility and Keller\u2019s team sees Japan working to ensure both supply and demand.\n\n\u201cWhat Japan is doing is they recognize that you can\u2019t just build a fab and hope,\u201d David Bennett, chief customer officer of Tenstorrent, said in an interview. \u201cSo they\u2019re taking large investments to make sure that they\u2019re filling this fab. So what you see today is really the first one.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nBennett said that Tenstorrent has \u201cline of sight to hundreds of millions of dollars of business in Japan\u201d and is working closely with the Japanese government and corporations. His firm presently has 400 employees across the US, Canada, Serbia, India, South Korea and Japan. Tenstorrent is also in close contact with the US government to ensure it\u2019s in full compliance with Washington\u2019s technology export controls.\n\nBeside Keller, Tenstorrent has Keith Witek, who spent 13 years at Advanced Micro Devices Inc., as its chief operating officer and Wei-han Lien as its chief chip architect. Lien led Apple\u2019s work on advancing its in-house chip design, which has grown from powering the iPhone to also running its iPads and even desktop Mac computers.\n\nIn Japan, the company will work on AI chip designs with the government research group, known as Leading-edge Semiconductor Technology Center or LSTC.\n\nStill, production in Japan may be a challenge. Rapidus\u2019 goal of manufacturing state-of-the-art, 2-nanometer logic chips by 2027 is considered something of a long shot.\n\nJapan\u2019s LSTC will pursue and promote AI tech dedicated to \u201cedge inference processing applications, including generative AI, through international collaboration,\u201d its chairman, Tetsuro Higashi, said in the announcement.

Three ETFs with big positions in Nvidia, the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH), the iShares U.S. Technology ETF (NYSEARCA:IYW), and the Invesco S&P Momentum ETF (NYSEARCA:SPMO) are reaping the rewards of Nvidia\u2019s historic run and look poised to capture more upside if shares continues to rise.\n\nTo find these ETFs featuring significant Nvidia exposure, I went to Nvidia\u2019s page on TipRanks and used the ETF Exposure tab on the side of the page, a useful tool that enables investors to sort through ETFs by a stock\u2019s percentage weight within the ETF.\n\nLet\u2019s take a more in-depth look at these three ETFs, which all have different strategies and different reasons for owning Nvidia. All have large positions in the surging stock, which is up 235.5% over the past year and closing in on a $2 trillion market cap.\n\n1. VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NYSEARCA:SMH)\n\nSMH is a $16 billion ETF from VanEck that, according to the fund, seeks to give investors \u201cexposure to the top 25 most liquid U.S.-listed semiconductor companies, spanning the entire industry value chain from chip design and fabrication to manufacturing machinery.\u201d\n\nSMH has a massive Nvidia position. In fact it makes up over one-quarter of this semiconductor-focused fund\u2019s assets, with a weighting of 25.7%.\n\nBelow, you\u2019ll find an overview of SMH\u2019s top 10 holdings using TipRanks\u2019 holdings tool.\n\nIn addition to Nvidia, SMH owns Nvidia\u2019s competitors like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), and it also owns companies that are vital to the semiconductor manufacturing process like foundry Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) and semiconductor equipment manufacturers Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT), Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX), and ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML).\n\nSMH\u2019s top holdings are viewed favorably by TipRanks\u2019 Smart Score system, as eight out of SMH\u2019s top 10 holdings feature Outperform-equivalent Smart Scores of 8 or above. The Smart Score is a proprietary quantitative stock scoring system created by TipRanks. It gives stocks a score from 1 to 10 based on eight market key factors. A score of 8 or above is equivalent to an Outperform rating.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis ETF has crushed the market in recent years, thanks in no small part to its outsized position in Nvidia. As of January 31, SMH has returned an impressive 18.8% over the past three years, a phenomenal 32.1% over the past five years, and an incredible 26.1% over the past 10 years, easily beating the broader market S&P 500 (SPX) and tech-oriented Nasdaq (NDX) indices over each time frame.\n\nOf note, SMH has an expense ratio of 0.35%, meaning that an investor in the fund will pay $35 in fees on a $10,000 investment annually.\n\nI\u2019m bullish on SMH, given its large position in Nvidia, its track record of market-beating performance, and its portfolio of highly-rated stocks (according to Smart Score ratings). For investors looking to gain exposure to Nvidia in ETF form, SMH is a great way to do so due to its massive 25.7% Nvidia position and the fact that it gives you exposure to additional stocks that are swimming in the same lane as Nvidia.\n\nIs SMH Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nSell-side analysts view SMH favorably, giving it a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 21 Buys, five Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average SMH stock price target of $223.22 implies 6.1% upside potential from current levels.\n\n2. iShares U.S. Technology ETF\u00a0(IYW)\n\nMeanwhile, the iShares U.S. Technology ETF owns Nvidia as part of its strategy to \u201ctrack the investment results of an index composed of U.S. equities in the technology sector.\u201d IYW invests in U.S.-based electronics companies, computer hardware and software companies, and IT companies.\n\nNvidia makes up 6.8% of IYW\u2019s assets under management. This is a relatively large position, but it pales in comparison to SMH\u2019s massive 25.7% position.\u00a0Altogether, IYW owns 135 stocks, and its top 10 holdings make up 63.9% of the fund.\n\nBelow is an overview of IYW\u2019s top 10 holdings using TipRanks\u2019 Holdings tool.\n\nAs you can see, IYW has a broader focus than SMH, so while it has top-10 positions in semiconductor stocks like Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), it also owns stocks from beyond the semiconductor space like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META).\n\nLike SMH, IYW\u2019s portfolio is viewed favorably by TipRanks\u2019 Smart Score, and even more so, an impressive nine out of SMH\u2019s top 10 holdings feature Outperform-equivalent Smart Scores of 8 or above.\n\nWhile this ETF\u2019s focus is different than SMH\u2019s, one thing that the two funds have in common is that they\u2019ve both generated excellent returns over time. As of January 31, IYW has put up annualized returns of 14.2% over the past three years, 24.5% over the past five years, and 20.2% over the past 10 years.\n\nIYW has an expense ratio of 0.40%, meaning that investors in the fund will pay $40 in fees annually on a $10,000 investment.\n\nI\u2019m bullish on IYW overall, given its strong track record of performance and its highly-rated portfolio of top tech stocks, although it should be noted that SMH gives investors considerably more exposure to Nvidia.\n\nIs IYW Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, analysts assign IYW a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 106 Buys,\u00a027 Holds, and two Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average IYW stock price target of $145.91 implies 10.2% upside potential from current levels.\n\n3. Invesco S&P 500 Momentum ETF\u00a0(SPMO)\n\nLastly, the Invesco S&P 500 ETF is another large Nvidia holder with an entirely different approach.\u00a0SPMO is \u201cbased on the S&P 500 Momentum Index,\u201d which \u201ctracks the performance of stocks in the S&P 500 Index that have a high \u2018momentum score.\u2019\u201d The fund and index are reconstituted and rebalanced twice a year, and components of the index are weighted by their market caps and their momentum scores.\n\nNvidia makes up 11.4% of SPMO\u2019s holdings, which is less than SMH\u2019s exposure but more than IYW\u2019s.\u00a0In total, SPMO owns 100 stocks, and its top 10 holdings make up 56.1% of the fund.\n\nBelow is an overview of SPMO\u2019s top 10 holdings using TipRanks\u2019 holdings tool.\n\nSPMO isn\u2019t specifically focused on semiconductor or technology stocks like SMH or IYW, but some of these stocks, like Nvidia and Broadcom, appear in SPMO\u2019s top holdings, as these stocks have been leading the market higher. Beyond semiconductors, Meta Platforms is SPMO\u2019s largest holding, and the fund also owns plenty of names from outside of the tech sector that are performing well, like Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY), General Electric (NYSE:GE), and Walmart (NYSE:WMT).\n\nAn impressive nine out of SPMO\u2019s top 10 holdings feature Outperform-equivalent Smart Scores of 9 or higher.\u00a0Like SMH and IYW, SPMO has also generated good returns over time, although it doesn\u2019t have a track record as long as that of the other two funds, as it only launched in 2015. Still, as of January 31, SPMO had posted a solid three-year annualized return of 10.9% and an even better five-year annualized return of 15.1%.\n\nSPMO is reasonably priced, with an expense ratio of just 0.13%, making it the cheapest of the three funds profiled here. An investor in SPMO will pay just $13 annually in fees on a $10,000 investment. I\u2019m bullish on SPMO based on its decent performance, highly-rated portfolio, and substantial Nvidia position.\n\nIs SPMO Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nAnalysts view the fund favorably, as SPMO earns a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 87 Buys, 12 Holds, and two Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average SPMO stock price target of $81.45 implies 6.3% upside potential from current levels.\n\nNo Shortage of Ways to Invest in Nvidia\n\nAll three of these ETFs are good options for investors, as they have strong portfolios and have generated solid returns over time. Any of the three is a worthy investment, but my pick of the three is SMH, as it offers by far the highest exposure to Nvidia, plus the best performance track record.\n\nDisclosure", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-etfs-big-nvidia-positions-061149600.html", "symbols": ["AAPL.US", "AMAT.US", "AMD.US", "ASML.US", "AVGO.US", "GE.US", "INTC.US", "LLY.US", "LRCX.US", "META.US", "MSFT.US", "NVD.BE", "NVD.DU", "NVD.F", "NVD.HA", "NVD.HM", "NVD.MU", "NVD.STU", "NVD.XETRA", "NVDA.MX"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.998, "neg": 0.041, "neu": 0.843, "pos": 0.116}}, {"date": "2024-02-27T00:00:00+00:00", "title": "3 Tech Stocks Bracing for a Deeper Dive", "content": "While tech equities are rallying, investors would be better off to avoid these three stocks poised for deeper dives in share price.", "link": "https://investorplace.com/2024/02/3-tech-stocks-bracing-for-a-deeper-dive/", "symbols": ["AAPL.US", "OKTA.US", "RIVN.US"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.599, "neg": 0.081, "neu": 0.659, "pos": 0.26}}, {"date": "2024-02-27T00:00:00+00:00", "title": "\nSam Swenson, CFA, CPA\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0Feb 27, 2024\n", "content": "\nSam Swenson, CFA, CPA\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0Feb 27, 2024\n", "link": "https://www.fool.com/terms/c/competitive-advantage/", "symbols": ["AAPL.US"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0, "neg": 0, "neu": 1, "pos": 0}}, {"date": "2024-02-27T00:00:00+00:00", "title": "7 Dividend Stocks Every Investor Should Own to Survive a Market Crash", "content": "Buying dividend stocks for retirement is an excellent way to protect your portfolio in the event of a recession or depression.", "link": "https://investorplace.com/2024/02/7-dividend-stocks-every-investor-should-own-to-survive-a-market-crash-2/", "symbols": ["AAPL.US", "AVGO.US", "JNJ.US", "JPM.US", "KO.US", "MO.US", "MSFT.US"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": -0.052, "neg": 0.226, "neu": 0.556, "pos": 0.219}}, {"date": "2024-02-27T00:00:00+00:00", "title": "3 Starter Tech Stocks Every New Investor Should Own", "content": "These top three key tech stocks for new investors will allow your portfolio to grow greatly now and years into the future -- invest!", "link": "https://investorplace.com/2024/02/3-starter-tech-stocks-every-new-investor-should-own/", "symbols": ["AAPL.US", "MA.US", "MSFT.US"], "tags": [], "sentiment": {"polarity": 0.457, "neg": 0, "neu": 0.846, "pos": 0.154}}]
